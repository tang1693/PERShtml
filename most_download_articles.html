                A methodology for landslide susceptibility mapping using an integrated remote sensing and GIS approach is presented. A part of the Darjeeling Himalaya was selected for the model execution. IRS satellite data, topographic maps, field data, and other informative maps were used as inputs to the study. Important terrain factors, contributing to landslide occurrences in the region, were identified and corresponding thematic data layers were generated. These data layers represent the geological, topographical, and hydrological conditions of the terrain. A numerical rating scheme for the factors was developed for spatial data analysis in a GIS. The resulting landslide susceptibility map delineates the area into different zones of four relative susceptibility classes: high, moderate, low, and very low. The susceptibility map was validated by correlating the landslide frequencies of different classes. This has shown a close agreement with the existing field instability condition. The effectiveness of the map was also confirmed by the high statistically significant value of a chi-square test.

            A New Method for Segmenting Individual Trees from the Lidar Point Cloud

                Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) has been widely applied to characterize the 3-dimensional (3D) structure of forests as it can generate 3D point data with high spatial resolution and accuracy. Individual tree segmentations, usually derived from the canopy height model, are used to derive individual tree structural attributes such as tree height, crown diameter, canopy-based height, and others. In this study, we develop a new algorithm to segment individual trees from the small footprint discrete return airborne lidar point cloud. We experimentally applied the new algorithm to segment trees in a mixed conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California. The results were evaluated in terms of recall, precision, and F-score, and show that the algorithm detected 86 percent of the trees (“recall”), 94 percent of the segmented trees were correct (“precision”), and the overall F-score is 0.9. Our results indicate that the proposed algorithm has good potential in segmenting individual trees in mixed conifer stands of similar structure using small footprint, discrete return lidar data.

            Remote Sensing Techniques to Assess Water Quality
        </a>
    </h3>
    <div style="font-style: italic;">Year: 2003, Volume: 69.0, Issue: 6.0</div>

                Remote sensing techniques can be used to monitor water quality parameters (i.e., suspended sediments (turbidity), chlorophyll, and temperature). Optical and thermal sensors on boats, aircraft, and satellites provide both spatial and temporal information needed to monitor changes in water quality parameters for developing management practices to improve water quality. Recent and planned launches of satellites with improved spectral and spatial resolution sensors should lead to greater use of remote sensing techniques to assess and monitor water quality parameters. Integration of remotely sensed data, GPS, and GIS technologies provides a valuable tool for monitoring and assessing waterways. Remotely sensed data can be used to create a permanent geographically located database to provide a baseline for future comparisons. The integrated use of remotely sensed data, GPS, and GIS will enable consultants and natural resource managers to develop management plans for a variety of natural resource management applications.

            Direct Linear Transformation from Comparator Coordinates into Object Space Coordinates in Close-Range Photogrammetry

                A method for photogrammetric data reduction without the necessity for neither fiducial marks nor initial approximations for inner and outer orientation parameters of the camera has been developed. This approach is particularly suitable for reduction of data from non-metric photography, but has also distinct advantages in its application to metric photography. Preliminary fictitious data tests indicate that the approach is promising. Experiments with real data are underway.

                Landsat, first placed in orbit in 1972, established the U.S. as the world leader in land remote sensing. The Landsat system has contributed significantly to the understanding of the Earth’s environment, spawned revolutionary uses of space-based data by the commercial value-added industry, and encouraged a new generation of commercial satellites that provide regional, high-resolution spatial images. ThisPE&RSSpecial Issue provides an update to the 1997 25th Landsat anniversary issue, particularly focused on the contribution of Landsat-7 to the 34+year history of the Landsat mission. In this overview paper, we place the Landsat-7 system in context and show how mission operations have changed over time, increasingly exploiting the global monitoring capabilities of the Landsat observatory. Although considerable progress was made during the Landsat-7 era, there is much yet to learn about the historical record of Landsat global coverage: a truly valuable national treasure. The time to do so is now, as the memories of the early days of this historic program are fading as we speak.

            Automated 3D Reconstruction of LoD2 and LoD1 Models for All 10 Million Buildings of the Netherlands

                In this paper, we present our workflow to automatically reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) building models based on two-dimensional building polygons and a lidar point cloud. The workflow generates models at different levels of detail (LoDs) to support data requirements of different applications from one consistent source. Specific attention has been paid to make the workflow robust to quickly run a new iteration in case of improvements in an algorithm or in case new input data become available. The quality of the reconstructed data highly depends on the quality of the input data and is monitored in several steps of the process. A 3D viewer has been developed to view and download the openly available 3D data at different LoDs in different formats. The workflow has been applied to all 10 million buildings of the Netherlands. The 3D service will be updated after new input data becomes available.
