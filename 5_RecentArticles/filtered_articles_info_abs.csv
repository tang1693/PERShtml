A Novel Multi-level Feature Collaborative Matching Network for Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar Image Registration,"Pang, Bo; Wang, Lei; Wei, Bo; Zhu, Wenlei; Gao, Haiyun",pp. 753-761(9),N/A,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000012/art00011;jsessionid=27g5ow960hr17.x-ic-live-03,"Due to the complementary characteristics of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical images, image registration as a prerequisite for their information fusion has received increasing attention. Currently, learning-based methods can better handle the significant radiometric and geometric differences between optical and SAR images compared to traditional registration approaches, but they still have limitations in distinguishing difficult samples, making high-precision registration a remaining challenge. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-level feature collaborative matching network (MFC-Net) that effectively integrates high-level abstract features and low-level spatial features for precise registration. Furthermore, a novel dual-dimension joint attention module (DDJA) is designed to dynamically capture feature dependencies across both channel and spatial dimensions, enhancing cross-modal feature consistency and improving matching performance. Additionally, to address the problem of similarity between hard positive and negative samples caused by high-precision registration requirements, a dynamic differentiation factor is introduced at the loss function level, enabling the model to better distinguish between these similar samples in training. Extensive experiments conducted on the WHU-OPT-SAR data set and WHU-SENCity data set demonstrate that the proposed MFC-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both matching accuracy and precision, validating its superiority in cross-modal image registration tasks."
Joint Detection and Parameters Regression of Detailed Windows based on Facade Textures via an Adaptive Soft Teacher,"Hu, Han; Li, Chenwei; Xu, Bo; Chen, Min; Zhu, Qing; Han, Zujie; Ning, Xinwen; Fu, Xuesong",pp. 763-775(13),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000012/art00013;jsessionid=27g5ow960hr17.x-ic-live-03,"The detailed and precise reconstruction of building facades with semantic information conforming to the level-of-detail protocol has drawn increasing attention in recent years. However, despite windows being a major component of building facades, current research often oversimplifies them in the modeling process, primarily focusing on their location and size. This study proposes a joint approach to simultaneously address window detection and detailed parametric modeling. All required window information, including type, location, and interior structure parameters, is obtained via an end-to-end network. This information is then consolidated into predefined window syntax accessible via the SketchUp Ruby application programming interface (API), resulting in the construction of detailed three-dimensional window models. To resolve the issue of training the network with limited labeled data, an adaptive threshold method based on Soft Teacher is proposed, leveraging the pseudolabel technique and consistency regularization to enhance detection precision. Experiments performed on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve improved window-detection precision with reduced cell estimation errors compared with existing Faster R-CNN???based methods. The mean average precision and average precision at the intersection of union = 0.5 (AP50) metrics increased from 47.9% and 61.9% to 69.0% and 83.1%, respectively. The mean absolute error metric for cell estimation improved from 0.103 to 0.076."
"Evaluating Three-Dimensional Elevation Program Lidar Consistency and Accuracy at Scale Using Cloud-Native, Open-Source Methods","Sampath, Aparajithan; Irwin, Jeffrey R.; Stoker, Jason M.",pp. 777-785(9),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000012/art00015;jsessionid=27g5ow960hr17.x-ic-live-03,"The U.S. Geological Survey three-dimensional elevation program (3DEP) has significantly expanded national lidar coverage, necessitating scalable, reproducible methods for assessing data quality across diverse terrains and acquisition conditions. This study introduces a cloud-native, open-source workflow designed to evaluate the geometric accuracy and consistency of 3DEP lidar data sets at a national scale. Leveraging tools such as the Point Data Abstraction Library, Open3D, and Amazon Web Services infrastructure, the workflow integrates global navigation satellite system???surveyed ground control points and terrestrial laser scanning data to validate airborne lidar collections. Two case studies demonstrate the application of this process. In Puerto Rico, the process identified vertical biases and inconsistencies in vegetated areas, while in Iowa and Arizona, the process confirmed high vertical accuracy with minimal bias. The results underscore the effectiveness of combining cloud computing with open-source tools to perform large-scale lidar data quality assessments. This process offers a reproducible, efficient solution for nationwide validation of 3DEP data sets, supporting enhanced decision-making in geospatial applications."
ETF-MNet:A Multi-Scale Fusion Network for Enhancing Target Features for Remote Sensing Images,"Shan, Huilin; Wang, Shuoyang; Hu, Yuxiang; Chen, Xin; Wu, Xinyue; Zhang, Yinsheng",pp. 787-797(11),N/A,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000012/art00017;jsessionid=27g5ow960hr17.x-ic-live-03,"In response to the challenges of dense target distribution, significant scale variations, and limited feature information for small objects in remote sensing images, this paper introduces a multi-scale fusion network with enhanced target features. Initially, a multi-layer feature aggregation module is constructed within the backbone network to enhance the capability of feature extraction. Subsequently, a multi-channel feature fusion module is implemented in the neck portion of the network to effectively capture cross-channel information and further enhance the expressive power of features at different scales. Moreover, a bi-directional multi-scale feature fusion module is proposed as a mechanism for feature fusion, using top-down and bottom-up fusion strategies to facilitate information interaction among features at different levels. Finally, in the detection layer, a fractional Fourier transform is applied to the image to extract additional feature information, which, combined with convolutional operations, improves the accuracy of small object detection. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments were conducted on the data set for object detection in aerial images and Northwestern Polytechnical University very high resolution 10 data sets. The average detection accuracy achieved was 78.7% and 95.4%, respectively. Computational complexity was measured at 95.6 G, and the overall model size was 30.7 M. These results demonstrate that the proposed method excels at high detection accuracy, low computational complexity, and strong feature representation capability. It effectively improves the detection accuracy of small objects in remote sensing images, thereby enhancing the overall performance of small object detection in remote sensing imagery."
Assessing the Accuracy of a 2021 Kansas‐Oklahoma Tallgrass Ecosystem Burn Area Map,"Iiames, John; Congalton, Russell G.; Avey, Lance; Miller, Steven; Ebert, Don; Grier, Gina",pp. 799-807(9),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000012/art00019;jsessionid=27g5ow960hr17.x-ic-live-03,"Systematic spring season burning of the tallgrass prairie in eastern Kansas and northeastern Oklahoma has been used by ranchers and ecologists for over 150 years to encourage forage production and reduce invasive species propagation and woody species encroachment in the Kansas Flint Hills and Oklahoma Osage Tallgrass ecoregion. On average, 8100 km2is burned yearly during the March to April burn window. Despite the beneficial effects resulting from spring burning, air resource managers must also account for the particulates emitted from the combustion of these fuels. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) has mapped spring burn area over the Flint Hills (Kansas) and Osage (Oklahoma) regions since 2011 by processing satellite data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard both the Aqua and Terra satellite platforms. Understanding the accuracy of these maps is useful for understanding PM2.5 impacts to the local communities and the surrounding states. We conducted both a sample unit???based and an area???based assessment of the 4 April 2021 burn area map to determine map accuracy and identified potential sources of error, both “commission” (i.e., mapped a burn area where there was no burn) and “omission” (i.e., did not map a burn area where a burn actually occurred). The results indicate that the KDHE 2021 map achieved high overall accuracies (>94%), yet these accuracies were not consistent over the entire area. Omission and commission errors were three to four times larger in areas that had higher burn area percentages, partially due to increased burn edge, promoting larger numbers of mixed 250-m cells. Another source of error was from the prior year (2020) fall burn scars that were occasionally identified as spring burns over the 2021 burn season. The area-based assessment method provided additional information from the sample unit???based method and was useful in identifying anomalous assessment results dependent on the geographical location within the tallgrass system."
An Efficient Irregular Texture Nesting Method via Hybrid NFP-SADE with Adaptive Container Resizing,"Lou, Liyuan; Li, Wanyun; Yu, Jingle; Wang, Xin; Zhan, Zongqian",pp. 681-691(11),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000011/art00008;jsessionid=uv2785qehdkt.x-ic-live-02,"Efficient irregular texture nesting, which is necessary for improving the efficiency of texture mapping and 3D model rendering, especially for large-scale 3D reconstruction tasks, has emerged as a critical research topic in the fields of photogrammetry, computer graphics, and computer vision. However, persistent inefficiencies and high computational costs in existing texture nesting algorithms pose significant challenges when dealing with vast quantities of irregularly shaped texture patches. To solve this problem, this work presents an efficient and well structured texture nesting for reorganizing irregular textures in a space efficient and time efficient way. More specifically, a hybrid optimization approach that integrates an enhanced no fit polygon (NFP) method with an improved simplified atavistic differential evolution (SADE) algorithm is proposed. The canonical SADE is reformulated, tailored for texture nesting optimization, and a novel self-adaptive container resizing strategy is used to surpass traditional NFP approaches in polygon processing efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves irregular texture nesting efficiency, achieving speed improvements of up to 5.44 times compared with the common genetic algorithm–based method and 5.21 times over the simulated annealing–based method. Furthermore, it consistently improves space use by approximately 6.56%, indicating a more effective layout strategy and optimized resource use.

Thermal Point Cloud Generation and Evaluation from Uncalibrated Unmanned Aerial Vehicle–Visible and Infrared Camera Images Using Position and Orientation System Prior,"Liu, Siqi; Wang, Qiang; Fan, Shenghong; Cui, Ximin; Zou, Yue; Liang, Yubin; Wang, Qian",pp. 693-702(10),N/A,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000011/art00010;jsessionid=uv2785qehdkt.x-ic-live-02,"This paper presents a methodology for thermal infrared (TIR) point cloud acquisition, leveraging information from the visible camera, TIR camera, and their respective unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) position and their position and orientation systems (POSs) prior. First, the visible images and their corresponding UAV POS information are used to generate a red–green–blue (RGB) dense point cloud with geographic coordinates; subsequently, using the RGB dense point cloud as a reference, the acquisition of a calibration parameter between global navigation satellite system/inertial measurement unit and the TIR camera is conducted using the POS information corresponding to the selected TIR images; finally, a TIR point cloud of the entire survey area is generated based on the calibration parameters. The availability and suitability of the fused TIR point cloud generated and UAV POS data are also evaluated in terms of localization deviations and orientation deviations. The experimental results demonstrate that the acquisition of coarse quality TIR point cloud can be achieved by using a priori POS data provided by different small UAVs. The TIR point cloud generated by the UAV POS data guidance can be directly applied to medium and large-sized buildings. The POS guided projected images achieved an 86.67% registration success rate with the TIR images, indicating that the orientation deviations are within acceptable limits and establishing a solid foundation for subsequent fine fusion."
Landsat-Derived Rainfed and Irrigated-Area Product for Conterminous United States for the Year 2020 (LRIP30 CONUS 2020) Using Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning on the Cloud,"Teluguntla, Pardhasaradhi; Thenkabail, Prasad S.; Oliphant, Adam; Aneece, Itiya; Biggs, Trent; Gumma, Murali Krishna; Foley, Daniel; McCormick, Richard; Neelam, Rohitha; Long, Emerson; Lawton, Jake",pp. 703-714(12),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000011/art00012;jsessionid=uv2785qehdkt.x-ic-live-02,"Accurate maps of irrigated and rainfed croplands are crucial for assessing global food and water security. Irrigated croplands yield two to four times more grain and biomass than rainfed croplands. To meet rising food demand, the proportion of cropland that is irrigated must be increased globally. Because agriculture uses 80% to 90% of global fresh water, understanding changes in cropland extent, crop type, and irrigation is critical for meeting nutritional needs sustainably. The United States has one of the most productive rainfed and irrigated croplands in the world and is a leading producer and exporter of agricultural crops. Precise maps of irrigated and rainfed croplands in the United States are crucial for assessing the current and the future agricultural production capacity in supporting food security. We developed a 30-m resolution rainfed and irrigated area map for the conterminous United States derived from 2019 to 2021 multi-date Landsat-8 data (LRIP30 CONUS 2020). A total of 96 harmonized spectral bands comprising monthly median value composites of eight bands (blue, green, red, NIR, SWIR1, SWIR2, TIR, and enhanced vegetation index [EVI]) were used. A cropland mask was then applied, and reference data were sourced from various sources. A pixel based supervised random forest classifier, and pixel based unsupervised ISODATA clustering classifier were implemented on Google Earth Engine and the ERDAS Imagine workstation to classify, identify, map, and assess accuracies of irrigated and rainfed cropland areas. The LRIP30 CONUS 2020 product achieved an overall accuracy of 93.9%. The irrigated and rainfed classes had producer's accuracies of 90.2% and 95.7%, respectively, and user's accuracies of 90.8% and 95.4%, respectively. The total net cropland area was estimated at 139.4 million hectares (Mha), of which 94.9 Mha (68%) was classified as rainfed and 44.5 Mha (32%) was classified as irrigated. State level summaries highlight regional differences and their implications for national and global food and water security."
Novel Spatiotemporal ConvLSTM-Based Cellular Automata Model for Simulating Urban Expansion,"Zhou, Ye; Qiu, Yu; Wu, Tao; Lv, Laishui",pp. 715-726(12),N/A,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000011/art00013;jsessionid=uv2785qehdkt.x-ic-live-02,"Accurately capturing and simulating the spatiotemporal dynamics of urban expansion remains a persistent challenge in urban planning and environmental management. Traditional machine learning methods often struggle to capture the complexity of spatial features and the multi-scale spatiotemporal dynamics involved in deriving the transition rules of cellular automata (CA), making it difficult to balance detailed local expansion with broader overall trends during the urban expansion simulation process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel spatiotemporal CA model based on the convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) neural network. This model, termed ST-ConvLSTM-CA, simultaneously enhances critical spatial features and incorporates multi-scale spatiotemporal features by integrating the shuffle attention mechanism and a spatiotemporal expression (SE) block into the ConvLSTM architecture. First, the channel dimensions of spatial features are grouped and channel spatial attention is performed in parallel, allowing for efficient fusion and weighting of key spatial features with minimal computational cost. Second, the SE module is used to integrate the multi-scale information within ConvLSTM cells, enhancing the representation of neighborhood details across different spatial granularities and capturing dynamic temporal features. Finally, the improved model generates conversion probability maps, which are used by the CA model to simulate time series urban expansion maps. Using the urban agglomerations of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the Yangtze River Delta, and Beijing-Tianjing-Tangshan as case studies, results show that ST-ConvLSTM-CA achieves the highest accuracy across all three regions. This demonstrates its robust adaptability to complex spatiotemporal data and superior predictive performance."
Global Multi-Scale Fusion Self-Calibration Network for Remote Sensing Object Detection,"Chen, Yan; Shi, Xinlu; Wang, Xiaofeng; Gu, Qi; Zhang, Chen; Xu, Lixiang; Zhan, Shian; Yu, Wenle",pp. 607-621(15),N/A,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000010/art00007;jsessionid=6dinnfh031pb.x-ic-live-03,"Applications of remote sensing images in both defense and civilian sectors have spurred substantial research interest. In the field of remote sensing, object detection confronts challenges such as complex backgrounds, scale diversity, and the presence of dense small objects. To address these issues, we propose an improved deep learning-based model, the Global Multi-scale Fusion Self-calibration Network, which is expected to contribute to alleviating the challenges. It consists of three main components: the hierarchical feature aggregation backbone, which uses improved modules such as the receptive field context-aware feature extraction module, the global information acquisition module, and the simple parameter-free attention module to extract key features and minimize the background interference. To couple multi-scale features, we enhanced the fusing component and designed the multi-scale enhanced pyramid structure integrating the proposed new modules. During the detection phase, especially when focusing on small object detection, we designed a novel convolutional attention feature fusion head. This head is constructed to integrate local and global branches for feature extraction by leveraging channel shuffling and multi-head attention mechanisms for efficient and accurate detection. Experiments on the Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images (DIOR), Northwestern Polytechnical University Very High-Resolution‐10 (NWPU VHR‐10), remote sensing object detection (RSOD), and DOTAv1.0 data sets show that our method achieves mAP50(mean average precision at 50% intersection over union) of 69.7%, 91.3%, 94.2%, and 70.0%, respectively, outperforming existing comparative methods. The proposed network is expected to provide new perspectives for remote sensing tasks and possible solutions for relevant applications in the image domain."
MRTD-Based Effective Range Analysis of Airborne Infrared Imaging Systems for Ship Detection: Optimization of the Calculation for Operational Range Through an Improved MRTD Model,"Yan, Peng; Tian, Yuyang; Ling, Xiao; Zhu, Kaikai; Sheng, Qinghong; Wang, Bo; Li, Jun; Liu, Xiang; Xu, Xiao",pp. 623-630(8),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000010/art00010;jsessionid=6dinnfh031pb.x-ic-live-03,"When the airborne infrared imaging system detects ships, significant variations in environmental temperature are often observed. In the existing calculation models for the operating range, the factor of environmental temperature has not been taken into account. However, when the environmental temperature changes, it will affect the variation of the minimum resolvable temperature difference (MRTD) of the system, resulting in a relatively large deviation in the prediction of the operating range of the airborne infrared imaging system. To address this crucial technical challenge, this study systematically established the relationship formula of the MRTD under different temperatures. By integrating with the improved theoretical model of MRTD, a calculation method for the operating range that takes environmental temperature into consideration was developed to accurately determine the operating range of the airborne infrared imaging system. Comparative experimental studies focusing on ships show that, compared with traditional methods, the prediction deviation of the proposed method is significantly reduced, with an average reduction of 10.1%."
Convolutional Neural Networks for Land Use and Land Cover Multi-class Maps from Historical Aerial Photographs,"Kostrzewa, Adam",pp. 631-645(15),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000010/art00011;jsessionid=6dinnfh031pb.x-ic-live-03,"Historical maps that describe past land use and land cover (LULC) forms can be a precious source of information in many scientific fields studying long-term spatial and temporal changes in the landscape. Such repositories were created manually in small areas in the past, which was a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. Recently, there has been a growing tendency to use machine learning models for this purpose, along with deep learning methods. However, having a massive amount of labeled data is necessary for these methods to train the networks. Training data are often manually labeled, posing a significant challenge and limiting the automation of these methods. This article presents a method that uses topographic databases to extract complex multi-class maps representing LULC from historical aerial photographs, eliminating the time-consuming data labeling step. The method uses transfer learning with a pretrained model on 2020 and 2014 data and attempts to reconstruct LULC types with the same convolutional neural network (CNN) network on archived images from 2006. The experiment covered 488 km2and included seven LULC classes. The method was tested using different CNN architectures (U-Net, Pyramid Scene Parsing Network [PSPNet], and LinkNet) with backbones (ResNeXt+SE, EfficientNet, and Inception). The PSPNet‐EfficientNet‐b7 network model achieved the best results, with 90% overall accuracy for predicting LULC classes based on the 2006 archived aerial images."

Originally launched to address the lack of national-scale, moderate-resolution land-cover data, NLCD has evolved from the pioneering 1992 dataset into a comprehensive, annually updated product suite. Key innovations include the introduction of impervious surface mapping, forest canopy mapping, standardized Landsat mosaics, national-scale accuracy assessments, continual evolution of deep learning and artificial intelligence methodologies, and a transition toward operational, change-focused monitoring. The NLCD has become an essential resource for scientific research, land management, and policy development, with extensive adoption across federal, state, and local agencies; academia; and the private sector. The NLCD data underpin a wide array of applications, including biodiversity conservation, urban planning, hydrology, human health studies, and natural hazard assessment. As new global and high-resolution commercial land-cover products emerge, the NLCD continues to distinguish itself through its temporal depth, federal backing, and thematic consistency. Moving forward, the NLCD will maintain its niche as the leading, moderate-resolution, long-term land-cover and land-change dataset for the United States, ensuring continued support for broad national applications while complementing higher-resolution and global-mapping efforts."

Finally, a robust crack estimation algorithm based on grid geometry analysis is proposed to extract accurate crack parameters in the presence of complex speckle texture interference. To verify the superiority and reliability of the proposed approach, both a simulation test and an empirical test were conducted.

Lightweight and Accurate Video Synthetic Aperture Radar Target Detection Network,"Ma, Huilian; Li, Yinwei; Li, Weisong; Zhu, Yiming",pp. 573-581(9),N/A,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000009/art00011;jsessionid=1vhoin0krrgm7.x-ic-live-03,"Video synthetic aperture radar (SAR) target detection has seen rapid development in recent years, but current methods generally suffer from high computational complexity as well as frequent false alarms and missed alarms. Additionally, in video SAR scenarios, small targets become more difficult to identify due to low resolution and complex backgrounds. Recently, leveraging shadows for video SAR moving target detection has proven advantageous as it provides accurate location information and additional boundary details. To address the challenges of target detection in video SAR caused by low resolution and complex backgrounds, as well as the high computational cost of current methods, this paper proposes a lightweight algorithm for video SAR shadow detection based on the YOLOv5 architecture, named Lavs-DeNet. First, a lightweight feature extraction backbone network combining both global and local information called CGLLNet is proposed. This backbone improves the detection performance by mitigating false alarms and missed alarms caused by defocus in video SAR images. Next, a slanted ladder bidirectional feature pyramid network (SL‐BiFPN) is designed. By using tilted upsampling with multiple stacked layers, this network efficiently extracts multi-scale features, further reducing missed alarms. Finally, a lightweight information interaction module (LII‐C3) has been developed, significantly reducing computational complexity. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments were conducted using the data set released by Sandia National Laboratories. The experimental results show that the proposed Lavs-DeNet can achieve 97.88% detection accuracy, requiring only 21.02G floating points and 0.88M parameters, which is superior to the current classical video SAR target detection networks."
Hierarchical Multi-Scale Cross Interaction Network for Enhanced Hyperspectral Image Classification,"Feng, Yuting; Yang, Lina; Wu, Thomas; Huang, Youju",pp. 495-507(13),N/A,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000008/art00010;jsessionid=1sve6m5hl1rfb.x-ic-live-01,"The significance of hyperspectral image classification lies in its ability to discern subtle differences between materials, making it essential in fields such as agriculture, mineral exploration, and urban planning. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer-based methods have become standard for hyperspectral imagery classification, with hybrid approaches gaining popularity. Yet, these methods often lack efficient interaction between the features extracted by CNNs and transformers. To address this, we propose the hierarchical multiscale cross interaction network (HMCI-Net), which leverages both CNNs and transformers to enhance classification accuracy. The CNN branch extracts local spatial-spectral features, and the transformer branch captures global spectral information, allowing the network to model long-range dependencies and complex correlations. Additionally, HMCI-Net incorporates a hierarchical multi-scale feature extraction module and a multi-view feature fusion module, further improving its ability to extract fine-grained, multi-perspective features. Extensive experiments on four benchmark hyperspectral data sets—Indian Pines, Pavia University, WHU-Hi-LongKou, and Houston2013—demonstrate that HMCI-Net outperforms existing methods, achieving an average improvement of 6.24% in average accuracy, 6.14% in kappa coefficient, and 5.55% in overall accuracy. Specifically, HMCI-Net achieves significant gains, with overall accuracy higher by 8.86%, 4.34%, 4.44%, and 4.42% on Indian Pines, Pavia University, WHU-HiLongKou, and Houston2013, respectively. Similarly, average accuracy is higher by 10.57%, 4.94%, 5.65%, and 4.81% for Indian Pines, Pavia University, WHU-Hi-LongKou, and Houston2013, respectively; kappa coefficient is higher by 10.39%, 4.88%, 4.70%, and 4.60%, respectively, on these data sets.

This study aims to tackle these challenges by using precise and accurate aerial remote sensing data to support the restoration and sustainable prosperity of coral reef systems. Specifically, this study develops and applies an efficient coral survey method based on aerial remote sensing. The method integrates aerial imagery and bathymetric lidar (light detection and ranging) point cloud data and uses advanced photogrammetric computer vision and deep learning algorithms. Using a state-of-the-art multi-modal neural network segmentation technique, the proposed method enables high-precision and intelligent identification of coral reefs, facilitating detailed habitat mapping. Furthermore, by accurately delineating the habitat range and geometric structures of reefs, this approach allows for precise measurements of coral biomass production and skeletal calcification. These metrics help assess coral reef structural complexity and their adaptability to environmental stressors, providing robust scientific data for conservation strategies and policy making. The use of advanced multi-modal aerial remote sensing data not only enhances monitoring reliability and accuracy but also offers a cost-effective and flexible tool for coral reef ecological mapping. This approach effectively addresses challenges encountered in coastal ecological surveys, particularly in areas where direct human access or boat entry is difficult."
On the Transferability of Semantic Segmentation for Very-High-Resolution Remote Sensing Data of Multi-City Environments,"Qin, Rongjun; Zhang, Guixiang; Tang, Yang",pp. 517-528(12),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000008/art00014;jsessionid=1sve6m5hl1rfb.x-ic-live-01,"Semantic segmentation of very-high-resolution remote sensing (RS) data is foundational for many RS applications in urban environments. Images from sources like Worldview-3/4 and Pleiades-Neo offer resolutions as high as 0.3 m, enabling a fine-grained understanding of urban structures. Recent deep learning‐based methods have significantly outperformed traditional approaches in RS semantic segmentation/classification tasks. However, they require large training data sets and often lack transferability due to highly disparate RS image content across different geographical regions. However, no comprehensive analysis exists on their transferability—i.e., to what extent a model trained on a source domain can be applied to a target domain in urban areas. This paper investigates the raw transferability of traditional and deep-learning models and the effectiveness of domain adaptation approaches in enhancing deep-learning model transferability (adapted transferability). Using five highly diverse RS data sets from different cities (6792 patches of 1024 × 1024 pixels each), we trained six models with and without three domain adaptation approaches to quantitatively analyze transferability between data sets. To facilitate easy assessment of model transferability, we developed a simple method to quantify transferability using spectral indices as a medium, demonstrating its effectiveness in evaluating model transferability at the target domain when labels are unavailable. Our experiments yield several important but underreported observations on raw and adapted transferability. Moreover, our proposed label-free transferability assessment method outperforms posterior model confidence and can guide model selection for urban studies globally. The models and datasets are publicly available on GitHub at: https://github.com/GDAOSU/Transferability-Remote-Sensing."
Combined Use of Satellite Observations and the RIM for Assessing Recovery from Natural Disasters,"Cao, Changyong; Wang, Wenhui; Bai, Yan; Shao, Xi; Uprety, Sirish; Qiu, Hong-Lie",pp. 407-417(11),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000007/art00010;jsessionid=885scc794ifar.x-ic-live-03,"In this study, we explore using satellite observations to assess community recovery from natural disasters such as fires and hurricanes, supplementing the Resilience Inference Model (RIM). The RIM model has been successfully used to quantify recoveries from hurricanes along the Gulf Coast, but it relies on long-term population changes over years or decades. Our approach integrates satellite observations to enhance recovery assessment with a shorter latency of weeks or months. Using fire, vegetation, and night light data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) with daily global observations, Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite/Advanced Baseline Imager, we quantitatively evaluate fire intensity, light outage, and urban greenness changes, along with subsequent recovery, focusing on the 2023 Maui fire and selected hurricane cases along the Gulf Coast. This approach complements the RIM model by introducing quantifiable physical parameters with shorter latency, particularly beneficial in areas where census data are either unavailable or unreliable."
Analysis of Landslide Susceptibility of the Darjeeling District Using a Frequency Ratio Model and Geographical Weighted Regression,"Sen, Suhel; Sarif, Md.Omar",pp. 419-432(14),N/A,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000007/art00012;jsessionid=885scc794ifar.x-ic-live-03,"India yearly experiences natural disasters such as floods, droughts, cyclones, and landslides, which not only disrupt but also significantly affect the socioeconomic activities of its people. Darjeeling, one of the most valuable districts of West Bengal, India, is located in the foothills of the mighty Himalayas. Landslides in Darjeeling, particularly during the monsoon season, severely affect the socioeconomic conditions of the local population. This research creates a landslide susceptibility map of Darjeeling using the frequency ratio model (FRM) and geographical weighted regression (GWR). The study considers 16 landslide-conditioning factors and 743 past landslide events, of which 70% are used for modeling and the remaining 30% are used for validation. The generated landslide susceptibility map categorizes the area into very low, low, moderate, high, and very high susceptibility zones. Results show that most of the study area falls within the high susceptibility zone, covering approximately 28.45% of the region. The study also reveals that the northern hilly regions of the district are more prone to landslides compared with the southern part, based on FRM and GWR. The area under curve indicates that the model achieved a 74.7% success rate. The highest value of the landslide density index was found in areas classified as having very high landslide susceptibility. Therefore, considering the landslide susceptibility, implementation of effective management strategies is essential for ensuring the future development of the district."
Leadership in COVID-19: Mitigation Strategies across Top 30 Gross Domestic Product Countries,"Ozdenerol, Esra; Bingham-Byrne, Rebecca Michelle",pp. 433-442(10),N/A,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000007/art00014;jsessionid=885scc794ifar.x-ic-live-03,"This study analyzes COVID-19 response strategies in the top 30 gross domestic product countries from the first case until 30 September 2021, a period marked by increased vaccinations, the dominance of the Delta variant, and changing public health measures. We examined which mitigation efforts effectively reduced new cases and the viral reproduction rate. Vaccination policies, movement restrictions, and mask mandates were critical in reducing cases per million, while testing, public information, income support, and contact tracing were crucial for lowering the viral reproduction rate. Vaccination policies did not significantly affect the reproduction rate during implementation. The gender of leaders showed no significant effect on cases, deaths, or excess mortality, though female leaders generally implemented fewer isolation days and prioritized additional measures like movement restrictions and stay-at-home orders."
Lyme Disease Risk Map and Prioritizing Areas for Vaccine Deployment,"Bingham-Byrne, Rebecca Michelle; Ozdenerol",pp. 443-454(12),N/A,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000007/art00015;jsessionid=885scc794ifar.x-ic-live-03,"Disease surveillance, including risk modeling, is beneficial for infectious diseases. Risk prediction maps can be used to prioritize areas to deliver vaccines reducing disease transmission. For zoonotic infectious diseases such as Lyme disease, potential vaccine deployment areas include cost-effective places key to vectors, wildlife hosts, and humans. This paper uses machine-learning techniques to develop models to predict Lyme disease risk, then uses the critical variables within the models, as well those considered principal from previous literature, to create a Lyme disease risk map and to prioritize areas for wildlife vaccine deployment. It was found that highest disease risk is in the eastern United States, especially the upper Midwest and Northeast regions, which coincides with previous literature. The study found national parks and counties within these areas to prioritize wildlife vaccine deployment. Future work includes ground-truthing of the risk map and dispersal of vaccine to priority areas."

This paper presents a novel approach for identifying residential buildings by leveraging multiple source data and a transfer learning model, with a case study conducted in Galveston Island, Texas. We propose an integrated framework that combines very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery, lidar data, points of interest (POI) data, and GIS-based land use information to extract features of residential buildings. We fine-tune a pretrained deep learning model with our data sets to enhance the model’s adaptability and efficiency in detecting residential buildings in the study area. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high accuracy in identifying residential buildings, with overall accuracy of 85.6% in the case study. This study also offers valuable insights into the potential of combining multiple data sources and transfer learning techniques for improving residential building identification and other related tasks in urban remote sensing applications."
Spatiotemporal Continuous Shallow Water Bathymetry from a Kriged Kalman Filter,"Wang, Lei; Liu, Hongxing; Kang, Lei; Su, Haibin; Shu, Song; Wang, Jun",pp. 463-471(9),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000007/art00017;jsessionid=885scc794ifar.x-ic-live-03,"In GIScience, problems of missing data in space or time are nontrivial. We implemented a Kriged Kalman filter (KKF)‐based data interpolation and assimilation technique and tested it for mapping bathymetry at unsampled locations and times. This technique integrates the Kriging and Kalman filter computation frameworks to perform spatiotemporal data assimilation, which can produce spatially and temporally continuous bathymetric fields from samples that are scarce in space and time. The spatiotemporal bathymetric field over the estuary of the Yangtze River was mapped based on the four boat-based depth echo-sounding surveys conducted in 1982, 1997, 2002, and 2010. Our validation and verification analyses showed that the KKF assimilation model can predict bathymetry accurately and reliably at unsampled locations and times. This paper demonstrates that KKF is superior to traditional spatial interpolation methods because it informs the interpolator with the temporal component that also extends the prediction to the time domain. The experiments indicate that greater time intervals in conducting bathymetric surveys result in a more pronounced influence on the performance of KKF than the spatial sparsity of depth samples. The ability of space-time prediction of bathymetry allows underwater depth measurements to be accurately aligned with satellite images, which is essential for improving multispectral image inversion in bathymetry studies."
Texture-Semantic Point: Registration for Point Clouds of Porcelain Relics,"Ge, Xuming; Wu, Chengze; Chen, Min; Xu, Bo; Zhu, Qing; Hu, Han",pp. 347-360(14),N/A,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000006/art00012;jsessionid=34139kugvfn5a.x-ic-live-02,"Point cloud models of porcelain are captured through the multi-registration of point clouds, which presents a challenging task. On the one hand, the smooth surface of porcelain lacks geometric feature variation, making it difficult to establish corresponding points. On the other hand, the overall geometric symmetry of most porcelain relics can easily lead to iterative calculations falling into the local minimum convergence trap. To address the difficulties in feature point selection, we propose a novel approach using texture-semantic points as features for coarse registration. We first select rich texture points as 2D candidates and establish a 2D-3D matching relationship, giving each candidate its 3D spatial location and associated texture information. Using these correspondences, we perform coarse alignment of the point clouds. However, in reality, the point clouds are not aligned, and the registration calculation fails because of geometric symmetry issues. To address this, we integrate a control net into the iterative closest point (ICP) calculation to guide iterations towards the correct Special Euclidean group in 3 dimensions (SE(3)) transformation, achieving refined alignment. Finally, considering porcelain's symmetrical geometry, we introduce a pose optimization constraint using the symmetry axis as a weighted parameter to limit degrees of freedom and enhance registration accuracy. Experiments were conducted on seven porcelain datasets to evaluate the proposed approach. A qualitative analysis demonstrated successful refined alignment using the proposed approach. In addition, we performed a quantitative comparison with state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results showed that our approach outperformed others across all models when applied to the registration of geometrically symmetric porcelain; Specifically, the proposed method achieved a 50% enhancement in accuracy compared with others, measured by the distance between the labeled corresponding points."
A High-Quality Underwater 3D Reconstruction Solution for Coral Reef Environments Leveraging Advanced Photogrammetric Computer Vision Techniques,"Zhong, Jiageng; Li, Ming; Gruen, Armin; Liao, Xuan; Qin, Jiangying; Wang, Bing",pp. 361-370(10),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000006/art00014;jsessionid=34139kugvfn5a.x-ic-live-02,"Coral reefs, with their intricate 3D structures, are vital marine ecosystems increasingly threatened by environmental stressors. Accurate 3D reconstruction of these underwater structures is essential for scientific research and conservation management. While underwater photogrammetry has emerged as a promising tool for this purpose, technical challenges persist in capturing fine-scale features under underwater conditions, particularly the intricate morphology of coral reefs and the highly complex textures that hinder high-fidelity reconstruction. Recent breakthroughs in computer vision and deep learning have introduced new opportunities for underwater photogrammetry. This study begins by outlining a photogrammetric workflow that can integrate current advanced technologies, followed by summarizing cutting-edge methods used in the key stages, i. e., sparse and dense reconstruction. Building on previous research, we propose a hierarchical reconstruction strategy for accurate and efficient dense modeling. Our approach first performs an efficient global coarse-grained reconstruction to capture the overall scene structure, followed by fine-scale modeling in key regions of interest. Using image data collected from a coral reef site at Moorea Island, we compare and evaluate various techniques, analyzing their respective strengths and limitations. In sparse reconstruction, the classical feature method scale-invariant feature transform demonstrates competitive performance. Deep learning–based methods, such as ALIKED feature and the SuperGlue matching network, achieve superior results on certain metrics. For dense reconstruction, Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting–based methods yield high-quality reconstructions but are computationally intensive. In contrast, the deep learning–based multi-view stereo approach achieves comparable reconstruction quality with greater efficiency. Experimental results on reconstruction result fusion further validate that our approach offers a scalable and practical solution for coral reef monitoring, advancing conservation science and ecosystem management practices."

There are some problems in traditional artificial extraction methods for CR points, such as the difficulty of identifying CR points without prior knowledge, low efficiency, and limited extraction accuracy. An extraction method of the phase center for CR points without prior knowledge was proposed in this paper through the construction of a geometric error compensation model for SAR images and the study of high precision fitting methods of the phase center for CR points. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by the Gaofen-3 (GF-3) satellite image data. Experimental results demonstrated that the extraction accuracy of CR points could be better than 0.2 pixel for GF-3 images."

The efficacy of the proposed model is validated through application to both simulation data and actual field test data. Comparative analysis with wave period and direction derived from traditional spectral analysis methods reveals a reduction in root mean square error by 0.08 s and 5.5°, respectively, alongside an increase in correlation coefficient by 8% and 9%, respectively, demonstrating that the intelligent method enhances the accuracy of ocean wave parameter inversion without requiring prior knowledge."

Furthermore, different crop types have unique spectral, spatial, and phenological characteristics that have not been well understood and fully used for the expected results. This study established a crop-classification framework using the random forest model by integrating four types of features (i. e., spectral reflectance features, vegetation index features, spatial texture features, and crop phenological features) over 15 scenarios generated from Sentinel-2 images. The random forest model performed best (overall accuracy = 92.86%; Kappa coefficient = 0.8995) by integrating the four types of features. We systematically assessed the contribution of feature combinations on individual crop classification. Specifically, different feature combinations can effectively improve the recognition accuracy of different crop types. Our findings can provide great potential in choosing optimal features for crop classifications and benefit the application of machine learning in remote sensing–based crop mapping."

Existing methods work primarily only on aerial data, depend on an external digital terrain model, or do not accurately separate individual buildings. In this work, we present SAT2BUILDING, a method that predicts roof planes, building sections, and building heights in a single, fully convolutional neural network. The network relies on only orthorectified panchromatic imagery and a photogrammetric digital surface model. The three outputs are jointly processed in a level of detail–2 reconstruction pipeline that generates building models that are seamlessly connected, geometrically accurate and complete, and topologically correct. We use spatial embeddings that enable accurate segmentation of building sections and roof planes from satellite imagery. The model generalizes to data from Bonn, Germany, and Lyon, France, after being trained on data from Berlin, Germany. The training and test data differ in lighting conditions, architectural styles, and ground sampling distances. Thorough comparative evaluation shows the superiority of SAT2BUILDING over three baseline methods."

Results indicate: (1) Carbon content coefficients of Moso bamboo leaves, branches, and culms under pest stress ranged from 0.422 to 0.543 g/g, decreasing with increased stress. (2) A random forest model using multi-source data demonstrated the best performance (R2 = 0.688), estimating average AGC at 28.427 t/ha and total carbon sequestration at 913.902 MtC (Million tons of Carbon). (3) Increased pest stress resulted in gradual reductions in AGC. (4) Pest stress is estimated to result in a carbon sequestration loss of 77.443 MtC.

To mitigate this challenge, we introduce Box2Boundary, a novel approach using box supervision, in conjunction with the segment anything model (SAM), to achieve cost-effective rooftop delineation. Leveraging the tiny InternImage architecture for enhanced feature extraction and using the dynamic scale training strategy to tackle scale variance, Box2Boundary demonstrates superior performance compared to alternative box-supervised methods. Extensive experiments on the Wuhan University Building Data Set validate our method's effectiveness, showcasing remarkable results with an average precision of 48.7%, outperforming DiscoBox, BoxInst, and Box2Mask by 22.0%, 11.3%, and 2.0%, respectively.

The PSMNet was trained using three datasets with both automated driving and aerial scenes. Two other distinctive sites were selected to assess the accuracy against LiDAR data. The study found inaccuracies in the PSMNet point clouds and suggested that SGM could potentially result in a better outcome. However, for flat slab or ground surface, its root-mean-square error is better than SGM. The analysis showed that the SGM analyses favorably remove points on vertical surfaces due to occlusion, while PSMNet incorrectly extrapolate them with slopes. Furthermore, the assessment identified the potential to improve PSMNet by using more or in-distribution training dataset for test (unseen) areas."
A Comparative Study of Deep Learning Methods for Automated Road Network Extraction from High-Spatial-Resolution Remotely Sensed Imagery,"Zhou, Haochen; He, Hongjie; Xu, Linlin; Ma, Lingfei; Zhang, Dedong; Chen, Nan; Chapman, Michael A.; Li, Jonathan",pp. 163-174(12),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000003/art00011;jsessionid=1n8bpies1an5q.x-ic-live-02,"Road network data are crucial for various applications, such as road network planning, traffic control, map navigation, autonomous driving, and smart city construction. Automated road network extraction from high-spatial-resolution remotely sensed imagery has shown promise in road network data construction. In recent years, the advent of deep learning algorithms has pushed road network extraction towards auto - mation, achieving very high accuracy. However, the latest deep learning models are often less applied in the field of road network extraction and lack comparative experiments for guidance. Therefore, this research selected three recent deep learning algorithms, including dense prediction transformer (DPT), SegFormer, SEgmentation TRansformer (SETR), and the classic model fully convolutional network-8s (FCN-8s) for a comparative study. Additionally, this research paper compares three different decoder structures within the SETR model (SETR_naive, SETR_mla, SETR_pup) to investigate the effect of different decoders on the road network extraction task. The experiment is conducted on three commonly used datasets: the DeepGlobe Dataset, the Massachusetts Dataset, and Road Datasets in Complex Mountain Environments (RDCME). The DPT model outperforms other models on the Massachusetts dataset with superior reliability, achieving a high accuracy of 96.31% and excelling with a precision of 81.78% and recall of 32.50%, leading to an F1 score of 46.51%. While SegFormer has a slightly higher F1 score, DPT's precision is particularly valuable for minimizing false positives, making it the most balanced and reliable choice. Similarly, for the DeepGlobe Dataset, DPT achieves an accuracy of 96.76%, precision of 66.12%, recall of 41.37%, and F1 score of 50.89%, and for RDCME, DPT achieves an accuracy of 98.94%, precision of 99.07%, recall of 99.84%, and F1 score of 99.46%, confirming its consistent performance across datasets.

With prior information, the Bayesian sample consensus (BaySAC) algorithm can efficiently derive the correct parameters and compensate for the deficiencies of the RANSAC algorithm. This study proposes an improved BaySAC vanish - ing point detection algorithm, which uses a linear grouping strategy to enhance the distribution of inliers across groups and accelerate convergence. In the continuous frame vanishing point tracking problem, the detection result of the previous frame is employed as a priori infor - mation for the subsequent frames, facilitating efficient convergence for vanishing point detection and tracking in videos.

Results indicate an over-all fire incidence detection accuracy of 62.3% with a KHAT value of 0.59. Moreover, a regular trend in intra-annual behavior in fire incidences with peaks during the hot and dry period of the year was observed and a large year-to-year variability in fire regimes with no significant trends over time could be noticed. The approach and results are discussed in detail along with the future perspective."

To address the challenge, we propose a light-weight ship object detection algorithm, adaptive layered multi-scale You Only Look Once version 8 (ALM-YOLOv8), based on multi-scale perception and feature enhancement. To enhance the model's perception of contextual information in complex backgrounds, a multi-scale channel fusion module is constructed to extract features of various scales. To enhance the extracted features, a small-object detection layer and a dynamic channel attention convolution that assigns dynamic weights are proposed. Additionally, this study embeds the large separable kernel attention mechanism into the original network, which lightens the model.

This research investigates the landslide in the Kunming transmission corridor using 79 Sentinel-1A SAR images from July 2020 to October 2021. Using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) methods, deformation changes before the landslide are analyzed. Factors like precipitation, lithology, and vegetation coverage demonstrate a correlation with landslide occurrence. Seasonal variations in deformation were related to precipitation. The landslide's primary causes are attributed to precipitation, carbonate karstification, and vegetation coverage. Ultimately, this research establishes a correlation between deformation changes and influencing factors in the Kunming transmission corridor, contributing to a deeper understanding of landslide evolution and ensuring the corridor's security for sustainable electricity supply and economic development."

Then, block scales matching the largest AP values of diverse objects are determined based on statistical results of the AP  values of the diverse object at different block scales. Finally, object-detection results at block scales matching the largest AP values of diverse objects are fused by the non-maximum  suppression algorithm to achieve large-scale HRSI object-detection results. Experimental findings reveal that the proposed method is better than any single block-scale object-detection  method, resulting in satisfactory large-scale HRSI object-detection results."

It facilitates downstream applications such as pan sharpening, change detection, and classification. However, image fusion solutions are highly disparate to various remote sensing problems and are often narrowly defined in existing reviews as topical applications (e. g., pan sharpening). Theoretically, image fusion can be applied to any gridded data through pixel-level operations; thus, we expand its scope by comprehensively surveying relevant works. We develop a simple taxonomy for many-to-one and many-to-many image fusion, defining it as a mapping problem turning one or multiple images into another set based on desired coherence. Furthermore, we provide a meta-analysis to cover 10,420 peer-reviewed papers from the 1980s to 2023 studying various types of image fusion and their applications.

Specifically, we adopt rotatable bounding boxes to predict the targets, and a novel rectangular rotation-invariant coordinate convolution (RRICC) is proposed to extract the feature, which can determine more accurately the convolutional sampling location of the vehicles. The adaptive thresholding denoising module (ATDM) is designed to suppress background clutter.

With reference data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Cropland Data Layer, we developed a spectral library of the crops and classified them using three machine learning algorithms (support vector machines [SVM], random forest [RF], and spectral angle mapper [SAM]) and two philosophies: 1. Full spectral analysis (FSA) and 2. Optimal hyperspectral narrowband (OHNB) analysis. For FSA, we used 59 DESIS four-bin product bands and 207 of 238 PRISMA bands. For OHNB analysis, 9 DESIS and 16 PRISMA nonredundant OHNBs for studying crops were selected. FSA achieved only 1% to 3% higher accuracies relative to OHNB analysis in most cases. SVM provided the best results, closely followed by RF. Using both DESIS and PRISMA image OHNBs in SVM for classification led to higher accuracy than using either image alone, with an overall accuracy of 99%, producer’s accuracies of 94% to 100%, and user???s accuracies of 95% to 100%."

We propose a variable-iterative fully convolutional neural network (VIFCNN) for sparse unmixing, combining the characteristics of these two networks. Under the model-driven iterative framework guided by sparse unmixing by variable splitting and augmented lagrangian (SUnSAL), a data-driven spatial-spectral feature learning module and a spatial information updating module are introduced to enhance the learning of data information. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets show that VIFCNN significantly outperforms several traditional unmixing methods and two deep learning-based methods.

To alleviate these problems, a teacher-student prototype enhancement network is proposed for a few-shot remote sensing scene classification. Instead of introducing an attentional mechanism in mainstream studies, a prototype enhancement module is recommended to adaptively select high-confidence query samples, which can enhance the support prototype representations to emphasize intraclass and interclass relationships. The construction of a few-shot teacher model generates more discriminative predictive representations with inputs from many labeled samples, thus providing a strong supervisory signal to the student model and encouraging the network to achieve accurate classification with a limited number of labeled samples. Extensive experiments of four public datasets, including NWPU-remote sens ing image scene classification (NWPU-RESISC45), aerial image dataset (AID), UC Merced, and WHU-RS19, demonstrate that this method achieves superior competitive performance than the state-of-the-art methods on five-way, one-shot, and five-shot classifications."

In this study, a point cloud semantic segmentation network based on RandLA-Net with multi-scale local feature aggregation and adaptive fusion is proposed. The designed structure can reduce computational complexity and accurately express local features. The mean intersection-over-union is improved by 1.1% on the SemanticKITTI data set with an inference speed of nine frames per second, while the mean intersection-over-union is improved by 0.9% on the S3DIS data set, compared with RandLA-Net.

It is well known and mathematically proven that additional parameters (APs) can compensate image distortions and remaining error sources by a rigorous photogrammetric bundle-block adjustment. Thus, kernel functions based on orthogonal wavelets (e. g., asymmetric Daubechies wave- lets, least asymmetric Daubechies wavelets, Battle-Lemarié wavelets, Meyer wavelets) are used to build the wavelets-based family of APs for self-calibrating digital frame cameras. These new APs are called wavelet APs. Its applications in rigorous tests are accomplished by using aerial images taken by an airborne digital mapping camera in situ and practical calibrations.

Due to the amount of time and high cost of monitoring and identifying asphalt pavement aging, many current studies focus on satellite remote sensing methods. In this paper, some methods and technologies for monitoring asphalt pavement degradation by optical satellite remote sensing are introduced as a literature review. Many researchers have developed spectrum libraries based on the actual aging of asphalt pavements, and it is possible to construct pavement health indices based on spectrum changes. Some indexes can extract different aging degrees of asphalt pavement from optical satellite images. Of course, current research can only preliminarily reflect the aging phenomenon of asphalt pavement and cannot accurately describe the distress characteristics of asphalt pavement. Future research needs to further strengthen mechanism research, develop higher resolution images, improve image processing technology, and adopt multi-means fusion analysis methods."
Mapping Winter Wheat Using Ensemble‐Based Positive Unlabeled Learning Approach,"Wang, Hanxiang; Yu, Fan; Xie, Junwei; Wan, Huawei; Zheng, Haotian",pp. 483-491(9),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2024/00000090/00000008/art00008;jsessionid=fno2r4o59q0tt.x-ic-live-03,"High‐resolution remote sensing images can support machine learning methods to achieve remarkable results in agricultural monitoring. However, traditional supervised learning methods require pre-labeled training data and are unsuitable for non-fully labeled areas. Positive and Unlabeled Learning (PUL), can deal with unlabeled data. A loss function PU-Loss was proposed in this study to directly optimize the PUL evaluation metric and to address the data imbalance problem caused by unlabeled positive samples. Moreover, a hybrid normalization module Batch Instance-Layer Normalization was proposed to perform multiple normalization methods based on the resolution size and to improve the model performance further. A real‐world positive and unlabeled winter wheat data set was used to evaluate the proposed method, which outperformed widely used models such as U‐Net, DeepLabv3+, and DA‐Net. The results demonstrated the potential of PUL for winter wheat identification in remote sensing images."

In this study, a method for detecting building shadows in GF‐2 images based on improved quick shift was proposed. First, six feature variables were constructed: first principal component (PC1), brightness component (I), normalized difference shadow index (NDSI), morphological shadow index (MSI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Then, the image was segmented to obtain homogeneous objects, which were then classified using a random forest model. Two improvements were added to the quick shift algorithm: using PC1, I, and MSI as input data instead of RGB images; and adding Canny edge constraints. Validation in six research areas yields Kappa coefficients of 0.928, 0.896, 0.89, 0.913, 0.879, and 0.909, confirming method feasibility. In addition, comparative experiments demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness across different land cover types while mitigating the segmentation scale effect."

Diverse geological processes generate irregular alteration patterns with diverse spectral characteristics in mineral deposits. Applying remotely sensed hyperspectral images (HSIs) is an appealing technology for geologic surveyors to generate alteration maps. Conventional methods mainly use shallow spectral absorption features to discriminate minerals and cannot extract their important spectral information. Deep neural networks with nonlinear layers can evoke the deep spectral and spatial information of HSIs. Deep learning-based methods include fully connected neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and hybrid convolutional networks like mixed convolution neural network and covariance pooling (MCNN‐CP) algorithms. However, each has its advantages and limitations. To significantly avoid losing important spectral features, we proposed a new method by fusing a one‐dimensional convolutional neural network (1D‐CNN) with MCNN‐CP (1D‐MCNN‐CP), achieving an overall accuracy (97.44%) of mineral mapping from PRISMA HSIs. This research deduced that 1D‐MCNN‐CP improved performance and reduced misclassification errors among minerals sharing similar spectral features."

Multispectral images have high spatial resolution but low spectral resolution. Hyperspectral images have high spectral resolution but low spatial resolution. This study proposes a residual learning and attention-based parallel network based on residual network and channel attention. The network performs image fusion of a high spatial resolution multispectral image and a low spatial resolution hyperspectral image. The network training and fusion experiments are conducted on four public benchmark data sets to show the effectiveness of the proposed model. The fusion performance is compared with classical signal processing-based image fusion techniques. Four image metrics are used for the quantitative evaluation of the fused images. The proposed network improved fusion ability by reducing the root mean square error and relative dimensionless global error in synthesis and increased the peak signal-to-noise ratio when compared to other state-of-the-art models.

Dense photogrammetrically derived point clouds are created and are facilitated to extract land cover data using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier in this study. We test our approach using point clouds derived from 1-cm stereo imagery of plots in the Alaska North Slope region and compare the results to field observations. The results show that the overall accuracy of six land cover classes (bare soil, shrub, grass, forb/herb, rock, and litter) is 96.8% from classified patches. Shrub had the highest accuracy (>99%) and forb/herb achieved the lowest (<48%). This study reveals that the approach could be used as reference data to check field observations in remote areas."

The goal is to extract open water in vegetation, clouds, terrain shadows, and other land cover backgrounds from medium-resolution remote sensing images. The average overall accuracy and average kappa coefficient of the classification were verified to be 0.91 and 0.81, respectively.

Furthermore, we use an asymmetric multi-scale fusion module and dual-path feature aggregation module to enhance feature extraction and fusion. Finally, a decoder is constructed to enable progressive up-sampling. Experimental results on the Potsdam data set and the Gaofen image data set (GID) demonstrate that DPFANet achieves overall accuracy of 92.2% and 89.3%, respectively. The FLOPs are 6.72 giga and the number of parameters is 2.067 million."

In the event of insulator explosions on power grid towers, these insulators may detach, presenting potential safety risks to transmission lines. The identification of such failures relies on the examination of images captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, accurately detecting insulator defects remains challenging, particularly when dealing with variations in size. Existing methods exhibit limited accuracy in detecting small objects. In this paper, we propose a novel detection method that incorporates the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) as an attention mechanism into the backbone of the ""you only look once"" version 5 (YOLOv5) model. Additionally, we integrate a residual structure into the model to learn additional information and features related to insulators, thereby enhancing detection efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieved F1 scores of 0.87 for insulator detection and 0.89 for insulator defect detection. The improved YOLOv5 network shows promise in detecting insulators and their defects in UAV images."

Seagrass is vital for many species in the lagoon, but nutrient overloading, algal blooms, boating, manatee grazing, and other factors have led to its loss. To understand this decline, a deep neural network analyzed Landsat imagery from 2000 to 2020. Results showed significant seagrass loss post-2013, coinciding with the 2011–2013 super algal bloom. Seagrass abundance varied annually, with the model performing best in years with higher seagrass coverage. While the deep learning method successfully identified seagrass, it also revealed that recent seagrass coverage is almost non-existent. This monitoring approach could aid in ecosystem recovery if coupled with appropriate policies for Mosquito Lagoon's restoration."

Our experimental findings from PS-InSAR and SBAS-InSAR revealed that the deformation rates in the study region ranged between –50 to 20 mm/year and –30 to 10 mm/year, respectively. Furthermore, the deformation rates of the same points, as determined by these methods, exhibited a significant increase prior to the event. We also investigated the causal relationship between rainfall and landslide events, demonstrating that deformation rates correlate with changes in rainfall, albeit with a time lag. Therefore, using time-series InSAR for landslide monitoring in Xinmo Village is a viable approach."

This study thus examines underwater photogrammetry methods using a widely recognized action camera as a reference and compares it with another camera of similar characteristics as a potential alternative. For a comprehensive temporal analysis in underwater studies, both cameras were used to capture photographic and video imagery, and the resulting 3D point clouds were compared. Comparison criteria included data collection and processing times, point cloud densities, cloud-to-cloud analysis, and assessments of surface density and roughness.

This technique focuses on approximating returns for empty pulses that hit spots near abrupt slope changes on building and ground surfaces. The proposed methodology is validated through experiments using a lidar data set from downtown Dublin, Ireland. The collected data contained numerous gaps associated with wet surfaces, as well as missing returns on vertical and oblique surfaces."

The recommendations presented in this article enable reliable estimates of accuracy and reliable predicted accuracies, both of which are critical to many geolocation-based applications. The recommendations associated with predicted accuracy are also relatively new and innovative."
A Keyframe Extraction Approach for 3D Videogrammetry Based on Baseline Constraints,"Liu, Xinyi; Hu, Qingwu; Huang, Xianfeng",pp. 171-180(10),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2024/00000090/00000003/art00008;jsessionid=20ua5qvgtkua4.x-ic-live-02,"In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the extraction of high-quality frames to enhance the fidelity of videogrammetry by combining fuzzy frames removal and baseline constraints. We first implement a gradient-based mutual information method to filter out low-quality frames while preserving the integrity of the videos. After frame pose estimation, the geometric properties of the baseline are constrained by three aspects to extract the keyframes: quality of relative orientation, baseline direction, and base to distance ratio. The three-dimensional model is then reconstructed based on these extracted keyframes. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach maintains a strong robustness throughout the aerial triangulation, leading to high levels of reconstruction precision across diverse video scenarios. Compared to other methods, this paper improves the reconstruction accuracy by more than 0.2 mm while simultaneously maintaining the completeness."
Extraction of Terraces in Hilly Areas from Remote Sensing Images Using DEM and Improved U-Net,"Peng, Fengcan; Peng, Qiuzhi; Chen, Di; Lu, Jiating; Song, Yufei",pp. 181-188(8),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2024/00000090/00000003/art00009;jsessionid=20ua5qvgtkua4.x-ic-live-02,"To extract terraced fields in hilly areas on a large scale in an automated and high-precision manner, this paper proposes a terrace extraction method that combines the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Sentinel-2 imagery, and the improved U-Net semantic segmentation model. The U-Net model is modified by introducing Attention Gate modules into its decoding modules to suppress the interference of redundant features and adding Dropout and Batch Normalization layers to improve training speed, robustness, and fitting ability. In addition, the DEM band is combined with the red, green, and blue bands of the remote sensing images to make full use of terrain information. The experimental results show that the Precision, Recall, F1 score, and Mean Intersection over Union of the proposed method for terrace extraction are improved to other mainstream advanced methods, and the internal information of the terraces extracted is more complete, with fewer false positive and false negative results."

The main aim of this article was to elucidate the necessity of spatiotemporal WQ monitoring of the shrinking Lake Burdur in Türkiye by examining the relation between field and satellite data with a state-of-the-art machine learning- based regression algorithm. This study focuses on detection of algal blooms and WQ parameters, which are chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and suspended solids (SS). Furthermore, this study leverages the advantage of geographic position of Lake Burdur, located at the overlap of two Sentinel-2 frames, which enables the acquisition of satellite images at a temporal resolution of 2–3 days. The findings enrich the understanding of the lake's dynamic structure by rapidly monitoring the occurrence of algal blooms. High accuracies were achieved for Chl-a (R-squared: 0.93) and SS (R-squared: 0.94) detection."

The reason for undertaking this topic is the lack of such studies for inland water bodies. The results will contribute to expanding and supplementing the knowledge on the assessment of the sight-aesthetic attractiveness of landscapes and fill gaps in knowledge about the underwater landscapes of lakes. The questionnaire survey implemented the direct comparison method described by Kendall (Kendall, M. G. 1970.Rank Correlation Methods. Charles Griffin and Co: Glasgow, Scotland). According to respondents, animals and submerged anthropogenic elements are the most visually attractive in an aquatic environment The results obtained are the reason for conducting further research and developing the methodology for the assessment of the sight-aesthetic value of inland bodies of water based on the experience of terrestrial landscape researchers."

Within-season predictions for 2018–2022 were then made to evaluate the perfor- mance of the proposed system by comparing it with the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) monthly forecasts and the fixed statistical data. The absolute percentage errors of the proposed system for predicting national-level yield and production were less than 5% for all simulation years as of day of year (DOY) 279. The prediction accuracy as of DOY 247 and DOY 279 were comparable to the USDA's forecasts. The proposed system would enable us to make a comprehensive understanding about overview of US corn and soybean crop condition by visualizing detail spatial pattern of good- or poor harvest regions on a within-season basis."
A Few-Shot Semi-Supervised Learning Method for Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification,"Zhu, Yuxuan; Li, Erzhu; Su, Zhigang; Liu, Wei; Samat, Alim; Liu, Yu",pp. 121-125(5),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2024/00000090/00000002/art00011;jsessionid=1jtduchlufh0s.x-ic-live-01,"Few-shot scene classification methods aim to obtain classification discriminative ability from few labeled samples and has recently seen substantial advancements. However, the current few-shot learning approaches still suffer from overfitting due to the scarcity of labeled samples. To this end, a few-shot semi-supervised method is proposed to address this issue. Specifically, semi-supervised learning method is used to increase target domain samples; then we train multiple classification models using the augmented samples. Finally, we perform decision fusion of the results obtained from the multiple models to accomplish the image classification task. According to the experiments conducted on two real few-shot remote sensing scene datasets, our proposed method achieves significantly higher accuracy (approximately 1.70% to 4.33%) compared to existing counterparts."
Terrain Complexity and Maximal Poisson-Disk Sampling-Based Digital Elevation Model Simplification,"Dong, Jingxian; Ming, Fan; Kabika, Twaha; Jiang, Jiayao; Zhang, Siyuan; Chervan, Aliaksandr; Natallia, Zhukouskaya; Hou, Wenguang",pp. 13-20(8),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2024/00000090/00000001/art00007;jsessionid=1snz5vpmi0ts1.x-ic-live-03,"With the rapid development of lidar, the accuracy and density of the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) point clouds have been continuously improved. However, in some applications, dense point cloud has no practical meaning. How to effectively sample from the dense points and maximize the preservation of terrain features is extremely important. This paper will propose a DEM sampling algorithm that utilizes terrain complexity and maximal Poisson-disk sampling to extract key feature points for adaptive DEM sampling. The algorithm estimates terrain complexity based on local terrain variation and prioritizes points with high complexity for sampling. The sampling radius is inversely proportional to terrain complexity, while ensuring that points within the radius of accepted samples are not considered new samples. This way makes more points of concern in the rugged regions. The results show that the proposed algorithm has higher global accuracy than the classic six sampling methods."
I2-FaçadeNet: An Illumination-invariant Façade Recognition Network Leveraging Sparsely Gated Mixture of Multi-color Space Experts for Aerial Oblique Imagery,"Huang, Shengzhi; Hu, Han; Zhu, Qing",pp. 21-31(11),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2024/00000090/00000001/art00008;jsessionid=1snz5vpmi0ts1.x-ic-live-03,"Façade image recognition under complex illumination conditions is crucial for various applications, including urban three-dimensional modeling and building identification. Existing methods relying solely on Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images are prone to texture ambiguity in complex illumination environments. Furthermore, façades display varying orientations and camera viewing angles, resulting in performance issues within the RGB color space. In this study, we introduce an illumination-invariant façade recognition network (I2-FaçadeNet) that leverages sparsely gated multi-color space experts for enhanced façade image recognition in challenging illumination environments. First, RGB façade images are converted into multi-color spaces to eliminate the ambiguous texture in complex illumination. Second, we train expert networks using separate channels of multi-color spaces. Finally, a sparsely gated mechanism is introduced to manage the expert networks, enabling dynamic activation of expert networks and the merging of results. Experimental evaluations leveraging both the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing benchmark data sets and the Shenzhen data sets reveal that our proposed I2-FaçadeNet surpasses various depths of ResNet in façade recognition under complex illumination conditions. Specifically, the classification accuracy for poorly illuminated façades in Zurich improves by nearly 8%, while the accuracy for over-illuminated areas in Shenzhen increases by approximately 3%. Moreover, ablation studies conducted on façade images with complex illumination indicate that compared to traditional RGB-based ResNet, the proposed network achieves an accuracy improvement of 3% to 4% up to 100% for overexposed images and an accuracy improvement of 3% to 10% for underexposed images."
Development of Soil-Suppressed Impervious Surface Area Index for Automatic Urban Mapping,"Javed, Akib; Shao, Zhenfeng; Ara, Iffat; Ahmad, Muhammad Nasar; Huq, Md.Enamul; Saleem, Nayyer; Karim, Fazlul",pp. 33-43(11),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2024/00000090/00000001/art00009;jsessionid=1snz5vpmi0ts1.x-ic-live-03,"Expanding urban impervious surface area (ISA) mapping is crucial to sustainable development, urban planning, and environmental studies. Multispectral ISA mapping is challenging because of the mixed-pixel problems with bare soil. This study presents a novel approach using spectral and temporal information to develop a Soil-Suppressed Impervious Surface Area Index (SISAI) using the Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) data set, which reduces the soil but enhances the ISA signature. This study mapped the top 12 populated megacities using SISAI and achieved an over-all accuracy of 0.87 with an F1-score of 0.85. It also achieved a higher Spatial Dissimilarity Index between the ISA and bare soil. However, it is limited by bare gray soil and shadows of clouds and hills. SISAI encourages urban dynamics and inter-urban compari- son studies owing to its automatic and unsupervised methodology."
Dual-branch Branch Networks Based on Contrastive Learning for Long-Tailed Remote Sensing,"Zhang, Lei; Peng, Lijia; Xia, Pengfei; Wei, Chuyuan; Yang, Chengwei; Zhang, Yanyan",pp. 45-53(9),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2024/00000090/00000001/art00010;jsessionid=1snz5vpmi0ts1.x-ic-live-03,"Deep learning has been widely used in remote sensing image classification and achieves many excellent results. These methods are all based on relatively balanced data sets. However, in real-world scenarios, many data sets belong to the long-tailed distribution, resulting in poor performance. In view of the good performance of contrastive learning in long-tailed image classification, a new dual-branch fusion learning classification model is proposed to fuse the discriminative features of remote sensing images with spatial data, making full use of valuable image representation information in imbalance data. This paper also presents a hybrid loss, which solves the problem of poor discrimination of extracted features caused by large intra-class variation and inter-class ambiguity. Extended experiments on three long-tailed remote sensing image classification data sets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed dual-branch model based on contrastive learning in long-tailed image classification."
Comparison of 3D Point Cloud Completion Networks for High Altitude Lidar Scans of Buildings,"Kulawiak, Marek",pp. 55-64(10),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2024/00000090/00000001/art00011;jsessionid=1snz5vpmi0ts1.x-ic-live-03,"High altitude lidar scans allow for rapid acquisition of big spatial data representing entire city blocks. Unfortunately, the raw point clouds acquired by this method are largely incomplete due to object occlusions and restrictions in scanning angles and sensor resolution, which can negatively affect the obtained results. In recent years, many new solutions for 3D point cloud completion have been created and tested on various objects; however, the application of these methods to high-altitude lidar point clouds of buildings has not been properly investigated yet. In the above context, this paper presents the results of applying several state-of-the-art point cloud completion networks to various building exteriors acquired by simulated airborne laser scanning. Moreover, the output point clouds generated from partial data are compared with complete ground-truth point clouds. The performed tests show that the SeedFormer network trained on the ShapeNet-55 data set provides promising shape completion results."
