Global Multi-Scale Fusion Self-Calibration Network for Remote Sensing Object Detection,"Chen, Yan; Shi, Xinlu; Wang, Xiaofeng; Gu, Qi; Zhang, Chen; Xu, Lixiang; Zhan, Shian; Yu, Wenle",pp. 607-621(15),N/A,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000010/art00007;jsessionid=4qh1a391gmc8g.x-ic-live-03,"Applications of remote sensing images in both defense and civilian sectors have spurred substantial research interest. In the field of remote sensing, object detection confronts challenges such as complex backgrounds, scale diversity, and the presence of dense small objects. To address these issues, we propose an improved deep learning-based model, the Global Multi-scale Fusion Self-calibration Network, which is expected to contribute to alleviating the challenges. It consists of three main components: the hierarchical feature aggregation backbone, which uses improved modules such as the receptive field context-aware feature extraction module, the global information acquisition module, and the simple parameter-free attention module to extract key features and minimize the background interference. To couple multi-scale features, we enhanced the fusing component and designed the multi-scale enhanced pyramid structure integrating the proposed new modules. During the detection phase, especially when focusing on small object detection, we designed a novel convolutional attention feature fusion head. This head is constructed to integrate local and global branches for feature extraction by leveraging channel shuffling and multi-head attention mechanisms for efficient and accurate detection. Experiments on the Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images (DIOR), Northwestern Polytechnical University Very High-Resolution‐10 (NWPU VHR‐10), remote sensing object detection (RSOD), and DOTAv1.0 data sets show that our method achieves mAP50(mean average precision at 50% intersection over union) of 69.7%, 91.3%, 94.2%, and 70.0%, respectively, outperforming existing comparative methods. The proposed network is expected to provide new perspectives for remote sensing tasks and possible solutions for relevant applications in the image domain."
MRTD-Based Effective Range Analysis of Airborne Infrared Imaging Systems for Ship Detection: Optimization of the Calculation for Operational Range Through an Improved MRTD Model,"Yan, Peng; Tian, Yuyang; Ling, Xiao; Zhu, Kaikai; Sheng, Qinghong; Wang, Bo; Li, Jun; Liu, Xiang; Xu, Xiao",pp. 623-630(8),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000010/art00010;jsessionid=4qh1a391gmc8g.x-ic-live-03,"When the airborne infrared imaging system detects ships, significant variations in environmental temperature are often observed. In the existing calculation models for the operating range, the factor of environmental temperature has not been taken into account. However, when the environmental temperature changes, it will affect the variation of the minimum resolvable temperature difference (MRTD) of the system, resulting in a relatively large deviation in the prediction of the operating range of the airborne infrared imaging system. To address this crucial technical challenge, this study systematically established the relationship formula of the MRTD under different temperatures. By integrating with the improved theoretical model of MRTD, a calculation method for the operating range that takes environmental temperature into consideration was developed to accurately determine the operating range of the airborne infrared imaging system. Comparative experimental studies focusing on ships show that, compared with traditional methods, the prediction deviation of the proposed method is significantly reduced, with an average reduction of 10.1%."
Convolutional Neural Networks for Land Use and Land Cover Multi-class Maps from Historical Aerial Photographs,"Kostrzewa, Adam",pp. 631-645(15),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000010/art00011;jsessionid=4qh1a391gmc8g.x-ic-live-03,"Historical maps that describe past land use and land cover (LULC) forms can be a precious source of information in many scientific fields studying long-term spatial and temporal changes in the landscape. Such repositories were created manually in small areas in the past, which was a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. Recently, there has been a growing tendency to use machine learning models for this purpose, along with deep learning methods. However, having a massive amount of labeled data is necessary for these methods to train the networks. Training data are often manually labeled, posing a significant challenge and limiting the automation of these methods. This article presents a method that uses topographic databases to extract complex multi-class maps representing LULC from historical aerial photographs, eliminating the time-consuming data labeling step. The method uses transfer learning with a pretrained model on 2020 and 2014 data and attempts to reconstruct LULC types with the same convolutional neural network (CNN) network on archived images from 2006. The experiment covered 488 km2and included seven LULC classes. The method was tested using different CNN architectures (U-Net, Pyramid Scene Parsing Network [PSPNet], and LinkNet) with backbones (ResNeXt+SE, EfficientNet, and Inception). The PSPNet‐EfficientNet‐b7 network model achieved the best results, with 90% overall accuracy for predicting LULC classes based on the 2006 archived aerial images."
Thirty Years of the U.S. National Land Cover Database: Impacts and Future Direction,"Sohl, Terry; Jin, Suming; Dewitz, Jon; Wickham, James; Brown, Jesslyn; Stehman, Stephen; Herold, Nathaniel; Schleeweis, Karen; Tollerud, Heather; Deering, Carol",pp. 647-659(13),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000010/art00013;jsessionid=4qh1a391gmc8g.x-ic-live-03,"The National Land Cover Database (NLCD), developed through the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium, was initiated 30 years ago and has continually provided critical, Landsat-based landcover and land-change information for the United States. Originally launched to address the lack of national-scale, moderate-resolution land-cover data, NLCD has evolved from the pioneering 1992 dataset into a comprehensive, annually updated product suite. Key innovations include the introduction of impervious surface mapping, forest canopy mapping, standardized Landsat mosaics, national-scale accuracy assessments, continual evolution of deep learning and artificial intelligence methodologies, and a transition toward operational, change-focused monitoring. The NLCD has become an essential resource for scientific research, land management, and policy development, with extensive adoption across federal, state, and local agencies; academia; and the private sector. The NLCD data underpin a wide array of applications, including biodiversity conservation, urban planning, hydrology, human health studies, and natural hazard assessment. As new global and high-resolution commercial land-cover products emerge, the NLCD continues to distinguish itself through its temporal depth, federal backing, and thematic consistency. Moving forward, the NLCD will maintain its niche as the leading, moderate-resolution, long-term land-cover and land-change dataset for the United States, ensuring continued support for broad national applications while complementing higher-resolution and global-mapping efforts."
Crack Parameter Determination Based on Multiple-Window Matching Strategy and Crack Grid Geometry Analysis,"Tong, Xiaohua; Gao, Sa; Ye, Zhen; Chen, Peng; Liu, Shijie; Xie, Huan; Liu, Xianglei; Hong, Zhonghua; Zhang, Dezhi; Yang, Jun; Song, Yanfeng; Lv, Hongpeng; Cao, Dong",pp. 551-562(12),N/A,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000009/art00008;jsessionid=28tss63a2s31t.x-ic-live-01,"Accurate deformation measurement of building materials has consistently been a focal point of research within the field of material testing. This paper proposes a robust 3D crack parameter estimation approach to measure the crack propagation characteristics of concrete pillars under compression testing. Through the use of an improved multiple-window matching strategy and other advanced image processing algorithms, the precise positional information of speckle target points can be calculated in speckle image sequences. 3D point cloud data and full-field deformation of target points on the concrete pillar surface can be further calculated through photogrammetric analysis and spatiotemporal analysis, respectively. Finally, a robust crack estimation algorithm based on grid geometry analysis is proposed to extract accurate crack parameters in the presence of complex speckle texture interference. To verify the superiority and reliability of the proposed approach, both a simulation test and an empirical test were conducted. The experimental results, including positional comparisons with previous matching strategies and displacement comparisons with third-party equipment, corroborate the effectiveness of our method."
LFSA‐YOLOv7: A Novel Method for Ship Detection in Remote Sensing Images with Complex Backgrounds,"Gu, Heng; Li, Wei; Zhang, Linlin; Meng, Qingyan; Wei, Lianhuan; Wu, Hantian; Ma, Jian",pp. 563-571(9),N/A,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000009/art00009;jsessionid=28tss63a2s31t.x-ic-live-01,"Ship target detection is a critical component for marine environmental monitoring and the protection of maritime rights and interests. However, existing methods for ship detection in remote sensing imagery often face challenges such as false positives and missed detections, particularly in the presence of complex backgrounds and multi-scale targets. To address these issues, we propose a novel method called LFSA‐YOLOv7, (LDConv {Linear Deformable Convolution}; SPPFCSPC‐G {Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fast Cross Stage Partial Channel ‐ Group}, SimAM{Simple Attention Module}, and Alpha‐CoIoU {Alpha‐Coordinate Point Orienta tion ‐ Intersection over Union}) which is designed to enhance the accuracy and robustness of ship detection in complex backgrounds: (a) a novel network architecture (LDConv + SPPFCSPC‐G + SimAM) to enhance the model’s ship detection capabilities, and (b) a novel Alpha‐CoIoU loss function to improve the model’s ship localization accuracy. To evaluate the performance of our algorithm in complex backgrounds, we have developed a novel ship classification detection (SCD) data set and conducted comprehensive experiments. Furthermore, we have validated the generalization of our algorithm across various remote sensing ship data sets. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms previous techniques, exhibiting strong generalization and robustness, making it effectively suitable for ship detection in complex backgrounds. The SCD data set and code will be available at https://github.com/wionn/LFSA-YOLOv7.git."
Lightweight and Accurate Video Synthetic Aperture Radar Target Detection Network,"Ma, Huilian; Li, Yinwei; Li, Weisong; Zhu, Yiming",pp. 573-581(9),N/A,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000009/art00011;jsessionid=28tss63a2s31t.x-ic-live-01,"Video synthetic aperture radar (SAR) target detection has seen rapid development in recent years, but current methods generally suffer from high computational complexity as well as frequent false alarms and missed alarms. Additionally, in video SAR scenarios, small targets become more difficult to identify due to low resolution and complex backgrounds. Recently, leveraging shadows for video SAR moving target detection has proven advantageous as it provides accurate location information and additional boundary details. To address the challenges of target detection in video SAR caused by low resolution and complex backgrounds, as well as the high computational cost of current methods, this paper proposes a lightweight algorithm for video SAR shadow detection based on the YOLOv5 architecture, named Lavs-DeNet. First, a lightweight feature extraction backbone network combining both global and local information called CGLLNet is proposed. This backbone improves the detection performance by mitigating false alarms and missed alarms caused by defocus in video SAR images. Next, a slanted ladder bidirectional feature pyramid network (SL‐BiFPN) is designed. By using tilted upsampling with multiple stacked layers, this network efficiently extracts multi-scale features, further reducing missed alarms. Finally, a lightweight information interaction module (LII‐C3) has been developed, significantly reducing computational complexity. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments were conducted using the data set released by Sandia National Laboratories. The experimental results show that the proposed Lavs-DeNet can achieve 97.88% detection accuracy, requiring only 21.02G floating points and 0.88M parameters, which is superior to the current classical video SAR target detection networks."
Hierarchical Multi-Scale Cross Interaction Network for Enhanced Hyperspectral Image Classification,"Feng, Yuting; Yang, Lina; Wu, Thomas; Huang, Youju",pp. 495-507(13),N/A,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000008/art00010;jsessionid=pmt9655racwv.x-ic-live-02,"The significance of hyperspectral image classification lies in its ability to discern subtle differences between materials, making it essential in fields such as agriculture, mineral exploration, and urban planning. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer-based methods have become standard for hyperspectral imagery classification, with hybrid approaches gaining popularity. Yet, these methods often lack efficient interaction between the features extracted by CNNs and transformers. To address this, we propose the hierarchical multiscale cross interaction network (HMCI-Net), which leverages both CNNs and transformers to enhance classification accuracy. The CNN branch extracts local spatial-spectral features, and the transformer branch captures global spectral information, allowing the network to model long-range dependencies and complex correlations. Additionally, HMCI-Net incorporates a hierarchical multi-scale feature extraction module and a multi-view feature fusion module, further improving its ability to extract fine-grained, multi-perspective features. Extensive experiments on four benchmark hyperspectral data sets—Indian Pines, Pavia University, WHU-Hi-LongKou, and Houston2013—demonstrate that HMCI-Net outperforms existing methods, achieving an average improvement of 6.24% in average accuracy, 6.14% in kappa coefficient, and 5.55% in overall accuracy. Specifically, HMCI-Net achieves significant gains, with overall accuracy higher by 8.86%, 4.34%, 4.44%, and 4.42% on Indian Pines, Pavia University, WHU-HiLongKou, and Houston2013, respectively. Similarly, average accuracy is higher by 10.57%, 4.94%, 5.65%, and 4.81% for Indian Pines, Pavia University, WHU-Hi-LongKou, and Houston2013, respectively; kappa coefficient is higher by 10.39%, 4.88%, 4.70%, and 4.60%, respectively, on these data sets.

Efficient Coral Survey Using Aerial Remote Sensing and Multi-modal Segmentation for Large-Scale Ecological Assessment,"Qin, Jiangying; Li, Ming; Armin, Gruen; Gong, Jianya; Zhong, Jiageng; Liao, Xuan",pp. 509-516(8),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000008/art00013;jsessionid=pmt9655racwv.x-ic-live-02,"Due to the ecological pressures of global warming and human activities in coastal regions, coral reef ecosystems, predominantly located in shallow marine areas, are facing severe threats to their survival. Scientists and governmental managers are eager to leverage novel aerial remote sensing technologies to address the challenges of acquiring accurate, comprehensive, and timely data on coral reef health, structural complexity, and spatial distribution. This study aims to tackle these challenges by using precise and accurate aerial remote sensing data to support the restoration and sustainable prosperity of coral reef systems. Specifically, this study develops and applies an efficient coral survey method based on aerial remote sensing. The method integrates aerial imagery and bathymetric lidar (light detection and ranging) point cloud data and uses advanced photogrammetric computer vision and deep learning algorithms. Using a state-of-the-art multi-modal neural network segmentation technique, the proposed method enables high-precision and intelligent identification of coral reefs, facilitating detailed habitat mapping. Furthermore, by accurately delineating the habitat range and geometric structures of reefs, this approach allows for precise measurements of coral biomass production and skeletal calcification. These metrics help assess coral reef structural complexity and their adaptability to environmental stressors, providing robust scientific data for conservation strategies and policy making. The use of advanced multi-modal aerial remote sensing data not only enhances monitoring reliability and accuracy but also offers a cost-effective and flexible tool for coral reef ecological mapping. This approach effectively addresses challenges encountered in coastal ecological surveys, particularly in areas where direct human access or boat entry is difficult."
On the Transferability of Semantic Segmentation for Very-High-Resolution Remote Sensing Data of Multi-City Environments,"Qin, Rongjun; Zhang, Guixiang; Tang, Yang",pp. 517-528(12),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000008/art00014;jsessionid=pmt9655racwv.x-ic-live-02,"Semantic segmentation of very-high-resolution remote sensing (RS) data is foundational for many RS applications in urban environments. Images from sources like Worldview-3/4 and Pleiades-Neo offer resolutions as high as 0.3 m, enabling a fine-grained understanding of urban structures. Recent deep learning‐based methods have significantly outperformed traditional approaches in RS semantic segmentation/classification tasks. However, they require large training data sets and often lack transferability due to highly disparate RS image content across different geographical regions. However, no comprehensive analysis exists on their transferability—i.e., to what extent a model trained on a source domain can be applied to a target domain in urban areas. This paper investigates the raw transferability of traditional and deep-learning models and the effectiveness of domain adaptation approaches in enhancing deep-learning model transferability (adapted transferability). Using five highly diverse RS data sets from different cities (6792 patches of 1024 × 1024 pixels each), we trained six models with and without three domain adaptation approaches to quantitatively analyze transferability between data sets. To facilitate easy assessment of model transferability, we developed a simple method to quantify transferability using spectral indices as a medium, demonstrating its effectiveness in evaluating model transferability at the target domain when labels are unavailable. Our experiments yield several important but underreported observations on raw and adapted transferability. Moreover, our proposed label-free transferability assessment method outperforms posterior model confidence and can guide model selection for urban studies globally. The models and datasets are publicly available on GitHub at: https://github.com/GDAOSU/Transferability-Remote-Sensing."
Combined Use of Satellite Observations and the RIM for Assessing Recovery from Natural Disasters,"Cao, Changyong; Wang, Wenhui; Bai, Yan; Shao, Xi; Uprety, Sirish; Qiu, Hong-Lie",pp. 407-417(11),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000007/art00010;jsessionid=xwsbjzfkisfo.x-ic-live-02,"In this study, we explore using satellite observations to assess community recovery from natural disasters such as fires and hurricanes, supplementing the Resilience Inference Model (RIM). The RIM model has been successfully used to quantify recoveries from hurricanes along the Gulf Coast, but it relies on long-term population changes over years or decades. Our approach integrates satellite observations to enhance recovery assessment with a shorter latency of weeks or months. Using fire, vegetation, and night light data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) with daily global observations, Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite/Advanced Baseline Imager, we quantitatively evaluate fire intensity, light outage, and urban greenness changes, along with subsequent recovery, focusing on the 2023 Maui fire and selected hurricane cases along the Gulf Coast. This approach complements the RIM model by introducing quantifiable physical parameters with shorter latency, particularly beneficial in areas where census data are either unavailable or unreliable."
Analysis of Landslide Susceptibility of the Darjeeling District Using a Frequency Ratio Model and Geographical Weighted Regression,"Sen, Suhel; Sarif, Md.Omar",pp. 419-432(14),N/A,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000007/art00012;jsessionid=xwsbjzfkisfo.x-ic-live-02,"India yearly experiences natural disasters such as floods, droughts, cyclones, and landslides, which not only disrupt but also significantly affect the socioeconomic activities of its people. Darjeeling, one of the most valuable districts of West Bengal, India, is located in the foothills of the mighty Himalayas. Landslides in Darjeeling, particularly during the monsoon season, severely affect the socioeconomic conditions of the local population. This research creates a landslide susceptibility map of Darjeeling using the frequency ratio model (FRM) and geographical weighted regression (GWR). The study considers 16 landslide-conditioning factors and 743 past landslide events, of which 70% are used for modeling and the remaining 30% are used for validation. The generated landslide susceptibility map categorizes the area into very low, low, moderate, high, and very high susceptibility zones. Results show that most of the study area falls within the high susceptibility zone, covering approximately 28.45% of the region. The study also reveals that the northern hilly regions of the district are more prone to landslides compared with the southern part, based on FRM and GWR. The area under curve indicates that the model achieved a 74.7% success rate. The highest value of the landslide density index was found in areas classified as having very high landslide susceptibility. Therefore, considering the landslide susceptibility, implementation of effective management strategies is essential for ensuring the future development of the district."
Leadership in COVID-19: Mitigation Strategies across Top 30 Gross Domestic Product Countries,"Ozdenerol, Esra; Bingham-Byrne, Rebecca Michelle",pp. 433-442(10),N/A,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000007/art00014;jsessionid=xwsbjzfkisfo.x-ic-live-02,"This study analyzes COVID-19 response strategies in the top 30 gross domestic product countries from the first case until 30 September 2021, a period marked by increased vaccinations, the dominance of the Delta variant, and changing public health measures. We examined which mitigation efforts effectively reduced new cases and the viral reproduction rate. Vaccination policies, movement restrictions, and mask mandates were critical in reducing cases per million, while testing, public information, income support, and contact tracing were crucial for lowering the viral reproduction rate. Vaccination policies did not significantly affect the reproduction rate during implementation. The gender of leaders showed no significant effect on cases, deaths, or excess mortality, though female leaders generally implemented fewer isolation days and prioritized additional measures like movement restrictions and stay-at-home orders."
Lyme Disease Risk Map and Prioritizing Areas for Vaccine Deployment,"Bingham-Byrne, Rebecca Michelle; Ozdenerol",pp. 443-454(12),N/A,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000007/art00015;jsessionid=xwsbjzfkisfo.x-ic-live-02,"Disease surveillance, including risk modeling, is beneficial for infectious diseases. Risk prediction maps can be used to prioritize areas to deliver vaccines reducing disease transmission. For zoonotic infectious diseases such as Lyme disease, potential vaccine deployment areas include cost-effective places key to vectors, wildlife hosts, and humans. This paper uses machine-learning techniques to develop models to predict Lyme disease risk, then uses the critical variables within the models, as well those considered principal from previous literature, to create a Lyme disease risk map and to prioritize areas for wildlife vaccine deployment. It was found that highest disease risk is in the eastern United States, especially the upper Midwest and Northeast regions, which coincides with previous literature. The study found national parks and counties within these areas to prioritize wildlife vaccine deployment. Future work includes ground-truthing of the risk map and dispersal of vaccine to priority areas."
"Enhancing Residential Building Identification in a Coastal Texas City: An Integrated Framework Leveraging Remote Sensing, GIS, and Transfer Learning Techniques","Ye, Xinyue; Bai, Weishan; Huang, Xiao",pp. 455-462(8),N/A,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000007/art00016;jsessionid=xwsbjzfkisfo.x-ic-live-02,"Rapid urbanization and population growth have intensified the need for accurate and efficient identification of residential buildings in urban planning and disaster management. This paper presents a novel approach for identifying residential buildings by leveraging multiple source data and a transfer learning model, with a case study conducted in Galveston Island, Texas. We propose an integrated framework that combines very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery, lidar data, points of interest (POI) data, and GIS-based land use information to extract features of residential buildings. We fine-tune a pretrained deep learning model with our data sets to enhance the model’s adaptability and efficiency in detecting residential buildings in the study area. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high accuracy in identifying residential buildings, with overall accuracy of 85.6% in the case study. This study also offers valuable insights into the potential of combining multiple data sources and transfer learning techniques for improving residential building identification and other related tasks in urban remote sensing applications."
Spatiotemporal Continuous Shallow Water Bathymetry from a Kriged Kalman Filter,"Wang, Lei; Liu, Hongxing; Kang, Lei; Su, Haibin; Shu, Song; Wang, Jun",pp. 463-471(9),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000007/art00017;jsessionid=xwsbjzfkisfo.x-ic-live-02,"In GIScience, problems of missing data in space or time are nontrivial. We implemented a Kriged Kalman filter (KKF)‐based data interpolation and assimilation technique and tested it for mapping bathymetry at unsampled locations and times. This technique integrates the Kriging and Kalman filter computation frameworks to perform spatiotemporal data assimilation, which can produce spatially and temporally continuous bathymetric fields from samples that are scarce in space and time. The spatiotemporal bathymetric field over the estuary of the Yangtze River was mapped based on the four boat-based depth echo-sounding surveys conducted in 1982, 1997, 2002, and 2010. Our validation and verification analyses showed that the KKF assimilation model can predict bathymetry accurately and reliably at unsampled locations and times. This paper demonstrates that KKF is superior to traditional spatial interpolation methods because it informs the interpolator with the temporal component that also extends the prediction to the time domain. The experiments indicate that greater time intervals in conducting bathymetric surveys result in a more pronounced influence on the performance of KKF than the spatial sparsity of depth samples. The ability of space-time prediction of bathymetry allows underwater depth measurements to be accurately aligned with satellite images, which is essential for improving multispectral image inversion in bathymetry studies."
Texture-Semantic Point: Registration for Point Clouds of Porcelain Relics,"Ge, Xuming; Wu, Chengze; Chen, Min; Xu, Bo; Zhu, Qing; Hu, Han",pp. 347-360(14),N/A,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000006/art00012;jsessionid=5m1k2bq8fnd15.x-ic-live-03,"Point cloud models of porcelain are captured through the multi-registration of point clouds, which presents a challenging task. On the one hand, the smooth surface of porcelain lacks geometric feature variation, making it difficult to establish corresponding points. On the other hand, the overall geometric symmetry of most porcelain relics can easily lead to iterative calculations falling into the local minimum convergence trap. To address the difficulties in feature point selection, we propose a novel approach using texture-semantic points as features for coarse registration. We first select rich texture points as 2D candidates and establish a 2D-3D matching relationship, giving each candidate its 3D spatial location and associated texture information. Using these correspondences, we perform coarse alignment of the point clouds. However, in reality, the point clouds are not aligned, and the registration calculation fails because of geometric symmetry issues. To address this, we integrate a control net into the iterative closest point (ICP) calculation to guide iterations towards the correct Special Euclidean group in 3 dimensions (SE(3)) transformation, achieving refined alignment. Finally, considering porcelain's symmetrical geometry, we introduce a pose optimization constraint using the symmetry axis as a weighted parameter to limit degrees of freedom and enhance registration accuracy. Experiments were conducted on seven porcelain datasets to evaluate the proposed approach. A qualitative analysis demonstrated successful refined alignment using the proposed approach. In addition, we performed a quantitative comparison with state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results showed that our approach outperformed others across all models when applied to the registration of geometrically symmetric porcelain; Specifically, the proposed method achieved a 50% enhancement in accuracy compared with others, measured by the distance between the labeled corresponding points."
A High-Quality Underwater 3D Reconstruction Solution for Coral Reef Environments Leveraging Advanced Photogrammetric Computer Vision Techniques,"Zhong, Jiageng; Li, Ming; Gruen, Armin; Liao, Xuan; Qin, Jiangying; Wang, Bing",pp. 361-370(10),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000006/art00014;jsessionid=5m1k2bq8fnd15.x-ic-live-03,"Coral reefs, with their intricate 3D structures, are vital marine ecosystems increasingly threatened by environmental stressors. Accurate 3D reconstruction of these underwater structures is essential for scientific research and conservation management. While underwater photogrammetry has emerged as a promising tool for this purpose, technical challenges persist in capturing fine-scale features under underwater conditions, particularly the intricate morphology of coral reefs and the highly complex textures that hinder high-fidelity reconstruction. Recent breakthroughs in computer vision and deep learning have introduced new opportunities for underwater photogrammetry. This study begins by outlining a photogrammetric workflow that can integrate current advanced technologies, followed by summarizing cutting-edge methods used in the key stages, i. e., sparse and dense reconstruction. Building on previous research, we propose a hierarchical reconstruction strategy for accurate and efficient dense modeling. Our approach first performs an efficient global coarse-grained reconstruction to capture the overall scene structure, followed by fine-scale modeling in key regions of interest. Using image data collected from a coral reef site at Moorea Island, we compare and evaluate various techniques, analyzing their respective strengths and limitations. In sparse reconstruction, the classical feature method scale-invariant feature transform demonstrates competitive performance. Deep learning–based methods, such as ALIKED feature and the SuperGlue matching network, achieve superior results on certain metrics. For dense reconstruction, Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting–based methods yield high-quality reconstructions but are computationally intensive. In contrast, the deep learning–based multi-view stereo approach achieves comparable reconstruction quality with greater efficiency. Experimental results on reconstruction result fusion further validate that our approach offers a scalable and practical solution for coral reef monitoring, advancing conservation science and ecosystem management practices."

There are some problems in traditional artificial extraction methods for CR points, such as the difficulty of identifying CR points without prior knowledge, low efficiency, and limited extraction accuracy. An extraction method of the phase center for CR points without prior knowledge was proposed in this paper through the construction of a geometric error compensation model for SAR images and the study of high precision fitting methods of the phase center for CR points.

Furthermore, different crop types have unique spectral, spatial, and phenological characteristics that have not been well understood and fully used for the expected results. This study established a crop-classification framework using the random forest model by integrating four types of features (i. e., spectral reflectance features, vegetation index features, spatial texture features, and crop phenological features) over 15 scenarios generated from Sentinel-2 images. The random forest model performed best (overall accuracy = 92.86%; Kappa coefficient = 0.8995) by integrating the four types of features. We systematically assessed the contribution of feature combinations on individual crop classification. Specifically, different feature combinations can effectively improve the recognition accuracy of different crop types. Our findings can provide great potential in choosing optimal features for crop classifications and benefit the application of machine learning in remote sensing–based crop mapping."

Existing methods work primarily only on aerial data, depend on an external digital terrain model, or do not accurately separate individual buildings. In this work, we present SAT2BUILDING, a method that predicts roof planes, building sections, and building heights in a single, fully convolutional neural network. The network relies on only orthorectified panchromatic imagery and a photogrammetric digital surface model. The three outputs are jointly processed in a level of detail–2 reconstruction pipeline that generates building models that are seamlessly connected, geometrically accurate and complete, and topologically correct. We use spatial embeddings that enable accurate segmentation of building sections and roof planes from satellite imagery. The model generalizes to data from Bonn, Germany, and Lyon, France, after being trained on data from Berlin, Germany. The training and test data differ in lighting conditions, architectural styles, and ground sampling distances. Thorough comparative evaluation shows the superiority of SAT2BUILDING over three baseline methods."

AGC remote sensing inversion was performed while accounting for P. phyllostachysae stress, and changes were analyzed. Results indicate: (1) Carbon content coefficients of Moso bamboo leaves, branches, and culms under pest stress ranged from 0.422 to 0.543 g/g, decreasing with increased stress. (2) A random forest model using multi-source data demonstrated the best performance (R2 = 0.688), estimating average AGC at 28.427 t/ha and total carbon sequestration at 913.902 MtC (Million tons of Carbon). (3) Increased pest stress resulted in gradual reductions in AGC. (4) Pest stress is estimated to result in a carbon sequestration loss of 77.443 MtC. The AGC estimation model indicates thatP. phyllostachysaesignificantly reduces AGC, providing crucial data for understanding carbon cycling and enhancing carbon sink management in Moso bamboo forests."

The PSMNet was trained using three datasets with both automated driving and aerial scenes. Two other distinctive sites were selected to assess the accuracy against LiDAR data. The study found inaccuracies in the PSMNet point clouds and suggested that SGM could potentially result in a better outcome. However, for flat slab or ground surface, its root-mean-square error is better than SGM. The analysis showed that the SGM analyses favorably remove points on vertical surfaces due to occlusion, while PSMNet incorrectly extrapolate them with slopes. Furthermore, the assessment identified the potential to improve PSMNet by using more or in-distribution training dataset for test (unseen) areas."

Automated road network extraction from high-spatial-resolution remotely sensed imagery has shown promise in road network data construction. In recent years, the advent of deep learning algorithms has pushed road network extraction towards auto - mation, achieving very high accuracy. However, the latest deep learning models are often less applied in the field of road network extraction and lack comparative experiments for guidance. Therefore, this research selected three recent deep learning algorithms, including dense prediction transformer (DPT), SegFormer, SEgmentation TRansformer (SETR), and the classic model fully convolutional network-8s (FCN-8s) for a comparative study. Additionally, this research paper compares three different decoder structures within the SETR model (SETR_naive, SETR_mla, SETR_pup) to investigate the effect of different decoders on the road network extraction task. The experiment is conducted on three commonly used datasets: the DeepGlobe Dataset, the Massachusetts Dataset, and Road Datasets in Complex Mountain Environments (RDCME). The DPT model outperforms other models on the Massachusetts dataset with superior reliability, achieving a high accuracy of 96.31% and excelling with a precision of 81.78% and recall of 32.50%, leading to an F1 score of 46.51%. While SegFormer has a slightly higher F1 score, DPT's precision is particularly valuable for minimizing false positives, making it the most balanced and reliable choice. Similarly, for the DeepGlobe Dataset, DPT achieves an accuracy of 96.76%, precision of 66.12%, recall of 41.37%, and F1 score of 50.89%, and for RDCME, DPT achieves an accuracy of 98.94%, precision of 99.07%, recall of 99.84%, and F1 score of 99.46%, confirming its consistent performance across datasets.

To enhance the model's perception of contextual information in complex backgrounds, a multi-scale channel fusion module is constructed to extract features of various scales. To enhance the extracted features, a small-object detection layer and a dynamic channel attention convolution that assigns dynamic weights are proposed. Additionally, this study embeds the large separable kernel attention mechanism into the original network, which lightens the model. Experiments on the HRSC2016 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of ALM-YOLOv8."

However, image fusion solutions are highly disparate to various remote sensing problems and are often narrowly defined in existing reviews as topical applications (e. g., pan sharpening). Theoretically, image fusion can be applied to any gridded data through pixel-level operations; thus, we expand its scope by comprehensively surveying relevant works. We develop a simple taxonomy for many-to-one and many-to-many image fusion, defining it as a mapping problem turning one or multiple images into another set based on desired coherence. Furthermore, we provide a meta-analysis to cover 10,420 peer-reviewed papers from the 1980s to 2023 studying various types of image fusion and their applications.

Then, a novel middle-cross attention fusion block that includes middle features fusion strategy and cross-attention is proposed to fuse spatial-spectral features to enhance their mutual effects, which aims to explore the spatial-spectral structural correlations. Finally, we propose a spectral feature compensation mechanism to provide complementary information for adjacent band groups. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in object values and visual quality."
Machine Learning and New-Generation Spaceborne Hyperspectral Data Advance Crop Type Mapping,"Aneece, Itiya; Thenkabail, Prasad S.; McCormick, Richard; Alifu, Haireti; Foley, Daniel; Oliphant, Adam J.; Teluguntla, Pardhasaradhi",pp. 687-698(12),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2024/00000090/00000011/art00012;jsessionid=s2qei65zqe1p.x-ic-live-03,"Hyperspectral sensors provide near-continuous spectral data that can facilitate advancements in agricultural crop classification and characterization, which are important for addressing global food and water security issues. We investigated two new-generation hyperspectral sensors, Germany’s Deutsches Zentrum für Luft‐ und Raumfahrt Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer (DESIS) and Italy’s PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA), within California's Central Valley in August 2021 focusing on five irrigated agricultural crops (alfalfa, almonds, corn, grapes, and pistachios). With reference data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Cropland Data Layer, we developed a spectral library of the crops and classified them using three machine learning algorithms (support vector machines [SVM], random forest [RF], and spectral angle mapper [SAM]) and two philosophies: 1. Full spectral analysis (FSA) and 2. Optimal hyperspectral narrowband (OHNB) analysis. For FSA, we used 59 DESIS four-bin product bands and 207 of 238 PRISMA bands. For OHNB analysis, 9 DESIS and 16 PRISMA nonredundant OHNBs for studying crops were selected. FSA achieved only 1% to 3% higher accuracies relative to OHNB analysis in most cases. SVM provided the best results, closely followed by RF. Using both DESIS and PRISMA image OHNBs in SVM for classification led to higher accuracy than using either image alone, with an overall accuracy of 99%, producer’s accuracies of 94% to 100%, and user???s accuracies of 95% to 100%."
A Variable-Iterative Fully Convolutional Neural Network for Sparse Unmixing,"Kong, Fanqiang; Lv, Zhijie; Wang, Kun; Fang, Xu; Zheng, Yuhan; Yu, Shengjie",pp. 699-706(8),N/A,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2024/00000090/00000011/art00014;jsessionid=s2qei65zqe1p.x-ic-live-03,"Neural networks have greatly promoted the development of hyperspectral unmixing (HU). Most data-driven deep networks extract features of hyperspectral images (HSIs) by stacking convolutional layers to achieve endmember extraction and abundance estimation. Some model-driven networks have strong interpretability but fail to mine the deep feature. We propose a variable-iterative fully convolutional neural network (VIFCNN) for sparse unmixing, combining the characteristics of these two networks. Under the model-driven iterative framework guided by sparse unmixing by variable splitting and augmented lagrangian (SUnSAL), a data-driven spatial-spectral feature learning module and a spatial information updating module are introduced to enhance the learning of data information. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets show that VIFCNN significantly outperforms several traditional unmixing methods and two deep learning-based methods. On real datasets, our method improves signal-to-reconstruction error by 17.38%, reduces abundance root-mean-square error by 25.24%, and reduces abundance spectral angle distance by 31.40% compared with U-ADMM-ßUNet."

Teacher-Student Prototype Enhancement Network for a Few-Shot Remote Sensing Scene Classification,"Zhu, Ye; Yang, Shanying; Yu, Yang",pp. 621-630(10),N/A,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2024/00000090/00000010/art00012;jsessionid=t3xr5624f817.x-ic-live-02,"Few-shot remote sensing scene classification identifies new classes from limited labeled samples where the great challenges are intraclass diversity, interclass similarity, and limited supervision. To alleviate these problems, a teacher-student prototype enhancement network is proposed for a few-shot remote sensing scene classification. Instead of introducing an attentional mechanism in mainstream studies, a prototype enhancement module is recommended to adaptively select high-confidence query samples, which can enhance the support prototype representations to emphasize intraclass and interclass relationships. The construction of a few-shot teacher model generates more discriminative predictive representations with inputs from many labeled samples, thus providing a strong supervisory signal to the student model and encouraging the network to achieve accurate classification with a limited number of labeled samples. Extensive experiments of four public datasets, including NWPU-remote sens ing image scene classification (NWPU-RESISC45), aerial image dataset (AID), UC Merced, and WHU-RS19, demonstrate that this method achieves superior competitive performance than the state-of-the-art methods on five-way, one-shot, and five-shot classifications."

This method uses the properties that lidar can provide elevations under trees and open water edges are visible in orthoimages to extract the planimetric locations of bank lines. The orthoimage pixels with less than 0.15% slope on the DEM were replaced by water pixels. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted using DEM, slope, and orthoimage bands. Training data of river body and the background were identified manually on the first three component images. An alpha matting–based method was implemented using the training data to extract the bank lines. Bankline using α value of 50% probability were statistically and visually better when compared to the manual bank lines."

The boom length and angle data were output from a control device, a controller area network. For efficient development, a simulator that imitated the environment of an actual machine was developed and used. The proposed method uses optical flow to track feature points. The classification was performed successfully, independent of derricking motion. Consequently, the proposed method contributes to stable 3D mapping around cranes in construction sites."

Multi-scale neighborhood feature learning methods are suitable for inhomogeneous density point clouds, but different scale branching feature learning increases the computational complexity and makes it difficult to accurately fuse different scale features to express local information. In this study, a point cloud semantic segmentation network based on RandLA-Net with multi-scale local feature aggregation and adaptive fusion is proposed. The designed structure can reduce computational complexity and accurately express local features. The mean intersection-over-union is improved by 1.1% on the SemanticKITTI data set with an inference speed of nine frames per second, while the mean intersection-over-union is improved by 0.9% on the S3DIS data set, compared with RandLA-Net.

It is well known and mathematically proven that additional parameters (APs) can compensate image distortions and remaining error sources by a rigorous photogrammetric bundle-block adjustment. Thus, kernel functions based on orthogonal wavelets (e. g., asymmetric Daubechies wave- lets, least asymmetric Daubechies wavelets, Battle-Lemarié wavelets, Meyer wavelets) are used to build the wavelets-based family of APs for self-calibrating digital frame cameras. These new APs are called wavelet APs. Its applications in rigorous tests are accomplished by using aerial images taken by an airborne digital mapping camera in situ and practical calibrations. The test results demonstrate that these orthogonal wavelet APs are applicable and largely avoid the risk of over-parameterization. Their external accuracy is evaluated using reliable and high precision check points in the calibration field."

Many researchers have developed spectrum libraries based on the actual aging of asphalt pavements, and it is possible to construct pavement health indices based on spectrum changes. Some indexes can extract different aging degrees of asphalt pavement from optical satellite images. Of course, current research can only preliminarily reflect the aging phenomenon of asphalt pavement and cannot accurately describe the distress characteristics of asphalt pavement. Future research needs to further strengthen mechanism research, develop higher resolution images, improve image processing technology, and adopt multi-means fusion analysis methods."

In this study, a method for detecting building shadows in GF‐2 images based on improved quick shift was proposed. First, six feature variables were constructed: first principal component (PC1), brightness component (I), normalized difference shadow index (NDSI), morphological shadow index (MSI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Then, the image was segmented to obtain homogeneous objects, which were then classified using a random forest model. Two improvements were added to the quick shift algorithm: using PC1, I, and MSI as input data instead of RGB images; and adding Canny edge constraints. Validation in six research areas yields Kappa coefficients of 0.928, 0.896, 0.89, 0.913, 0.879, and 0.909, confirming method feasibility. In addition, comparative experiments demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness across different land cover types while mitigating the segmentation scale effect."

Diverse geological processes generate irregular alteration patterns with diverse spectral characteristics in mineral deposits. Applying remotely sensed hyperspectral images (HSIs) is an appealing technology for geologic surveyors to generate alteration maps. Conventional methods mainly use shallow spectral absorption features to discriminate minerals and cannot extract their important spectral information. Deep neural networks with nonlinear layers can evoke the deep spectral and spatial information of HSIs. Deep learning-based methods include fully connected neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and hybrid convolutional networks like mixed convolution neural network and covariance pooling (MCNN‐CP) algorithms. However, each has its advantages and limitations. To significantly avoid losing important spectral features, we proposed a new method by fusing a one‐dimensional convolutional neural network (1D‐CNN) with MCNN‐CP (1D‐MCNN‐CP), achieving an overall accuracy (97.44%) of mineral mapping from PRISMA HSIs. This research deduced that 1D‐MCNN‐CP improved performance and reduced misclassification errors among minerals sharing similar spectral features."

Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieved F1 scores of 0.87 for insulator detection and 0.89 for insulator defect detection. The improved YOLOv5 network shows promise in detecting insulators and their defects in UAV images."

Seagrass is vital for many species in the lagoon, but nutrient overloading, algal blooms, boating, manatee grazing, and other factors have led to its loss. To understand this decline, a deep neural network analyzed Landsat imagery from 2000 to 2020. Results showed significant seagrass loss post-2013, coinciding with the 2011–2013 super algal bloom. Seagrass abundance varied annually, with the model performing best in years with higher seagrass coverage. While the deep learning method successfully identified seagrass, it also revealed that recent seagrass coverage is almost non-existent. This monitoring approach could aid in ecosystem recovery if coupled with appropriate policies for Mosquito Lagoon's restoration."

Our experimental findings from PS-InSAR and SBAS-InSAR revealed that the deformation rates in the study region ranged between –50 to 20 mm/year and –30 to 10 mm/year, respectively. Furthermore, the deformation rates of the same points, as determined by these methods, exhibited a significant increase prior to the event. We also investigated the causal relationship between rainfall and landslide events, demonstrating that deformation rates correlate with changes in rainfall, albeit with a time lag. Therefore, using time-series InSAR for landslide monitoring in Xinmo Village is a viable approach."

This study thus examines underwater photogrammetry methods using a widely recognized action camera as a reference and compares it with another camera of similar characteristics as a potential alternative. For a comprehensive temporal analysis in underwater studies, both cameras were used to capture photographic and video imagery, and the resulting 3D point clouds were compared. Comparison criteria included data collection and processing times, point cloud densities, cloud-to-cloud analysis, and assessments of surface density and roughness. Having analysed, the study concluded that the proposed alternative action camera can feasibly be used in underwater photogrammetry."

This technique focuses on approximating returns for empty pulses that hit spots near abrupt slope changes on building and ground surfaces. The proposed methodology is validated through experiments using a lidar data set from downtown Dublin, Ireland. The collected data contained numerous gaps associated with wet surfaces, as well as missing returns on vertical and oblique surfaces."

We first implement a gradient-based mutual information method to filter out low-quality frames while preserving the integrity of the videos. After frame pose estimation, the geometric properties of the baseline are constrained by three aspects to extract the keyframes: quality of relative orientation, baseline direction, and base to distance ratio. The three-dimensional model is then reconstructed based on these extracted keyframes. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach maintains a strong robustness throughout the aerial triangulation, leading to high levels of reconstruction precision across diverse video scenarios. Compared to other methods, this paper improves the reconstruction accuracy by more than 0.2 mm while simultaneously maintaining the completeness."

However, in some applications, dense point cloud has no practical meaning. How to effectively sample from the dense points and maximize the preservation of terrain features is extremely important. This paper will propose a DEM sampling algorithm that utilizes terrain complexity and maximal Poisson-disk sampling to extract key feature points for adaptive DEM sampling. The algorithm estimates terrain complexity based on local terrain variation and prioritizes points with high complexity for sampling. The sampling radius is inversely proportional to terrain complexity, while ensuring that points within the radius of accepted samples are not considered new samples. This way makes more points of concern in the rugged regions. The results show that the proposed algorithm has higher global accuracy than the classic six sampling methods."

Existing methods relying solely on Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images are prone to texture ambiguity in complex illumination environments. Furthermore, façades display varying orientations and camera viewing angles, resulting in performance issues within the RGB color space. In this study, we introduce an illumination-invariant façade recognition network (I2-FaçadeNet) that leverages sparsely gated multi-color space experts for enhanced façade image recognition in challenging illumination environments. First, RGB façade images are converted into multi-color spaces to eliminate the ambiguous texture in complex illumination. Second, we train expert networks using separate channels of multi-color spaces. Finally, a sparsely gated mechanism is introduced to manage the expert networks, enabling dynamic activation of expert networks and the merging of results. Experimental evaluations leveraging both the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing benchmark data sets and the Shenzhen data sets reveal that our proposed I2-FaçadeNet surpasses various depths of ResNet in façade recognition under complex illumination conditions. Specifically, the classification accuracy for poorly illuminated façades in Zurich improves by nearly 8%, while the accuracy for over-illuminated areas in Shenzhen increases by approximately 3%. Moreover, ablation studies conducted on façade images with complex illumination indicate that compared to traditional RGB-based ResNet, the proposed network achieves an accuracy improvement of 3% to 4% up to 100% for overexposed images and an accuracy improvement of 3% to 10% for underexposed images."

The results showed that the overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the proposed method for rice identification reached 99.4%, 99.5%, 99.5%, and 99.5%, respectively, achieving a better performance than the support vector machine classifier. Therefore, the proposed method can effectively reduce the confusion between rice and other types and accurately extract rice distribution information under complex surface conditions."
Combination of Terrestrial Laser Scanning and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Photogrammetry for Heritage Building Information Modeling: A Case Study of Tarsus St. Paul Church,"Fidan, Şafak; Ulvi, Ali; Yiğit, Abdurahman Yasin; Hamal, Seda Nur Gamze; Yakar, Murat",pp. 753-760(8),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2023/00000089/00000012/art00008;jsessionid=31mb10rlkfj6b.x-ic-live-03,Cultural heritage building information modeling (HBIM) is an emerging process allowing us to reconstruct built heritage virtually. The data of a digitally documented cultural heritage building offers significant advantages as it is accessible and modifiable by all professionals involved in the same or different projects. The most important factor affecting the accuracy and precision of the HBIM model is the ability to collect complete and accurate information about the physical structure. Combining terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry point clouds is one of the most efficient ways to capture accurate digital data on the building. This study provides the foundation for creating an HBIM model for cultural heritage the coupling of spatial data with TLS and UAV. This paper aims to generate synergy between TLS and UAV point cloud data and ensure that the spatial database contains sufficient data to model historical objects with HBIM tendencies.
"Quantifying Impacts of Regional Multiple Factors on Spatiotemporal the Mechanisms for Spatio-temporal changes of Net Primary Vegetation Productivity and Net Ecosystem Productivity: An Example in the Jianghuai River Basin, China","Chen, Huimin; Wang, Benlin; Zheng, Liangfeng; Shahtahmassebi, ZhengAmirReza",pp. 761-771(11),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2023/00000089/00000012/art00009;jsessionid=31mb10rlkfj6b.x-ic-live-03,"Despite much valuable research on the mechanisms for spatio-temporal changesof net primary vegetation productivity (NPP) and net ecosystem productivity (NEP), there is a paucity of information on assessing impacts of regional multiple factors on spatiotemporal researchs of NPP and NEP in the complex environment. This study attempts to bridge this information gap using the Jianghuai Basin in China as a case study. Using a field campaign, remotely sensed imagery, socioeconomic data, and meteorological parameters, we developed a framework based on the Carnegie‐Ames‐Stanford Approach (CASA) model, correlation technique, trend analysis, and landscape metrics to measure spatiotemporal changes in NPP and NEP from 2001 to 2018. The derived changes were then linked to regional multiple factors including climate, landscape factors, human activity, and land use change. The results of the research can provide a scientific basis for vegetation evaluation, ecosystem assessment, and other aspects of the region."
Identification of Critical Urban Clusters for Placating Urban Heat Island Effects over Fast-Growing Tropical City Regions: Estimating the Contribution of Different City Sizes in Escalating UHI Intensity,"Dutta, Kanaya; Basu, Debolina; Agrawal, Sonam",pp. 667-677(11),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2023/00000089/00000011/art00006;jsessionid=1v06o3eufics1.x-ic-live-01,"The incessant rise of artificial surfaces has increased the temperatures of cities, distressing urban health and sustainability. Fast-growing tropical cities particularly call for an understanding of this phenomenon, known as the urban heat island (UHI). The present study was conducted to detect UHI dynamics over the National Capital Region of India. Stretching over more than 32 000 km2, this region consists of urban centers of varying sizes. Landsat thermal bands were processed to extract temperature patterns between 1999 and 2019. Urban climate change was prominent, as a 2349-km2expansion in UHI area was spotted. Urban clusters of different sizes were demarcated by applying the k-nearest neighbor algorithm on the normalized difference building index maps. This empirical analysis helped to form a logarithmic relation between city size and UHI intensity. Observed results set a framework to assess the thermal environment of numerous urban centers from any tropical country. UHI intensity values for various city sizes were computed, as they were crucial to decide the outdoor comfort zones based on the base temperature conditions of other cities. Further, the critical zones in each urban cluster were identified using the vegetation index, and scopes of landscaping were suggested based on the observed building morphologies of different local climate zones."
A Novel Object Detection Method for Solid Waste Incorporating a Weighted Deformable Convolution,"Xu, Xiong; Cheng, Tao; Zhao, Beibei; Wang, Chao; Tong, Xiaohua; Feng, Yongjiu; Xie, Huan; Jin, Yanmin",pp. 679-689(11),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2023/00000089/00000011/art00008;jsessionid=1v06o3eufics1.x-ic-live-01,"Rapid detection of solid waste with remote sensing images is of great significance for environmental protection. In recent years, deep learning-based object detection methods have been widely studied. In contrast to regular objects such as airplanes or buildings, solid wastes commonly h ave arbitrary shapes with difficult‐to‐distinguish boundaries. In this study, a solid waste detection network with a weighted deformable convolution and a global context block based on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) model was proposed. The designed feature extraction structure can help to enhance the boundary and shape features of solid waste. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified on the well-known DetectIon in Optical Remote sensing images data set and further on a solid waste data set, which was collected by the authors manually. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other traditional object detection methods and a maximum improvement of 5.27% was obtained compared to the FPN method."
An Integrated Approach for Wildfire Photography Telemetry using WRF Numerical Forecast Products,"Tan, Ling; Ma, Xuelan",pp. 691-701(11),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2023/00000089/00000011/art00009;jsessionid=1v06o3eufics1.x-ic-live-01,"Forest fire detection using machine vision has recently emerged as a hot research topic. However, the complexity of background information in smoke images often results in deep learning models losing crucial details while capturing smoke image features. To address this, we present a detection algorithm called Multichannel Smoke YOLOv5s (MCSYOLOv5s). This algorithm comprises a smoke flame detection module, multichannel YOLOv5s (MC‐YOLOv5s), and a smoke cloud classification module, Smoke Classification Network (SCN). MC‐YOLOv5s uses a generative confrontation structure to design a dual‐channel feature extraction network and adopts a new feature cross-fusion mechanism to enhance the smoke feature extraction ability of classic YOLOv5s. The SCN module combines Weather Research and Forecasting numerical forecast results to classify smoke and clouds to reduce false positives caused by clouds. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed forest fire monitoring method, MCS‐YOLOv5s, achieves higher detection accuracy of 95.17%, surpassing all comparative algorithms. Moreover, it effectively reduces false alarms caused by clouds."
A Powerful Correspondence Selection Method for Point Cloud Registration Based on Machine Learning,"Tao, Wuyong; Xu, Dong; Chen, Xijiang; Tan, Ge",pp. 703-712(10),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2023/00000089/00000011/art00010;jsessionid=1v06o3eufics1.x-ic-live-01,"Correspondence selection is an indispensable process in point cloud registration. The success of point cloud registration largely depends on a good correspondence selection method. For this purpose, a novel correspondence selection method is proposed in this paper. First, two geometric constraints, one of which is proposed in this paper, are used to compute the compatibility score between two correspondences. Then, the feature vectors of the correspondences are constructed according to the compatibility scores between the correspondence and others. A support vector machine classifier is trained to classify the correct and incorrect correspondences by using the feature vectors. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can choose the right correspondences well and get high precision and F-score performance. Also, our method has the best robustness to noise, pointdensity variation, and partial overlap compared to the other methods."
