                This review describes the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP), explores strengths and weaknesses of the data, and summarizes how the data are used in land cover and feature extraction tasks in order to provide some recommendations for future research and best practices for working withNAIPdata.NAIPorthoimagery is an often-overlooked source for remote sensing classification and feature extraction applications in the contiguous United States (CONUS).NAIPdata are free, or nearly free; are in the public domain; are available for all of theCONUS; comprise a multitemporal data set that spans more than a decade; and are collected at a high spatial resolution with generally very low cloud coverage. However, there are challenges associated with the use of these data. The low spectral resolution limits spectral differentiation, while the high spatial resolution results in very large data sets for study areas even as small as a single county. Differences in acquisition dates and time of day result in varying illumination conditions and potentially even varying phenological state. As a consequence, image digital number (DN) values can vary between adjacent tiles, and shadow size and direction can be inconsistent between different tiles and different acquisitions. Therefore, taking full advantage of this valuable data source requires the analyst to be cognizant of such concerns and take measures to deal with such inconsistency and minimize its impact on the classification results; future research addressing these concerns would further enhance the value ofNAIPdata.

            Double Projection Planes Method for Generating Enriched Disparity Maps from Multi-View Stereo Satellite Images

                The use of disparity information is computationally coste-ffective for 3D-assisted mapping applications. However, off-nadir satellite images over dense urban areas suffer from severe occlusion. Therefore, large gaps will be created due to the unsuccessful matching in the occluded areas. Commonly, gap interpolation produces misleading information that destroys the quality of the subsequent information extraction application. Hence, the more reliable solution is to fill the occlusion gaps by supplementary data. However, disparity maps are the co-relation of one stereo pair. Hence, supplementary disparity maps cannot be directly generated and applied. Thus, this paper introduces the Double Projection Plane (DPP) method for constructing disparity proportionality among multi-view stereo satellite images and calculating analytically the transferring scales required for producing supplementary disparity data. Accordingly, based on multi-view stereo satellite images, this method is promising to provide gap-and-outlier-free disparity maps that have the potential to replace the need for elevation models to some extent.

            Screw Displacement-Based Bundle Block Adjustment Considering Correlation
        </a>

                In a traditional bundle block adjustment model that separately determines the position and orientation elements of each exposure station, inaccurate initial values of exterior orientation elements (EOPs) lead to a strong correlation relationship between rotation and translation matrices defined byEOPs. To rectify this correlation problem, this paper introduces a screw displacement based bundle block adjustment (SDA) model, in which an imaging ray's screw displacements described by dual quaternion are used to construct a collinearity equation. BySDA, the position and orientation elements are determined jointly. To evaluate the robustness and efficiency ofSDA, a group of progressive experiments were conducted on three types of datasets, including synthetic, close-range, and aerial images. Experimental results demonstrate thatSDAovercomes theEOPcorrelation problems and achieves reliable positioning accuracies for large-angle oblique photographic structures.

            Motion Segmentation Using Global and Local Sparse Subspace Optimization

                In this paper, we propose a new framework for segmenting feature-based moving objects under the affine subspace model. Since the feature trajectories are high-dimensional and contain the noise, we first apply the sparsePCAto represent the original trajectories with a low-dimensional global subspace, which consists of the orthogonal sparse principal vectors. Then, the local subspace separation is obtained using automatically searching the sparse representation of the nearest neighbors for each projected data. In order to refine the local subspace estimation and deal with the missing data problem, we propose an error estimation function to encourage the projected data that span a same local subspace to be clustered together. Finally, the segmentation of different motions is achieved through the spectral clustering on an affinity matrix, which is constructed with both the error estimation and the sparse neighbor optimization. We evaluate our proposed framework by comparing it to other motion segmentation algorithms. Our method achieves improved performance on state-of-the-art benchmark datasets.

                Many scientific disciplines need to locate, digitize, and integrate the collections of historical ecological data that often remain hidden in paper archives. Synthesizing historical and contemporary ecological data with ecosystem models can help researchers understand how species, communities, and landscapes are changing across space and time. Since these data are often stored in multiple collections and in various formats, data integration can be challenging. This paper presents a case study of the digitization of a large historical vegetation survey, i.e., the Wieslander Vegetation Type Mapping (VTM) project in California which highlights the importance of recovering and sharing such datasets. The protocol developed to digitize, georeference, visualize, and share these data is founded in geospatial concepts, and theVTMproject showcases the increasingly important role of geospatial experts in the fields of ecology, history, and other sciences. These methods are flexible, transferable and broadly applicable to other fields.
