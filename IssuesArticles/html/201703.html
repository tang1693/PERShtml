                This research deals with the automatic generation of 2D land cover maps of urban areas using very high resolution multispectral aerial imagery. The appropriate selection of classifier and attributes is important to achieve high thematic accuracies. In this paper, new attributes are generated to increase the discriminative power of auxiliary information provided by remote sensing images. The generated attributes are derived from the vegetation index and elevation information using morphological attribute profiles. The extended experimental evaluation and comparison of attribute profile-based mapping solutions is conducted to derive the optimal combinations of attributes required for classification and to understand the genericity of attributes on a range of classifiers, i.e., various combinations of attributes and classifiers. Experimental results with two high resolution images show that the proposed attributes derived on auxiliary information outperform the existing attribute profiles computed on original image and its principal components.

                The traditional spatial-spectral classification methods applied to hyperspectral remote sensing imagery are conducted by combining the spatial information vector and the spectral information vector in a separate manner, which may cause information loss and concatenation deficiency between the spatial and spectral information. In addition, the traditional morphological-based spatial-spectral classification methods require the design of handcrafted features according to experience, which is far from automatic and lacks generalization ability. To automatically represent the spatial-spectral features around the central pixel within a spatial neighborhood window, a novel spatial-spectral feature classification method based on the unsupervised convolutional sparse auto-encoder (UCSAE) with a window-in-window strategy is proposed in this study. TheUCSAEalgorithm features a unique spatial-spectral feature extraction approach which is executed in two stages. The first stage represents the spatial-spectral features within a spatial neighborhood window on the basis of spatial-spectral feature extraction of sub-windows with a sparse auto-encoder (SAE). The second stage exploits the spatial-spectral feature representation with a convolution mechanism for the larger outer windows. TheUCSAEalgorithm was validated by two widely used hyperspectral imagery datasets (the Pavia University dataset and the Washington DC Mall dataset) obtaining accuracies of 90.03 percent and 96.88 percent, respectively, which are better results than those obtained by the traditional hyperspectral spatial-spectral classification approaches.

                Automatic road network extraction from satellite images is currently considered to be an important research trend in the field of remote sensing and photogrammetry. This paper presents a method for automatic extraction of road networks from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. The method consists of three steps. During the first step, road area candidates are detected based on the fusion of extracted features: minimum radiance, contrast, and direction of minimum radiance. In the second step, several refinement criteria are used in order to discard detected false candidates, and a thinning morphology operator is applied on the road areas to extract the road segments. Seed points of interest are then extracted to using in a network snake model, which is employed in the third step to connect the seed points in order to form the road network. Minimizing the energy function of the Snake model and then using a perceptual grouping algorithm is for discarding redundant segments and avoiding gaps between segments is used sequentially in the network snake model. The proposed algorithm is tested on TerraSAR-X images with different areas. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method is effective in terms of correctness, completeness, and quality. An accuracy assessment showed that the proposed model is capable of achieving a quality index between 56 to 82.5 percent.

                Road slopes and superelevations are important elements in road widening and self-navigation investigations. This article proposes to automatically extract road slopes and superelevations from data collected by a mobile laser scanning (MLS) system. The proposed method is implemented as follows: (a) a hierarchical segmentation is constructed to dynamically retain point clouds on the road surface; (b) the point clouds are divided into dynamically segmented blocks using trajectory points, and plane estimation is investigated to continuously estimate road slopes and superelevations; and (c) the estimated slopes and superelevations are iterated and filtered to decrease the influence of outliers. The proposed method was tested and validated for inclining and winding road types. The estimated slopes and superelevations satisfied real road conditions.

            Unsupervised Object-Based Differencing for Land-Cover Change Detection

                One main problem of the spectral decomposition-based change detection method is the lack of efficient automatic techniques for developing the difference image. Traditional techniques generally assume that gray-level values in a difference image are independent and multitemporal images are co-registered/rectified perfectly without error. However, such assumptions are often violated because of the inevitable image misregistration and the interference of correlations between spectral bands. This study proposes an automated method based on the object-based multivariate alteration detection/maximum autocorrelation factor approach and the Gaussian mixture model-expectation maximization algorithm to obtain unsupervised difference images. This procedure is applied to bi-temporal (2005 and 2006)SPOT-HRVimages at Panyu District Ponds, China. Results show that the proposed method successfully excludes the correlations of spectral bands and the influence of misregistration, as evidenced by a higher accuracy (up to 93.6 percent). These unique technical characteristics make this analytical framework suitable for detecting changes.

                A comprehensive mapping technology was developed utilizing standard image processing and availableGISprocedures to automate shoreline identification and mapping from 2 m synthetic aperture radar (SAR)HHamplitude data. The development used fourNASAUninhabited Aerial Vehicle SAR (UAVSAR) data collections between summer 2009 and 2012 and a fall 2012 collection of wetlands dominantly fronted by vegetated shorelines along the Mississippi River Delta that are beset by severe storms, toxic releases, and relative sea-levelrise. In comparison to shorelines interpreted from 0.3 m and 1 m orthophotography, the automatedGIS10 m alongshore sampling foundSARshoreline mapping accuracy to be ±2 m, well within the lower range of reported shoreline mapping accuracies. The high comparability was obtained even though water levels differed between theSARand photography image pairs and included all shorelines regardless of complexity. TheSARmapping technology is highly repeatable and extendable to otherSARinstruments with similar operational functionality.

                One main problem of the spectral decomposition-based change detection method is the lack of efficient automatic techniques for developing the difference image. Traditional techniques generally assume that gray-level values in a difference image are independent and multitemporal images are co-registered/rectified perfectly without error. However, such assumptions are often violated because of the inevitable image misregistration and the interference of correlations between spectral bands. This study proposes an automated method based on the object-based multivariate alteration detection/maximum autocorrelation factor approach and the Gaussian mixture model-expectation maximization algorithm to obtain unsupervised difference images. This procedure is applied to bi-temporal (2005 and 2006)SPOT-HRVimages at Panyu District Ponds, China. Results show that the proposed method successfully excludes the correlations of spectral bands and the influence of misregistration, as evidenced by a higher accuracy (up to 93.6 percent). These unique technical characteristics make this analytical framework suitable for detecting changes.

                A comprehensive mapping technology was developed utilizing standard image processing and availableGISprocedures to automate shoreline identification and mapping from 2 m synthetic aperture radar (SAR)HHamplitude data. The development used fourNASAUninhabited Aerial Vehicle SAR (UAVSAR) data collections between summer 2009 and 2012 and a fall 2012 collection of wetlands dominantly fronted by vegetated shorelines along the Mississippi River Delta that are beset by severe storms, toxic releases, and relative sea-levelrise. In comparison to shorelines interpreted from 0.3 m and 1 m orthophotography, the automatedGIS10 m alongshore sampling foundSARshoreline mapping accuracy to be ±2 m, well within the lower range of reported shoreline mapping accuracies. The high comparability was obtained even though water levels differed between theSARand photography image pairs and included all shorelines regardless of complexity. TheSARmapping technology is highly repeatable and extendable to otherSARinstruments with similar operational functionality.
