                Random forests as a novel ensemble learning algorithm have significant potential for land cover mapping in complex areas but have not been sufficiently tested by the remote sensing community relative to some more popular pattern classifiers. In this research, we implemented random forests as a pattern classifier for land cover mapping from a satellite image covering a complex urban area, and evaluated the performance relative to several popular classifiers including Gaussian maximum likelihood (GML), multi-layer-perceptron networks (MLP), and support vector machines (SVM). Each classifier was carefully configured with the parameter settings recommended by recent literature, and identical training data were used in each classification. The accuracy of each classified map was further evaluated using identical reference data. Random forests were slightly more accurate thanSVMandMLPbut significantly better thanGMLin the overall map accuracy. Random forests and support vector machines generated almost identical overall map accuracy, but the former produced a smaller standard deviation of categorical accuracies, suggesting its better overall capability in classifying both homogeneous and heterogeneous land cover classes. Random forests have shown its robustness due to the most accurate classification on the whole, relatively balanced performance across all land cover categories, and relatively easier to implement. These findings should help promote the use of random forests for land cover classification in complex areas.

                Accurate and robust retrieval of grassland canopy water content (CWC) using a radiative transfer model (RTM) is generally affected by the ill-posed inversion problem due to the lack of enough available a priori information. To alleviate this problem when inversing theRTM, a two-step inversion method was proposed. The key point of this method was to simultaneously consider the spectral information from neighboring pixels and the spatial dependency among these pixels, with the purpose to win more information from these neighboring pixels. The proposed methodology was then applied to retrieveCWCusing thePROSAIL RTMfrom Landsat-8OLIdata for a plateau grassland in China. The results showed that the estimatedCWCusing the proposed method (RMSE= 67.31 g m-2and R2= 0.81) was better than that from the traditional method (RMSE= 80.11 g m-2and R2= 0.78) which only considered the information of single pixel.

                Urban villages (UVs) are a typical informal settlement in China resulting from the rapid urbanization in recent decades. Their formation and demolition are attracting increasing interest. In the remote sensing community,UVshave been detected based on hand-crafted features. However, the hand-crafted features just consider one or several characteristics ofUVs, and ignore many effective cues hiding in the image. Recently, deep learning has been used to automatically learn suitable feature representations from a huge amount of data, without much expertise or effort in designing features. Motivated by its great success, this paper aims to use deep learning for detectingUVs. Because of the scarce labeled samples, this paper presents a novel unsupervised deep learning method to learn a data-driven feature. Experiments show the data-driven feature obtained with the proposed method outperform the existing unsupervised deep neural networks, and achieve results comparable to that obtained using the best hand-crafted features.

                Specific professional bids to perform aerial data collection using large manned aerial vehicles (LMAV), small manned aerial vehicles (SMAV), and small unmanned aerial systems (UAS) were used to generate general bid models. From these bid models, it was determined what collection methods were competitive for particular jobs based on the project area, distance from the airport or office, and the modeled bids from competing methods. This approach is followed by a discussion of each platform's limitations and versatility. Results indicate thatUASandSMAVand can compete efficiently on aerial photogrammetric mapping up to at least 1,000 acres when the equipment gets enough usage. It is conjectured that this methodology will exert significant downward pressure on the cost of high-end sensors.
