                This investigation was motivated by the need for radiometric calibration of the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) thermal band (Band 6), covering its 25 years of operation. Through fusion of environmental data and physical modeling, a vicarious calibration approach was implemented. Results, which were demonstrated to agree with data from previous field campaigns, indicate the Landsat-5 thermal band has been calibrated to better than 1 K over the 24 years in orbit. The data indicate the sensor exhibits a small gain error (approximately constant over time) and a bias shift for all data post-1999. The lifetime calibration error can be reduced to 0.49 K, in reference to a 300 K blackbody, by a pair of linear corrections. This study established that the methodology presented can be implemented to achieve a very high level of radiometric integrity, applicable to both historic and current data from remote thermal infrared systems.

                This paper proposes a modified subspace classification method (MSCM) tlwt integrates an extended multiple similarity method with the averaged leaming subspace method to achieve improved land-cover classification perfonnance. Fwthermore, we developed an automatic parameter selection and optimization technique for MSCM to avoid time-consuming, laborious manual parameter tuning. Only three parameters need to be set, and their optimal values are easily determined by the automatic procedure. We cmried out experiments with data of two multispectral images: Landsat TM data for a semi-arid area in the Horqin sandy land, China, and ASTER data for the Kasumigaura Lake region, Japan, a high humidity, warm temperature zone. Accuracy assessment of tl1e MSCM results in comparison with those of the suppo1t vector machine (SVM) and maximum likelihood classification (MLC) methods showed that the MSCM yielded better classification results. Therefore, the proposed MSCM shows promise as a tool for land-cover classification.

            Detection Thresholds for Rare, Spectrally Unique Targets within Semiarid Rangelands

                Many factors influence classification accuracy, and this study assessed detection thresholds for various sub-pixel targets using QuickBird multispectral image1y. Six iterations of maximum-likelihood classification were used to determine classification accuracy for 100 spectrally unique targets randomly placed aver a semiarid rangeland site. Error matrices were calculated using independent validation sites and producer's, user's, and overall accuracy, Kappa Index of Agreement, and transformed divergence were analyzed to compare the performance of each classification and determine detection thresholds. Results indicate a strong relationship between target size and classification accuracy (R2= 0.94) as well as an increasingly prominent role played by training site selection as target size decreased. Strong spectral separability and good classification accuracies were achieved for targets >25 percent cover. Sub-pixel targets <25 percent in size were not detectable. This study highligilts the effect of target size upon classification accuracy and has direct implications for invasive plant research and rare target detection.

            Off-nadir Viewing for Reducing Spectral Mixture Issues in Citrus Orchards

                A modeling approach to determine optimal viewing angles that reduce the impact of signal mixtures in orchards was evaluated on citrus. Orchards statistics from high-resolution images in Florida and Western Cape province (South Africa) citrus producing areas show that pixel unmixing between adjacent fields can be avoided for pixel sizes below 10 to 15 m, while within fields mixing (canopy, soil, and weeds) is inevitable with multi- and hyperspectral sensors. A virtual 3D environment was constructed in which off-nadir pointing simulations were made for different field orientations. Spectral similarity based contribution indices were derived to find overflight times and viewing angles that reduce the impact of seasonality, soil and weeds. Although no single optimal view direction was found for all scenarios, optimal results in mature orchards were consistently obtained by early acquisitions and low oblique viewing perpendicular to or at a 45° angle with the row orientation, opposite to the solar azimuth.

                The proposed method in this paper uses circular statistics for the analysis of errors in the positional accuracy of geometric corrections satellite images using Independent Check Lines (ICL) instead of Independent Check Points (ICP). Circular statistics has been preferred because of the vecto-rial nature of the spatial error. A study case has been presented and discussed in detail. From the TERRA-ASTER images of Extremadura area (Spain), the Ground Control Point (GCP), ICP, and ICL data were acquired using differential GPS through field survey, and the planimetric positional accuracy was analyzed by both the conventional method (using ICP) and the proposed method (using ICL). Comparing conventional and proposed methods, the results indicated that modulus statistics are similar (e.g., RMSE of Geometric Correction 1 were 17.5 for the conventional method and 17.2 m for proposed method). But as additional results, azimuthal component statistics was calculated (e.g., mean direction: 247.2° in Geometric Correction 1), and several tests were made which showed the error distribution are not uniform and normal.
