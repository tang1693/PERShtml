                The 2014 Data Fusion Contest, organized by the Image Analysis and Data Fusion (IADF) Technical Committee of the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society, involved two datasets acquired at different spectral ranges and spatial resolutions: a coarser-resolution long-wave infrared (LWIR, thermal infrared) hyperspectral data set and fine-resolution data acquired in the visible (VIS) wavelength range. In this article, a novel multi-level fusion approach is proposed to fully utilize the characteristics of these two different datasets to achieve improved urban land-use and land-cover classification. Specifically, road extraction by fusing the classification result of the TI-HSI dataset and the segmentation result of theVISdataset is first proposed. Thereafter, a novel gap inpainting method for the VIS data with the guidance of the TI-HSI data is presented to deal with the swath width inconsistency, and to facilitate an accurate spatial feature extraction step. The experimental results with the 2014 Data Fusion Contest datasets suggest that the proposed method can alleviate the multi-spectral-spatial resolution and multi-swath width problem to a great extent, and achieve an improved urban classification accuracy.

                Gully is a type of young geological feature on the Martian surface, and the study of gullies can significantly contribute to understanding of the geologic history of Martian surface. As a large amount of high-resolution orbital images have been acquired, manual identification and extraction of all gullies is tedious and prohibitively time consuming. Therefore, it is desirable to develop automated methods for detection of Martian gullies to support scientific studies of the gullies. This paper presents an automated gully detection method based on mathematical morphology techniques. The method integrates a series of morphological operators, including area opening and closing, Bottom-Hat transformation, and path opening. Experimental results using HiRISE images at six sites demonstrate promising performance with detection percentage from 76 percent to 94 percent.

            The Multiple Comparison Problem in Empirical Remote Sensing

                This paper seeks to draw attention to the multiple comparison problem (MCP) within the remote sensing community, and suggest some easily implemented solutions. The use of repeated statistical tests by remote sensing scientists to identify significant relationships, increases the chance identifying false positives (i.e., type-I errors) as the number of tests increases. This paper provides an introduction to the multiple comparison problem (i.e., the impact of the interpretation of p-values when repeated tests are made), outlines some simple solutions, and provides two case studies to demonstrate the potential impact of the problem in empirical remote sensing. The first case study looks at multiple potential texture metrics to predict leaf area index. The second case study examines pixel-wise temporal trend detection. The results show how applying solutions to the multiple comparison problem can greatly impact the interpretation of statistical results.

                The ZiYuan-3 satellite (ZY-3) was China's first civilian stereo mapping satellite designed to meet the 1:50 000 scale mapping requirements. We analyzed main error sources influencing the geometric accuracy of theZY-3images, and the error propagation rules of these error sources in image production. Accuracy estimation models ofZY-3images without ground control points (GCPs) were deduced and the theoretical geometric accuracy ofZY-3images was obtained. WithoutGCPs, 556ZY-3panchromatic nadir images covering 3,500,000 km2of the Chinese mid-west region and 12ZY-3stereo image pairs covering 14,000 km 2 around Taiyuan of China were used for planar and vertical accuracy verification, respectively. The experimental results confirmed the correctness of the accuracy estimation model forZY-3images. The accuracy results obtained through the model and experiment showed that withoutGCPs, the geometric accuracy of theZY-3images satisfied the Chinese stereo mapping requirements for 1:50 000 scale topographic maps.

            Nighttime-Lights-Derived Fossil Fuel Carbon Dioxide Emission Maps and Their Limitations

                Brightness of nighttime lights has been used as an indicator for spatial disaggregation of CO2emission based on an assumed linear relationship between the digital number (DN) values of nighttime light imagery and the amount of CO2emissions. However, reliability of the linear relationship of these variables has not been thoroughly examined. In this study we find that the actual overall correlations are exponential rather than linear. More specific analyses showed that the DN values of nighttime light imagery first behaves linearly (from 3 to 50) and then exponentially (from 51 to 63), correlating to the amount of CO2emissions. Regardless of the use of a linear or piecewise function, some featured limitations are evident as we developed the methodology. Among significant limitations, CO2emissions were not visualized in unlit areas and a lack of variation existed in regions with the same DN values of nighttime light imagery. Lastly CO2emissions in urban core areas were grossly under-estimated.
