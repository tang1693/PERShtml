                The sudden oak death (SOD) epidemic in California has resulted in hundreds of thousands of dead trees in the complex of oak(Quercus)and tanoak(Lithocarpus)woodland that exist in patches along the California coast. Monitoring SOD occurrence and spread is an on-going necessity in the state. Remote sensing methods have proved to be successful in mapping and monitoring forest health and distribution when a sufficiently small ground resolution is used. Supervised, unsupervised, and “hybrid” classification methods were evaluated for their accuracy in discriminating dead and dying tree crowns from bare areas and the surrounding forest mosaic utilizing 1-m ADAR imagery covering both tanoak/redwood forest and mixed hardwood stands. In both study areas the hybrid classifier significantly outperformed the other methods, producing low omission and commission errors among information classes. The hybrid method was then further refined by varying three parameters of the algorithm (iteration number, homogeneity threshold, and number of classes) and accuracy was assessed. The results demonstrate that while the hybrid method outperformed the other classifiers, the parameters that yielded highest accuracy for the algorithm differed between the two study areas. The use of a randomly selected subsample of training pixels was compared to the use of polygonal training areas, and we found that polygonal training data provided better classification accuracies in both cases.

                Mangroves are difficult to map accurately from satellite data by means of parametric classification because of their spectral similarity to other coastal vegetation despite their habitat being inside coastal waters. This study aims to improve the mapping accuracy through incorporation of such spatial knowledge about mangroves in the Waitemata Harbor of Auckland, New Zealand, from SPOT data. The spatial knowledge was combined with spectral knowledge in the mapping. Supervised classification was found to map stunted and lush mangroves at an accuracy of, respectively, 46.7 percent and 68.3 percent. These accuracy levels rose, respectively, to 83.3 percent and 96.7 percent after the spatial knowledge was sequentially incorporated into the mapping. A similar accuracy level was achieved from knowledge-based spatial reasoning. If integrated simultaneously with spectral knowledge, spatial knowledge did not improve the accuracy noticeably because of difficulty in gaining quality spectral knowledge. It is concluded that knowledge-based, post-classification processing considerably improves the accuracy of mapping mangroves over parametric classification.

                Fire-prone landscapes are increasingly being settled. Monitoring this development is an emerging need, and a low-cost method would benefit emergency managers. Existing change-detection methods can be expensive and time consuming when applied to low-density urban change in large, vegetated areas. Nighttime satellite imagery is explored as means for addressing this problem, and a case study is presented for Colorado. The results indicate that from 1992–2000, Grand County had the greatest absolute increase in ambient sprawl into fire-prone areas (215 km2), but Teller County had the greatest percentage increase (7.3 percent). In 2000, La Plata County had the most ambient development in fire-prone areas (909 km2), but Jefferson County had the greatest percentage (42 percent). The paper concludes with a discussion of the prospects and problems of the approach.

            Integrating JERS-1 Imaging Radar and Elevation Models for Mapping Tropical Vegetation Communities in Far North Queensland, Australia

                The “Wet Tropics World Heritage Area” in Far North Queens-land, Australia consists predominantly of tropical rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest in areas of variable relief. Previous maps of vegetation communities in the area were produced by a labor-intensive combination of field survey and air-photo interpretation. Thus, the aim of this work was to develop a new vegetation mapping method based on imaging radar that incorporates topographical corrections, which could be repeated frequently, and which would reduce the need for detailed field assessments and associated costs. The method employed a topographic correction and mapping procedure that was developed to enable vegetation structural classes to be mapped from satellite imaging radar. Eight JERS-1 scenes covering the Wet Tropics area for 1996 were acquired from NASDA under the auspices of the “Global Rainforest Mapping Project.” JERS scenes were geometrically corrected for topographic distortion using an 80 m DEM and a combination of polynomial warping and radar viewing geometry modeling. An image mosaic was created to cover the Wet Tropics region, and a new technique for image smoothing was applied to the JERS texture bands and DEM before a Maximum Likelihood classification was applied to identify major land-cover and vegetation communities. Despite these efforts, dominant vegetation community classes could only be classified to low levels of accuracy (57.5 percent) which were partly explained by the significantly larger pixel size of the DEM in comparison to the JERS image (12.5 m). In addition, the spatial and floristic detail contained in the classes of the original validation maps were much finer than the JERS classification product was able to distinguish. In comparison to field and aerial photo-based approaches for mapping the vegetation of the Wet Tropics, appropriately corrected SAR data provides a more regional scale, all-weather mapping technique for broader vegetation classes. Further work is required to establish an appropriate combination of imaging radar with elevation data and other environmental surrogates to accurately map vegetation communities across the entire Wet Tropics.

                Filtering the airborne laser scanner data is challenging due to the complex distribution of objects on Earth’s surface and it is still in development stage. This problem has been investigated so far with varieties of algorithms, but they suffer from different magnitudes of drawbacks. This study proposed a new and improved hybrid method based on multi-resolution analysis. Wavelet was adopted in this multi-resolution clustering approach. It enabled the classification of objects based on their size and the efficiency to filter out unwanted information at a specific resolution, and the proposed algorithm is named theALSwave(Airborne Laser Scanner Wavelet) method.ALSwavehas been tested on two data sets acquired over the urban areas of Tokyo, Japan and Stuttgart, Germany. The results showed a well-filtered, bare earth surface coupled with acceptable computational time. The accuracy assessment was carried out by comparison between the filtered bare earth surface byALSwaveand the manually filtered surface. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) follows a linear relationship with respect to terrain slope. This wavelet-based approach has opened a new way to filter the raw laser data that subsequently generates fast and more accurate digital terrain models.

                Accurate measurement of impervious surface (IS) cover is an essential indicator of downstream water quality and a critical input variable for many water quality and quantity models. This study compares IS estimates from a recently developed satellite imagery/land cover approach with a more traditional aerial photography/land use approach. Both approaches are evaluated against a high-quality validation set consisting of planimetric data merged with manually-delineated areas of soil disturbance. The study area is the rapidly urbanizing 127 km2Cub Run watershed in northern Virginia, located on the fringe of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan region. Results show that photo-interpreted IS estimates of land class are higher than satellite-derived IS estimates by 100 percent or more, even in land uses conservatively assigned high IS values. Satellite-derived IS estimates by land class correlate well with planimetric reference data (r[Needspace]0.95) and with published ranges for similar sites in the region. Basin-wide mean IS values, difference grids, and regression and density plots validate the use of satellite-derived/land cover-based IS estimates over photo-interpreted/land use-based estimates. Results of this site-specific study support the use of automated, satellite-derived IS estimates for planning and management within rapidly urbanizing watersheds where a GIS system is in place, but where time-sensitive, high quality planimetric data is unavailable.

                Schistosomiasis is a water-borne parasitic disease endemic in tropical and subtropical areas. Its transmission depends upon the presence of snails, which serve as intermediate hosts for the parasite. Some efforts have been made to classify snail habitats with remotely sensed data, but not to estimate snail abundance that is an important parameter in schistosomiasis transmission modeling. In this research, snail density was predicted by integrating the field survey and satellite images of different spatial resolution. A mountainous environment near Xichang city, in southwest Sichuan province, China, was chosen as the test site. Land-cover and land-use information extracted from 4 m resolution Ikonos data and elevation data derived from ASTER (Advanced Space-borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) data were used as reference for scaling up to greater spatial extents. Therefore, we estimated land-cover and land-use fraction data at the 30 m resolution level based on classification results from the Ikonos data. Snail abundance for each 30 m resolution grid was then predicted by regressing field survey data with land-cover and land-use fractions. Subsequently, a snail density map was generated using the territory of each of the over 200 residential groups as a mapping unit. An R2of 0.87 was obtained between the average snail density predicted and that surveyed for 19 groups. With such a model, we were able to extrapolate scattered snail abundance surveyed at a limited number of sites to the entire area. Spatial autocorrelation of snail distribution was considered as one of the possible factors in predicting snail density and tested for further model calibration.

                We used National Land Cover Data 92 (NLCD 92), vector impervious surface data, and raster GIS overlay methods to derive impervious surface coefficients per NLCD 92 class in portions of the Mid-Atlantic physiographic region. Sample areas for the study were thirty-six subwatersheds ranging in size from 2 km2to 150 km2. A three-category rural-to-urban gradient design was utilized due to the changing sub-pixel relationship of impervious surface areas within developed/non-developed areas. A gradient rule based on the NLCD 92 DEVELOPED%defined the sample areas as “rural” (<18 percent ‘developed’), “intermediate” (18 percent–40 percent ‘developed’) and “dense suburban” (40.01 percent–80 percent ‘developed’). The gradient scheme produced three separate sets of coefficients per NLCD 92 Level 1 and Level 2 class. Results show distinct per-class coefficient groupings across the rural-to-urban gradient with coefficients directly related to the increasing level of development in a subwatershed. We also developed a linear equation between the NLCD 92 DEVELOPED%and truth percent impervious area. Results show a relative accuracy of approximately 80 percent and a mean absolute TIA%estimate error of approximately 2.0 percent±1.0 percent for both the Level 1 coefficients and the Level 2 coefficients. Results derived from the linear regression model show a relative accuracy of 70 percent with a mean absolute TIA%estimate error of approximately 2.0 percent±1.0 percent. This suggests that a linear model can be used as a rapid assessment tool to approximate TIA%from NLCD 92 data. Results are based on a spatial aggregation of pixels to the subwatershed or “whole-area” scale and are most applicable to “pour-point” models utilizing a single percent impervious surface area parameter. The models reported here have been tested only in the Mid-Atlantic region (USEPA Federal Region 3).
