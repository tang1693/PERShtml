                This paper proposes an automatic and fast algorithm for registering aerial image sequences to vector map data using linear features as control information. Our method is based on the extraction of linear features using active contour models (also known as, snakes), followed by the construction of a polygonal template upon which a matching process is applied. To accommodate more robust matching, this work presents both exact and inexact matching schemes for linear features. Additionally, in order to overcome the influence of the snakes-based extraction process on the matching results, a matching refinement process is suggested. Using the information derived from the matching process, we then determine the transformation parameters between overlapping images and generate a mosaic image sequence, which can then be registered to a map. The performance of the proposed scheme was tested on sequences of aerial imagery of 1 m resolution that were subjected to shifts and rotations using both the exact and inexact matching scheme, and was shown to produce angular accuracy of less than 0.7 degrees and positional accuracy of less than two pixels.

                The Hellenic Cadastre Program (HCP) of Greece aims at developing a modern cadastral system for the first time in the Hellenic history. This paper is focused on the issues related to cadastral forestlands digital mapping, an indispensable part of HCP. Mapping the forestlands is a challenge of multiple disciplines. It includes photogrammetry, photointerpretation, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and a clear understanding of the current institutional and legislative setting. The process requires both historical and current information pertaining to land-cover in order to identify forestland changes over time. Historical and current digital orthoimagery is generated through photogrammetric operations. Forestlands are delineated in a spatiotemporal environment; state property rights in forestlands are allocated and land ownership is established within the framework of HCP. This paper demonstrates that the integration of airborne remote sensing and collateral data with a GIS is an effective approach for cadastral forest mapping. The produced GIS databases and large-scale Forest Maps may serve as a data foundation towards a land register of forests.

                There is no research which specifically investigates the influence of the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) on topographic correction of satellite images. Such an investigation is necessary in view of the very high resolution (VHR) of recent sensors such as Ikonos and QuickBird and the low availability of accurate height information for the derivation of slope and aspect values. A comparative study of multispectral Ikonos images is presented using eight selected interpolation techniques with contour data. The DEM influence was evaluated by analyzing the variance and classification accuracy of topographically corrected images using the different DEMS. These were found to vary widely, with a 30 percent reduction in variance and a 20 percent improvement in overall classification accuracy between the worst and best performing interpolation techniques. Furthermore, smoothing techniques commonly used for the removal of noise in interpolated contour data or in existing DEMs were found to offer no significant improvement in intra-class variance or classification accuracy, when used with a grid resolution compatible with VHR images. However, a more rigorous planar slope function was found to be more effective, and when combined with the best interpolator, the natural neighbor, or Sibson, method, very high classification accuracy was achieved in the topographically corrected images.

                The development of digital global databases containing data such as elevation and soil can greatly simplify and aid in the classification of remotely sensed data to create land-use classes. An efficient method that can simultaneously handle diverse input dimensions can be formed by merging fuzzy logic and neural networks. The so-called granular or fuzzy neural networks are able not only to achieve high classification levels, but at the same time produce compressed and transparent neural network skeletons. Compression results in reduced training times, while transparency is an aid for interpreting the structure of the neural network by translating it into meaningful rules and vice versa. The purpose of this paper is to provide some initial guidelines for the construction of granular neural networks in the remote sensing context, while using global elevation ancillary data within the classification process.

                A Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager-2 (CASI) dataset was used for detecting mortality and vegetation stress associated with a new forest disease. We first developed a multilevel classification scheme to improve classification accuracy. Then, the CASI raw data were transformed to reflectance and corrected for topography, and a principal component (PC) transformation of all 48 bands and the visible bands and NIR bands were separately conducted to extract features from the CASI data. Finally, we classified the calibrated and corrected CASI imagery using a maximum likelihood classifier and tested the relative accuracies of classification across the scheme. The multilevel scheme consists of four levels (Levels 0 to 3). Level 0 covered the entire study area, classifying eight classes (oak trees, California bay trees, shrub areas, grasses, dead trees, dry areas, wet areas, and water). At Level 1, the vegetated and non-vegetated areas were separated. The vegetated and non-vegetated areas were further subdivided into four vegetated (oak trees, California bay trees, shrub areas, grasses) and four non-vegetated (dead trees, dry areas, wet areas, and water) classes at Level 2. Level 3 identified stressed and non-stressed oak trees (two classes). The ten classes classified at different levels are defined as final classes in this study. The experimental results indicated that classification accuracy generally increased as the detailed classification level increased. When the CASI topographically corrected reflectance data were processed into ten PCs (five PCs from the visible region and five PCs from NIR bands), the classification accuracy for Level 2 vegetated classes (non-vegetated classes) increased to 80.15 percent (94.10 percent) from 78.07 percent (92.66 percent) at Level 0. The accuracy of separating stressed from non-stressed oak trees at Level 3 was 75.55 percent. When classified as a part of Level 0, the stressed and non-stressed were almost inseparable. Furthermore, we found that PCs derived from visible and NIR bands separately yielded more accurate results than the PCs from all 48 CASI bands.

                World War I formed the incubator for aerial reconnaissance and photointerpretation. This study, based upon official histories and archival materials, including correspondence, reports, unit histories, and related documents, surveys the development of photoreconnaissance as practiced by the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) during the period 1917 to 1919. The most visible advances were technologic improvisations, developed in the field that integrated the camera and the airplane to form, arguably, the most effective intelligence resource of the conflict. Technological innovations were accompanied by parallel developments in organizational and training infrastructures necessary to derive information for images acquired by these instruments. Interpretation techniques developed from simple annotations of oblique photographs acquired using handheld cameras to sophisticated analyses of images acquired by automatic cameras suspended in the aircraft fuselage. As the war concluded, efforts were underway to develop foundations for photogrammetric methods to derive accurate planimetry, which later formed foundations for civil applications of aerial photography.

                Comprehensive field-testing and calibration of digital photogrammetric systems are essential to characterize their performance, to improve them, and to be able to use them for optimal results. The radiometric, spectral, spatial, and geometric properties of digital systems require calibration and testing.The Finnish Geodetic Institute has maintained a permanent test field for geometric, radiometric, and spatial resolution calibration and testing of high-resolution airborne and satellite imaging systems in Sjökulla since 1994. The special features of this test field are permanent resolution and reflectance targets made of gravel. The Sjökulla test field with some supplementary targets is a prototype for a future photogrammetric field calibration site.This article describes the Sjökulla test field and its construction and spectral properties. It goes on to discuss targets and methods for system testing and calibration, and highlights the calibration and testing of digital photogrammetric systems.

                In this article, we present the use of the Automatic Ground control points Extraction technique (AGE) for increasing the automation in the geometric correction of high-resolution satellite imagery. The method is based on an image-to-image matching between the satellite data and an already geocoded image (i.e., a digital orthophoto). By using an adaptive least squares matching algorithm which implements a very robust outlier rejection technique, AGE can automatically measure many hundreds of topographic features (TFs) on the images, whose cartographic coordinates are derived from the geo-coded image and elevations are extracted from an associated digital elevation model (DEM). The AGE technique has been tested for different high-resolution data: (a) 0.62-meter QuickBird panchromatic data (basic imagery processing level), (b) 2.5-meter SPOT-5/HRG panchromatic supermode data (standard 1B processing level), and (c) 1-meter Ikonos panchromatic data (standard Geo product processing level) collected in the Northern of Italy, both in flat (Torino Caselle test site) and mountain areas (Lecco test site). Regardless the relative image resolution between the satellite and the aerial data (1-meter) and regardless the processing level of the original satellite data, a similar TFs density has been obtained for both the QuickBird and the SPOT-5/HRG data (4.4 GCPs/km2and 4.1 GCPs/km2) respectively, with a geometric accuracy for the GCPs extracted of 0.90 m for QuickBird and 3.90 m for SPOT-5/HRG. For the Ikonos imagery, AGE extracted a more dense set of GCPs (8.7 GCPs/km2) but with a lower accuracy (3.19 m). The TFs identified with AGE can be used as GCPs for the rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs) computation and, therefore, for implementing a full automatic orthoimage generation procedure. By using the commercial off-the-shelf software PCI Geomatica®v.9.1, orthoimages have been generated for all datasets. The geometric accuracy was verified on a set of 30 manually measured independent check points (CPs) and assessed a precision of 4.99 m RMSE for QuickBird, 5.99 m RMSE for SPOT-5/HRG, and 8.65 m RMSE for Ikonos. The use of a non-conventional image orthorectification technique implementing a neural network GCPs regularization, tested for the SPOT-5/HRG data, showed the full potential of the AGE method, allowing to obtain a 3.83 m RMSE orthoprojection in a fully automated way.

                In agricultural remote sensing, applied images should be acquired frequently enough in order to monitor important crop growth stages. Thanks to the cloud penetrating and flexible swath-positioning capabilities of space-borne SAR at present, images can be acquired even at the interval of few days during a growing season. In this study, dual-polarization (VV/VH) Envisat SAR images with high a temporal resolution were used in association with limited ancillary data to monitor crop growth and to classify crop species. It was noticed that the high temporal resolution enabled nearly continuous monitoring, but it also caused problems because of the varying incidence angles. Moreover, to carry out field surveys rapidly enough for research purposes was observed as a problem. An R2of 0.55 was obtained for estimating the crop growth, when average crop height in parcels was used to describe the amount of biomass. An overall accuracy of 74.7 percent was achieved for crop species classification. Envisat VH polarization appeared to be useful in the estimation, even though, the noise equivalent σ0was too high to detect early crop growth. Field-based averaging was required, thus, for example for precision farming purposes a better spatial resolution would be needed to detect biomass variations within parcels.
