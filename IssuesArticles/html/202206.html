                Satellite altimetry is an effective technique for monitoring water level changes in inland lakes in remote areas, such as the Tibetan Plateau. Lake water footprint (LWF) determination from tracks of satellite altimetry data is a preliminary step for generating lake water level sequences. However, the traditional method of LWF determination using accurate lake boundaries extracted from remote sensing images is laborious, and the images do not always exist. Another method dedicated to a single satellite altimeter sensor, i.e., physical parameter-based algorithm has been designed, but this method sometimes fails when data are influenced by surroundings such as wetlands or glaciers. To overcome these problems, we present a novel linear clustering-based approach for LWF determination to generate a time series of lake water levels by using multi-mission satellite altimetry data sets over typical lakes of the Tibetan Plateau. Our method projects all footprints onto two matrices. This approach is then illustrated using Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite, Environmental Satellite, and CryoSat-2 altimetry data sets for four typical lakes in the Tibetan Plateau. Among all the methods, our method performs best in terms of accuracy. Finally, the time series lake water levels of 179 lakes in the Tibetan Plateau were extracted using our method. The results indicate that from 2002 to 2020, the average water level of most lakes increased by 0.167 ± 0.155 m/a, whereas a decreasing trend of 0.066 ± 0.047 m/a was observed in the Yarlung Zangbo river basin. The different precipitation conditions in the inner basin and the Yarlung Zangbo river basin are suggested to be the major reasons for the opposite trends. The proposed method performs well for Tibetan lakes with planar water stages and small seasonal fluctuations but is not applicable for lakes with other conditions, which requires further study.

                This study aimed to develop and apply a manual procedure for clas-sifying and georeferencing indoor point clouds that we created using Paracosm's PX-80 handheld three-dimensional laser scanner. We collected data for 11 buildings in Connecticut, USA and focused on classifying features-of-interest to public safety personnel (i.e., doors, windows, fire alarms, etc.). ArcGIS Desktop was used to manually digitize features that were easily identified in the point cloud and Paracosm's Retrace was used to digitize small features for which imag-ery was needed for identification. We developed several tools in Python to facilitate point cloud classification and georeferencing. The procedure allowed accurate mapping of features as small as a sprinkler head. Point cloud classification and georeferencing for a 14 000 m2 building took 20–40 hours, depending on building characteristics and the types of features mapped. The methods can be applied in map-ping a wide variety of features in indoor or outdoor environments.

                The Pajarito fault system is a complex zone of deformation and a seismically active region nestled within the Rio Grande rift in north-central New Mexico. Numerous laterally discontinuous faults and associated folds and fractures interact in a manner that has important implications for seismic hazards and risk mitigation. Previous efforts have established a foundation for the location of lineaments and structures in the Pajarito fault system; however, ensuring the completeness of the current lineament mapping is required for identifying areas for field validation, evaluating the potential for future seismic activity, and better understanding fault interaction. Assistance with this fault-mapping task via automated or semiautomated techniques as applied to lidar data over a large area of interest is highly desirable. A proof-of-concept processing flow which transforms lidar point-cloud data into a raster of surficial fault candidates is described and illustrated herein. These initial results hold great promise toward achieving our ultimate goal.

                In the process of manual image interpretation, the use of a combination of spectral and spatial features can aid in more accurately classifying urban land coverage. In this study, to simulate this procedure, we use two concurrent convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with two scales of input to represent fields of view corresponding to object detail and the related information among objects. In our approach, the results derived from every convolution process are retained and stacked together at the end of the convolution process. Thus, not only are the spectral and spatial features combined, but all the scales of spatial features are also considered. When applied to very-high-resolution remote sensing images, our proposed model with its feature-based CNN achieves a noticeable improvement over other state-of-the-art methods, which helps to assess the urban environment to some extent. In addition, we show that the digital surface model features, either in image form or in numerical characteristic form, can improve the overall accuracy rate of current structures.

            Conjunctive Use of Landsat-8 OLI and MODIS Data for Delineation of Burned Areas

                For regional-level monitoring of burned areas, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS ) MCD64A1 and MCD45A1 products have been operationally used. However, because of their coarser spatial resolution, such products do not allow for detection of small patches (<50 ha) of burned areas, which are very important for modeling gas emissions. In order to bridge this gap, we undertook a study to evaluate the synergy of MCD64A1 and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI ) data for delineating burned areas in part of the mountainous terrain of the Himalayas, northern India. The approach involves generating a differenced normalized burn ratio image from Landsat-8 OLI data before and after fire events, refining the burned areas thus delineated using the MCD64A1 burned-area product and field data, and estimating accuracy. An overall mapping accuracy of 90.0% was achieved using Landsat-8 OLI data. Inclusion of the MODIS MCD64A1 burned-area product resulted in marginal improvement in overall accuracy (to 94.0%).
