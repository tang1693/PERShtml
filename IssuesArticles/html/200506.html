                We detected road pixels in aerial imagery using a multi-resolution, wavelet-based approach. Our method involved the description of a differential geometry approach for road seed pixel detection in terms of wavelet transforms. Using this approach allowed us to extend the differential geometry approach to incorporate multiple scales. We found that using multiple scales significantly reduced the number of potential false positives. Our approach seemed to work well with a computer-assisted approach where the “seed” or potential pixels of interest should have a high confidence level of being correct. We found that our approach led to an effective method for detecting roads in aerial imagery. Our method is general, and in principle could be applied to other filtering techniques besides the one used here.

                The enormous increase in the volume of datasets acquired by lidar systems is leading towards their extensive exploitation in a variety of applications, such as, surface reconstruction, city modeling, and generation of perspective views. Though being a fairly new technology, lidar has been influenced by and had a significant impact on photogrammetry. Such an influence or impact can be attributed to the complementary nature of the information provided by the two systems. For example, photogrammetric processing of imagery produces accurate information regarding object space break lines (discontinuities). On the other hand, lidar provides accurate information describing homogeneous physical surfaces. Hence, it proves logical to combine data from the two sensors to arrive at a more robust and complete reconstruction of 3D objects. This paper introduces alternative approaches for the registration of data captured by photogrammetric and lidar systems to a common reference frame. The first approach incorporates lidar features as control for establishing the datum in the photogrammetric bundle adjustment. The second approach starts by manipulating the photogrammetric imagery to produce a 3D model, including a set of linear features along object space discontinuities, relative to an arbitrarily chosen coordinate system. Afterwards, conjugate photogrammetric and lidar straight-line features are used to establish the transformation between the arbitrarily chosen photogrammetric coordinate system and the lidar reference frame. The second approach (bundle adjustment, followed by similarity transformation) is general enough to be applied for the co-registration of multiple three-dimensional datasets regardless of their origin (e.g., adjacent lidar strips, surfaces in GIS databases, and temporal elevation data). The registration procedure would allow for the identification of inconsistencies between the surfaces in question. Such inconsistencies might arise from changes taking place within the object space or inaccurate calibration of the internal characteristics of the lidar and the photogrammetric systems. Therefore, the proposed methodology is useful for change detection and system calibration applications. Experimental results from aerial and terrestrial datasets proved the feasibility of the suggested methodologies.

                In this study, we demonstrated that ecologically meaningful, detailed biotic communities can be mapped with high accuracy (85 percent) in a soil dominated semi-arid environment using a simple supervised classification approach with Landsat TM data, if an appropriate classification algorithm and truly representative training signatures are applied. We used the Supervised Spectral Angle Classifier by Sohn and Rebello (2002) to map biotic communities in the Upper San Pedro Valley, Arizona. By choosing an image acquisition date (season) that can maximize the differentiation of feature characteristics associated with each biotic community, and adopting the Supervised Spectral Angle Classifier that is sensitive to the spectral shape pattern, we were able to map biotic communities without the secondary, derived variables such as DEM, soil, and seasonal NDVI, seasonal greenness indices to incorporate environmental factors and phenological changes of vegetation into the classification procedures. Biotic communities and land cover categories mapped in this study include: Chihuahuan desert-scrub, mesquite scrub, Chihuahuan semi-desert grassland (<30 percent grass-forbs cover density, >30 percent grass-forbs cove density, and disclimax), Madrean encinal woodland, Madrean montane conifer forest, mesquite bosque, riparian gallery, irrigated pasture/golf course, urban/developed, bare soil, and water. Our study reaffirmed that the Spectral Angle Classifier can potentially be one of the most robust and accurate classifiers. Also, according to our study, the current spatial, spectral, and radiometric characteristics of Landsat TM data seem effective for mapping detailed vegetation communities even in a semi-arid environment.

            Analysis of Urban Land Cover and Population Density in the United States

                In this study we investigate the question of whether urban and suburban areas in the United States can be defined on the basis of demographic and/or physical characteristics, in particular, population density and vegetation abundance. We investigate their relationship in the cities of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Phoenix, and Seattle and compare the results with the USGS National Land Cover Dataset’s urban classes. The bimodal distribution of U.S. population density provides a demographic basis for distinguishing rural and suburban land use, while a distinct tail of high population densities (>10,000 people/km2) corresponds to high intensity urban residential cores. Results show that the maximum vegetation fraction diminishes with increasing population density, but the spectral heterogeneity at pixel scales still results in a wide range of vegetation fractions within demographically urban and suburban areas. None of the USGS residential classes show a strong correspondence to either vegetation fraction or population density. However, quantitative characterization of vegetation abundance provides a basis for comparison of the physical environments of suburban areas. We suggest that classification schemes based on spectral heterogeneity at multiple pixel scales, supplemented by auxiliary data sources, may provide a more accurate and self-consistent way to quantify urban land use and analyze urban growth than traditional thematic classification schemes.

                The aim of this paper is to present a photogrammetric method for determining the dimensions of flat surfaces, such as billboards, based on a single digital image. A mathematical model was adapted to generate linear equations for vertical and horizontal lines in the object space. These lines are identified and measured in the image and the rotation matrix is computed using an indirect method. The distance between the camera and the surface is measured using a lasermeter, providing the coordinates of the camera perspective center. Eccentricity of the lasermeter center related to the camera perspective center is modeled by three translations, which are computed using a calibration procedure. Some experiments were performed to test the proposed method and the achieved results are within a relative error of about 1 percent in areas and distances in the object space. This accuracy fulfills the requirements of the intended applications.

                Recent developments of digital cameras in terms of the size of a Charged Coupled Device (CCD) and Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) arrays, as well as reduced costs, are leading to their applications in traditional and new photogrammetric, surveying, and mapping functions. Such cameras require careful calibration to determine their metric characteristics, as defined by the Interior Orientation Parameters (IOP), which are essential for any photogrammetric activity. Moreover, the stability of the estimated IOP of these cameras over short and long time periods has to be analyzed and quantified. This paper outlines the incorporation of straight lines in a bundle adjustment procedure for calibrating off-the-shelf/low-cost digital cameras. A framework for automatic extraction of the straight lines in the images is also presented and tested. In addition, the research introduces new approaches for testing the camera stability, where the degree of similarity between reconstructed bundles using two sets of IOP is quantitatively evaluated. Experimental results with real data proved the feasibility of the line-based self-calibration approach. Analysis of the estimated IOP from various calibration sessions over long time periods revealed the stability of the implemented camera.

                Analysis of common neighborhood definitions for airborne laser data, triangulation or raster-based, reveals deficiencies in modeling the measured objects. Concepts that originate from 2D data structures are used for modeling complex 3D objects and for handling datasets with different point densities. Realizing these shortcomings, this paper proposes a new neighborhood system for airborne laser data. Based on laser data characteristics the proposed systems consider, among other features, point density, layered and overhanging structures, and local surface trends. Parameters for the proposed systems are derived from theoretical and practical observations. The paper demonstrates the type of neighborhood that is established by the proposed systems, and shows that artifacts that are usually created by the common neighborhoods are avoided here, and that structures within the data that are usually masked are revealed. The paper demonstrates how subsequent applications benefit from the new system. Finally, the estimation of surface normals by the proposed systems is compared to the triangulation; results show a significant improvement in the reliability and quality of the estimation.
