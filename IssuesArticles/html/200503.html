                Standards that have been created for the reporting of data quality in spatial databases focus primarily on database level metadata, which does not address the issue of varying quality within a dataset. This issue may be advanced by the inclusion of metadata at an object level. The Land Cover Map 2000 (LCM2000) is a national database for theUKand contains a large amount of object-based quality metadata, which is reviewed. An analysis of uncertainty in the extent of three land cover types is carried out using a cumulative evidence method, utilizing a number of existing datasets, each purporting to represent the extent of the phenomenon in question. The output of this analysis is compared to the metadata in the LCM2000, in order to assess the usefulness of the metadata in understanding attribute accuracy. Results of this comparison are presented, showing that some of the object-based metadata gives a useful indication as to the certainty of classification.

                Generic sensor models (GSMs) are comprehensive mathematical models by which different geometric structures of satellite images could be modeled in order to establish the connection between image and object spaces. Nevertheless, as they are mathematical models, rather than physical models, it is difficult to determine which term and order of GSMs can provide the best result. Therefore, conventional solutions need an expert operator to try different terms and orders for the best solution of GSMs or to find the best trade-off, which is a complex and time consuming process. Moreover, conventional solutions for automatic determination of the optimum GSM parameters are not practically efficient and instead of going towards the global optimum, frequently get trapped in some local optima. In this paper we propose a novel methodology which automatically determines the optimum GSM’s terms and orders based on genetic algorithm concepts. Extensive evaluations carried out on a wide range of different optical satellite images demonstrate the high potentials of the proposed strategy.

                Schinus terebinthifolius,known as Brazilian pepper, is an exotic, invasive plant species in Florida that displaces native plant species and disrupts wildlife habitat. Aerial surveys typically used to monitor ecosystem change may be augmented with texture analyses to improve the speed and consistency with whichS. terebinthifoliusis detected in the images. Image processing using high-resolution imagery can take advantage of high spectral variability in adjacent pixels of the same cover type by measuring spatial patterns of texture in neighborhoods of pixels.Texture features derived from first and second-order statistics and edge components in high-resolution digital color infrared images were tested for their ability to discriminateS. terebinthifolius.Multiple linear logistic regressions found a best subset combination of texture features that consistently identified core areas ofS. terebinthifolius.Misclassification of other cover types asS. terebinthifoliuswas low except whereSabal palmettowas present in the images.

            Leaf Optical Property Changes Associated with the Occurrence ofSpartina alternifloraDieback in Coastal Louisiana Related to Remote Sensing Mapping

                In order to provide a remote sensing solution that would detect both the initial onset and monitor the early, as well as, the later stages of impact progression, changes in live leaf optical properties were compared along transects spanning impacted coastal Louisiana marsh sites. Green and red edge reflectance trends generally represented the early stages and fairly well the later stages of dieback progression, while blue and red reflectance and absorption trends represented the later stages of marsh impact that were most closely related to visible signs of marsh impact. Leaf reflectance in the near infrared (NIR) was not compatible with visual reflectance trends and did not co-vary with derived indicators of leaf water content, and thereby, water stress. Predicted from reflectance ratios, carotene tended to remain constant or increase relative to chlorophyll following noted changes in stressed plants at the two least impacted sites, while the pigments co-varied at the two most impacted sites. As an operational solution most amenable for satellite remote sensing, theNIR/red ratio followed blue and red reflectance trends while theNIR/green ratio mimicked the green and red edge reflectance trends indicating impact onset and progression, as well as, generally portraying blue and red reflectance trends indicating later stages of impact. The NIR/ green ratio magnitude and range generally increased from the most to least impacted site providing a convenient method to detect dieback onset and monitor dieback progression. This research demonstrated that remote sensing mapping at these sites could offer a more accurate perception of dieback severity distribution than offered by determinations relying on visible indicators of marsh changes.

                This paper compares three methods for removing non-ground measurements from airborne laser scanning data. These methods, including the elevation threshold with expanding window (ETEW), maximum local slope (MLS), and progressive morphological (PM) filters, analyze data points based on variations of local slope, and elevation. Low and high-relief data sets with various densities of trees, houses, and sand dunes were selected to test the filtering methods. The results show that all three methods can effectively remove most non-ground points in both low-relief urban and high-relief forested areas. The PM filter generated the best result in coastal barrier island areas, whereas the other algorithms tended to remove the tops of steep sand dunes. Each method experienced various omission or commission errors, depending on the filtering parameters. Topographic slope is the most sensitive parameter for the three filtering methods.

                Image registration is concerned with the problem of how to combine data and/or information from multiple sensors in order to achieve improved accuracies and better inference about the environment than could be attained through the use of a single sensor. Registration of imagery and information from multiple sources is essential for a variety of applications in remote sensing, medical diagnosis, computer vision, and pattern recognition. In general, an image registration methodology must deal with four issues. First, a decision has to be made regarding the choice of primitives for the registration procedure. The second issue is concerned with establishing the registration transformation function that mathematically relates geometric attributes of corresponding primitives. Then, a similarity measure should be devised to ensure the correspondence of conjugate primitives. Finally, a matching strategy has to be designed and implemented as a controlling framework that utilizes the primitives, the similarity measure, and the transformation function to solve the registration problem. This paper outlines a comprehensive investigation and implementation of the involved issues in a semi-automatic registration procedure capable of handling multi-source satellite imagery with varying geometric resolutions.

                This study presents an exemplar-based nested hyper-rectangle learning model (NHLM) which is an efficient and accurate supervised classification model. The proposed model is based on the concept of seeding training data in the Euclidean m-space (where m denotes the number of features) as hyper-rectangles. To express the exceptions, these hyper-rectangles may be nested inside one another to an arbitrary depth. The fast and one-shot learning procedures can adjust weights dynamically when new examples are added. Furthermore, the “second chance” heuristic is introduced in NHLM to avoid creating more memory objects than necessary. NHLM is applied to solving the land cover classification problem in Taiwan using remote sensed imagery. The study investigated five land cover classes and clouds. These six classes were chosen from field investigation of the study area according to previous study. Therefore, this paper aims to produce a land cover classification based on SPOT HRV spectral data. Compared with a standard back-propagation neural network (BPN), the experimental results indicate that NHLM provides a powerful tool for categorizing remote sensing data.

                In order to provide a remote sensing solution that would detect both the initial onset and monitor the early, as well as, the later stages of impact progression, changes in live leaf optical properties were compared along transects spanning impacted coastal Louisiana marsh sites. Green and red edge reflectance trends generally represented the early stages and fairly well the later stages of dieback progression, while blue and red reflectance and absorption trends represented the later stages of marsh impact that were most closely related to visible signs of marsh impact. Leaf reflectance in the near infrared (NIR) was not compatible with visual reflectance trends and did not co-vary with derived indicators of leaf water content, and thereby, water stress. Predicted from reflectance ratios, carotene tended to remain constant or increase relative to chlorophyll following noted changes in stressed plants at the two least impacted sites, while the pigments co-varied at the two most impacted sites. As an operational solution most amenable for satellite remote sensing, theNIR/red ratio followed blue and red reflectance trends while theNIR/green ratio mimicked the green and red edge reflectance trends indicating impact onset and progression, as well as, generally portraying blue and red reflectance trends indicating later stages of impact. The NIR/ green ratio magnitude and range generally increased from the most to least impacted site providing a convenient method to detect dieback onset and monitor dieback progression. This research demonstrated that remote sensing mapping at these sites could offer a more accurate perception of dieback severity distribution than offered by determinations relying on visible indicators of marsh changes.

                This paper compares three methods for removing non-ground measurements from airborne laser scanning data. These methods, including the elevation threshold with expanding window (ETEW), maximum local slope (MLS), and progressive morphological (PM) filters, analyze data points based on variations of local slope, and elevation. Low and high-relief data sets with various densities of trees, houses, and sand dunes were selected to test the filtering methods. The results show that all three methods can effectively remove most non-ground points in both low-relief urban and high-relief forested areas. The PM filter generated the best result in coastal barrier island areas, whereas the other algorithms tended to remove the tops of steep sand dunes. Each method experienced various omission or commission errors, depending on the filtering parameters. Topographic slope is the most sensitive parameter for the three filtering methods.

                Image registration is concerned with the problem of how to combine data and/or information from multiple sensors in order to achieve improved accuracies and better inference about the environment than could be attained through the use of a single sensor. Registration of imagery and information from multiple sources is essential for a variety of applications in remote sensing, medical diagnosis, computer vision, and pattern recognition. In general, an image registration methodology must deal with four issues. First, a decision has to be made regarding the choice of primitives for the registration procedure. The second issue is concerned with establishing the registration transformation function that mathematically relates geometric attributes of corresponding primitives. Then, a similarity measure should be devised to ensure the correspondence of conjugate primitives. Finally, a matching strategy has to be designed and implemented as a controlling framework that utilizes the primitives, the similarity measure, and the transformation function to solve the registration problem. This paper outlines a comprehensive investigation and implementation of the involved issues in a semi-automatic registration procedure capable of handling multi-source satellite imagery with varying geometric resolutions.

                This study presents an exemplar-based nested hyper-rectangle learning model (NHLM) which is an efficient and accurate supervised classification model. The proposed model is based on the concept of seeding training data in the Euclidean m-space (where m denotes the number of features) as hyper-rectangles. To express the exceptions, these hyper-rectangles may be nested inside one another to an arbitrary depth. The fast and one-shot learning procedures can adjust weights dynamically when new examples are added. Furthermore, the “second chance” heuristic is introduced in NHLM to avoid creating more memory objects than necessary. NHLM is applied to solving the land cover classification problem in Taiwan using remote sensed imagery. The study investigated five land cover classes and clouds. These six classes were chosen from field investigation of the study area according to previous study. Therefore, this paper aims to produce a land cover classification based on SPOT HRV spectral data. Compared with a standard back-propagation neural network (BPN), the experimental results indicate that NHLM provides a powerful tool for categorizing remote sensing data.
