                Automated processes in commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) systems are increasingly prevalent as new technology, and new knowledge is fused to enhance accessibility to spatial information. Automated terrain extraction is becoming a standard capability implemented into photogrammetric software. This paper focuses on digital surface model (DSM) generation from high-resolution satellite imagery (HRSI) using three COTS systems, SOCET SET®, Z/I Imaging, and Imagine®OrthoBASE, which each have their own image matching strategy. By generating DSMs of a test field diverse in land-cover, we assess the performance of the COTS terrain extraction methodologies. In checkpoints favorable to image matching, accuracy to a few meters in height can be achieved from COTS generated DSMs, however the isolated points are unlikely to be representative of the entire scene. Therefore, we look to alternative sources of control, such as the newly available DLR- and NASA-generated SRTM DEMs. A comparison to X-band SRTM DEMs demonstrated that height RMSE values range from 4 to 9 metres, though most of this uncertainty is attributed to the SRTM data.

                This study investigates the “pixel-swapping” optimization algorithm proposed by Atkinson for predicting subpixel land-cover distribution. Two limitations of this method are assessed: the arbitrary spatial range value and the arbitrary exponential model for characterizing spatial autocorrelation. Various alternative weighting functions are evaluated. For this assessment, two different simulation models are employed to develop spatially autocorrelated binary class raster maps. These rasters are then resampled to generate sets of representative medium-resolution class maps. Prior to conducting the subpixel allocation, the relationship between cell resolution and spatial autocorrelation, as measured by Moran’sI, is evaluated. It is discovered that the form of this relationship depends upon the simulation model. For all tested weighting functions (Nearest Neighbor, Gaussian, Exponential, and IDW), the pixel swapping method increased classification accuracy compared with the initial random allocation of subpixels. Nearest Neighbor allocation performs as well as the more complex models of spatial structure.

                High-resolution imaging satellites are a valuable and cost effective data acquisition tool for a variety of mapping and GIS applications such as topographic mapping, map updating, orthophoto generation, environmental monitoring, and change detection. Sensor modeling that describes the mathematical relationship between corresponding scene and object coordinates is a prerequisite procedure prior to manipulating the acquired imagery from such systems for mapping purposes. Rigorous and approximate sensor models are the two alternatives for describing the mathematics of the involved imaging process. The former explicitly involves the internal and external characteristics of the imaging sensor to faithfully represent the geometry of the scene formation. On the other hand, approximate modeling can be divided into two categories. The first category simplifies the rigorous model after making some assumptions about the system’s trajectory and/or object space. Gupta and Hartley’s model, parallel projection, self-calibrating direct linear transformation, and modified parallel projection are examples of this category. Other approximate models are based on empirical formulation of the scene-to-ground mathematical relationship. This category includes among others, the well-known Rational Function Model (RFM). This paper addresses several aspects of sensor modeling. Namely, it deals with the expected accuracy from rigorous modeling of imaging satellites as it relates to the number of available ground control points, comparative analysis of approximate and rigorous sensor models, robustness of the reconstruction process against biases in the available sensor characteristics, and impact of incorporating multi-source imagery in a single triangulation mechanism. Following a brief theoretical background, these issues will be presented through experimental results from real datasets captured by satellite and aerial imaging platforms.

                Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) systems supply a massive amount points in 3D space with no semantic information helping knowing the objects they represent. To identify points that were reflected from the terrain, numerous algorithms have been developed in recent years. Many of them apply local operators that tend to face difficulties with complex scenes while their performance also varies between landscapes. In this paper, we present a filtering method that integrates a global approach using orthogonal polynomials with a local one that is region-based. The algorithm makes use of only a few parameters, and no fine-tuning is required between landscapes. Applying the algorithm over areas with varying topography and objects such as bridges, tunnels, and complex building, shows an improved performance compared to results obtained by others. This improvement is reflected in a lower than usual rate of misclassification errors for data acquired over different landscapes.

            Line-of-Sight Vector Adjustment Model for Geopositioning of SPOT-5 Stereo Images

                We formulate and present a new geopositioning method for SPOT-5 High-Resolution Geometric (HRG) stereo images, named the line-of-sight (LOS) vector adjustment model. It is applicable to satellites that move along a well-defined close-to-circular elliptical orbit with a predicted orbit close to true. SPOT-5 satisfies these requirements because it has the improved capability of providing accurate satellite attitude and a look angle for each detector. The method’s core idea is that only the LOS vector was adjusted when correcting the geometric distortion of SPOT-5 imagery. One advantage of this method is that it achieves high geopositioning accuracy with a limited number of ground control points (GCPs). Although a minimum of three GCPs is needed for processing, a test result satisfied the accuracy requirement within one pixel of a SPOT-5 panchromatic image even with only three GCPs. The performance in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) improved as the number of GCPs increased. Five GCPs were found to be the optimal number in the practical application of the LOS vector adjustment model. Using five GCPs, the RMSEs were 0.48 m and 0.64 m in planimetry and height, respectively. The test results indicate that the proposed method is superior to the bundle adjustment method for the geopositioning of SPOT-5 HRG stereo images.

            Orthophoto Generation from Unorganized Point Clouds

                The reconstruction of realistic precise surfaces is required in many different applications. To date, terrestrial laser scanning offers 3D input data which are suitable for surface generation but are lacking in photo-realistic appearance. Texture for scanned surfaces can be provided by orthophotos generated from photographs that are acquired from almost the same viewpoint as the incident laser beam. However, the creation of an orthophoto using typical photogrammetric procedures requires the representation of the scanned surface with a triangulated mesh which cannot be created automatically in all cases. In this paper, a new method for automatic orthophoto generation from unorganized point clouds is presented. In the proposed methodology, the acquisition of accurate height information is directly derived from the point cloud without the prior requirement of a triangulated mesh. Analysis of experimental data with large height variations demonstrates the success of the algorithm which produces an orthophoto in near real-time. Issues on the performance of the method are also discussed.

                This paper presents a wavelet transformation-based method for fusing high-resolution satellite images. First, a multi-band wavelet fusion method, specifically the four-band wavelet method, is proposed for fusing one-meter panchromatic and four-meter multi-spectral Ikonos images. Second, the fusion experiments are undertaken by using the proposed four-band wavelet method. The results are compared with fused images from other methods, such as two-band wavelet andIHSmethods. The results are evaluated based on both visual evaluation and a quantitative analysis, by using several assessing parameters and a new evaluation method: the profile intensity curve. Third, as an application of the fused images, they are applied for recognition and identification of features in urban area. The quantitative analysis demonstrates that four-band wavelet transformation method provides improved fused images.
