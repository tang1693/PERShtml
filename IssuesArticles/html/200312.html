                Overlapping coverage of Landsat imagery at high latitudes is examined systematically and quantitatively. The Earth is separated into “row strips” aligned with the Landsat World Reference System (WRS), and the multi-scene coverage of Landsat imagery is divided into three types of areas: extended, missing, and overlap. Varying image orientation and narrowing row-strip width with increasing latitude are shown to have major impacts on these three areas. The dependencies of these coverage areas on skipping image collections from adjacent paths are calculated. This forms the basis for sampling strategies that can significantly reduce the number of images required to obtain full ground coverage at high latitudes. The calculations show that Antarctica can be covered with approximately one-third the total number of scene opportunities.

                This research study showed the potential of block bundle adjustment with nadir viewing sensor images, such as Landsat 7 ETM+. The method is based on the 3D analytical geometric model developed for multisensor images at the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, Natural Resources Canada. Different block sizes and configurations were tested and compared using an image bundle adjustment. The different tests using 15 Landsat 7 ETM+ images (five paths and three rows) acquired over a study site in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, showed that the same results (around 25-m errors) could be obtained with image blocks as with a single image using a largely reduced number of ground control points (GCPs). However, the combined image measurement and map errors of GCPs were included in the final error budget, and the internal accuracy of the blocks should be better (around one pixel or less). The number of GCPs to be used depended mainly on the cartographic data accuracy: more GCPs than the minimum required reduced the error propagation in the least-squares block bundle adjustment. In addition, tie points with a known elevation value (elevation tie points, ETPs) instead of normal tie points were used to link the adjacent images/strips (north-south and east-west) because the viewing-angle differences of overlapping images were smaller than 1° in north-south overlaps and around 10° in east-west overlaps. Better and more consistent results were also obtained using strips of images in the blocks acquired from the same orbit and date instead of using independent images. Finally, using only GCPs in the outer strips/images and ETPs in each overlap achieved the same results (25-m errors).

            Line-Based Modified Iterated Hough Transform for Autonomous Single-Photo Resection

                Automatic single photo resection (SPR) remains to be one of the challenging problems in digital photogrammetry. Earlier attempts to automate the space resection task were mainly point-based, where image-point primitives are first extracted and matched with their object counterparts. The matched primitives are then used to estimate the exterior orientation parameters (EOP). However, visibility and uniqueness of distinct control points in the input imagery limit robust automation of the pose estimation procedure. Recent advances in digital photogrammetry mandate adopting higher-level primitives such as control linear features replacing traditional control points. Linear features can be automatically extracted in image space. On the other hand, object-space control linear features can be extracted from an existing GIS layer containing3Dvector data such as a road network and/or terrestrial mobile mapping systems (MMS). In this paper, we present a line-based approach for simultaneously determining the position and attitude of the involved imagery as well as establishing the correspondence between image- and object-space features. This approach is motivated by the fact that captured imagery over a man-made environment is rich in straight-line segments. Moreover, free-form linear features can be reliably represented with sufficient accuracy by a sequence of straight-line segments (i.e., polylines). The suggested methodology starts by establishing a general mathematical model for relating conjugate straight-line segments to the EOP of the image under consideration. Then, a Modified Iterated Hough Transform (MIHT) strategy is adopted to derive the correspondence between image and object primitives as well as the position and the attitude of the involved imagery. This approach does not necessitate having one-to-one correspondence between image- and object-space primitives, which makes it robust against changes and/or discrepancies between the primitives. The parameter estimation and matching processes follow an optimum sequential procedure, which depends on the sensitivity of the mathematical model, relating corresponding primitives with different orientation at various image regions, to incremental changes in the EOP. Experimental results using real data proved the feasibility and robustness of the proposed approach even in the presence of a large percentage of outliers and/or discrepancies between the image-and object-space features.

                In the absence of sensor calibration and satellite orbit information for Ikonos satellite imagery, empirical methods have to be adopted for the geometric correction of the images. This paper addresses two major terrain related issues. First, the paper focuses on the effects of terrain variation on the rectification accuracy of Ikonos images using various two-dimensional (2D) transformation models. It was found that (1) the accuracy of rectified coordinates is significantly affected by elevation differences—the greater the differences, the lower the rectified accuracy; (2) for higher accuracy results, ground control points (GCPs) should be projected to a compensation plane before 2D transformation models are applied; and (3) an accuracy of about 0.5 m RMS error can be gained from rectified Ikonos images by utilizing most 2D transformation models when accurate ground control points are available.Second, the paper addresses the effects of terrain variation and the number of GCPs on the obtained ground points accuracy when an eight-parameter affine model is used for 3D ground points determination for stereoscopic Ikonos imagery. It was found that (1) non-collinearity-based 3D orientation and triangulation model can be used successfully in most cases for 3D ground point determination without the need for a camera model or satellite ephemeris data; (2) accuracy up to the sub-pixel level in the X-Y directions and about one pixel in the Z direction can be achieved; (3) the model works significantly better for hilly and mountainous areas than very flat areas; and (4) the accuracy of the results can be improved significantly either by increasing the number of GCPs or by adding topographic constraints.

            Comparison of Digital Elevation Models for Aquatic Data Development

                Thirty-meter digital elevation models (DEMs) produced by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) are widely available and commonly used in analyzing aquatic systems. However, these DEMs are of relatively coarse resolution, were inconsistently produced (i.e., Level 1 versus Level 2 DEMs), and lack drainage enforcement. Such issues may hamper efforts to accurately model streams, delineate hydrologic units (HUs), and classify slope. Thus, the Coastal Landscape Analysis and Modeling Study (CLAMS) compared streams, HUs, and slope classes generated from sample 10-meter drainage-enforced (DE) DEMs and 30-meter DEMs. We found that (1) drainage enforcement improved the spatial accuracy of streams and HU boundaries more than did increasing resolution from 30 meters to 10 meters, particularly in flatter terrain; (2) streams and HU boundaries were generally more accurate when delineated with Level 2 than with Level 1 30-meter DEMs; and (3) the 10-meter DE-DEMs better represented both higher and lower slope classes. These findings prompted us to have 10-meter DE-DEMs produced for the Coast Range Province of Oregon, increased confidence in CLAMS outputs from the 10-meter DE-DEMs, and should benefit others interested in using DEMs for aquatic analyses.

                In recent decades, rapid rates of population growth and urban expansion have led to widespread conversion of natural ecosystems and agricultural lands to urban land cover. The amount and rate of this land conversion affects local and regional ecosystems, climate, biogeochemistry, as well as food production. The main objective of the research described in this paper is to improve understanding of the methodological and validation requirements for mapping urban land cover over large areas from coarse resolution remotely sensed data. A technique called boosting is used to improve supervised classification accuracy and provides a means to integrate MODIS data with the DMSP nighttime lights data set and gridded population data. Results for North America indicate that fusion of these three data types improves urban classification results by resolving confusion between urban and other classes that occurs when any one of the data sets is used by itself. Traditional measures of accuracy assessment as well as new, maplet-based methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology for creating maps of cities at continental scales.

                Two nationwide land-cover mapping efforts, the GAP Analysis Program (GAP) and the USGS National Land Cover Data (NLCD) program, address the need for intermediate-scale land-cover information to support a diverse user community. The data sets are comparable, but have different objectives, classification systems, and methodologies. A comparative analysis of the GAP and NLCD data sets is needed throughout the United States to determine their relative strengths and limitations and better inform the user community of their applicability for various applications. This study conducted comparative analyses of the GAP and NLCD data sets for Kansas. The data sets were generalized to a common set of land-cover classes, and pixel-level comparisons were made at the state and ecoregion levels. The GAP and NLCD had an overall classification agreement of 67 percent at the state level, with most of the classification disagreement occurring between cropland and grassland. The cropland area classified by GAP was comparable to cropland area estimates reported by the USDA, while NLCD appeared to underestimate cropland and overestimate grassland. The single-date/multiple-data source classification approach and the sub-optimal early-spring dates of Landsat TM data used to produce NLCD resulted in substantial confusion in cropland-grassland discrimination. The multiple-date classification approach used by Kansas GAP provided better discrimination of most land-cover classes. Some classification disagreement, however, was attributable to methodological differences between GAP and NLCD. Accuracy assessment found an overall accuracy of 87 percent for GAP and 81 percent for NLCD, and GAP had higher accuracies for most individual land-cover classes. The Kansas GAP and NLCD land-cover products were found to be comparable in terms of characterizing broad scale land-cover patterns, but the Kansas GAP land-cover map appears to be more appropriate for localized applications that require detailed and accurate land-cover information.

                GIS-based measurements that combine native raster and native vector data are commonly used in environmental assessments. Most of these measurements can be calculated using either raster or vector data formats and processing methods. Raster processes are more commonly used because they can be significantly faster computationally than vector, but error is introduced in converting vector data to raster. This conversion error has been widely studied and quantified, but the impact on environmental assessment results has not been investigated. We examined four GIS-based measurements commonly used in environmental assessments for approximately 1000 watersheds in the state of Maryland and Washington, D.C. Each metric was calculated using vector and raster methods, and estimated values were compared using a paired t-test, Spearman rank correlation, and cluster analyses. Paired t-tests were used to determine the statistical significance of quantitative differences between methods, and Spearman rank correlation and cluster analyses were used to evaluate the impact of the differences on environmental assessments. Paired t-test results indicated significant quantitative differences between methods for three of the four metrics. However, Spearman ranks and cluster analyses indicated that the quantitative differences would not affect environmental assessment results. Spearman rank correlations between vector and raster values were greater than 0.98 for all comparisons. Cluster analyses resulted in identical assignment for 88 percent to over 98 percent of watersheds analyzed among vector and various raster methods.
