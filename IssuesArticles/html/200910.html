                Airborne lidar systems have come to be extensively used in photogrammetry and mapping sciences. In this paper, a high-quality simulation approach and methods of small-footprint lidar processing are presented and discussed, validated for tree height estimation, and demonstrated for scanning geometry effects analysis and mobile mapping. The simulation method implemented combines both spatial and radiometric components to produce realistic waveform and point cloud data for system performance analysis and for algorithm development for lidar data processing and mapping purposes. Waveform data generated by the simulator were shown to demonstrate the possibilities of such an approach in system and data verification. As the related empirical data are insufficient for effective research and exploitation in mapping purposes at the moment, the simulated waveform data are needed.A tree location accuracy of 15 cm and tree height underestimation of 0.33 m was found using the simulation model for the TopEye Mk II laser scanner, compared to the artificial forest model reference data. Modeling of light interaction on object surfaces and characteristics of scanning systems provide an opportunity to simulate laser data acquisition of well-defined objects under controlled conditions. By eliminating different sources of error case-by-case, we can improve the knowledge obtained merely from the experimental studies.Data validation in the scanning geometry simulations was carried out by comparing the simulated first echo data to the environment model and, separately, to the first echo data from an independent TopoSys II flight strip that was not used for the environment model computation. The mean differences reveal that the simulator slightly overestimates the object elevations. Deviation between the real TopoSys point cloud and the environmental model was 2 to 3 times larger than that obtained for the simulated Optech and TopoSys data sets.We believe that the developed simulation and modeling is an efficient tool for determining the most reasonable set of flight parameters for any current mapping task, for analyzing change detection possibilities of repeated laser surveys, and for studying and verifying future lidar systems and concepts. However, this requires high-quality modeling of the system and extensive knowledge of the interaction between the laser beam and the object, which should be further developed in the coming years.

Seven Landsat and ASTER images acquired on summer mornings between 1998 and 2005 were processed. For each image LST was examined for urban and rural areas, and the main land-cover types, and then correlated with vegetation cover, soil moisture content, and albedo. At the time of data acquisition, the warmer conditions of the dry and poorly vegetated land-covers of the northern rural valley result in a negative SUHI intensity. Meanwhile, the colder conditions of the moist and well vegetated land-covers of the southern rural valley result in a positive SUHI intensity. The strong correlation coefficients retrieved between the above mentioned parameters for the rural area, support the wide thermal range associated with it, which is influenced by the high warming rate of its dry and poorly vegetated landcovers.

            A Wavelet and IHS Integration Method to Fuse High Resolution SAR with Moderate Resolution Multispectral Images

                Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging can be a feasible alternative or a complement to traditional optical remote sensing techniques because it does not depend on solar illumination and weather conditions. The high spatial resolution of SAR, such as the Intermap STAR-3i airborne SAR image with 1.25 m spatial resolution, makes it applicable for high spatial resolution mapping purposes. However, difficulties sometimes exist in the interpretation of SAR images. Image fusion presents an alternative to improve the interpretability of SAR images by fusing the color information from moderate spatial resolution multispectral (MS) images. In this paper, a new fusion method based on the integration of wavelet transform and IHS (Intensity, Hue, and Saturation) transform is proposed for SAR and MS fusion to maintain the spectral content of the original MS image while retaining the spatial detail of the high-resolution SAR image. Three data sets are used to evaluate the proposed fusion method: two sets are airborne SAR images with MS images at different spatial resolutions; the other set is a Radarsat image with a Landsat TM image. The fusion results are evaluated visually and statistically. The evaluation shows that successful results are achieved in the fusion of all SAR and MS images from a variety of sensors with significant spatial and spectral variations by using the proposed image fusion method.

            Spectral Distance Decay

                Remotely sensed data represents key information for character-izing and estimating biodiversity. Spectral distance among sites has proven to be a powerful approach for detecting species composition variability. Regression analysis of species similarity versus spectral distance may allow us to quantitatively estimate how beta-diversity in species changes with respect to spectral and ecological variability. In classical regression analysis, the residual sum of squares is minimized for the mean of the dependent variable distribution. However, many ecological datasets are characterized by a high number of zeroes that can add noise to the regression model. Quantile regression can be used to evaluate trend in the upper quantiles rather than a mean trend across the whole distribution of the dependent variable. In this paper, we used ordinary least square (OLS) and quantile regression to estimate the decay of species similarity versus spectral distance. The achieved decay rates were statistically nonzero (p < 0.05) considering both OLS and quantile regression. Nonetheless, OLS regression estimate of mean decay rate was only half the decay rate indicated by the upper quantiles. Moreover, the intercept value, representing the similarity reached when spectral distance approaches zero, was very low compared with the intercepts of upper quantiles, which detected high species similarity when habitats are more similar. In this paper we demonstrated the power of using quantile regressions applied to spectral distance decay in order to reveal species diversity patterns otherwise lost or underestimated by ordinary least square regression.

            Synchronicity between Satellite-Measured Leaf Phenology and Rainfall Regimes in Tropical Forests

                The seasonal and interannual cycles of the canopy phenology of Hawaiian tropical ecosystems were extracted from seven-year MODIS VI data. NDVI responded sensitively to surface greenness of dry-to-mesic ecosystems, but it showed little change as mean annual precipitation (MAP) surpassed 2,000 mm. Canopy greenness seasonality was strongest in dry areas, and its strength had an inverse relationship with MAP (r = -0.75, P < 0.0001). Study results report that the photosynthetic activity of dry biomes responded synchronously to annual rainfall patterns. As MAP increased, the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) had significant variations among wet biomes, and its canopy greenness cycles lagged behind seasonal rainfall cycles. As a result, greenness peaks of dry-to-mesic environments occurred in the wet season, whereas those of wet environments (MAP > 2,000 mm) occurred in the dry season. This result leads to a conclusion that forest productivity of perhumid environments may be limited by reduced solar hours.

                Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging can be a feasible alternative or a complement to traditional optical remote sensing techniques because it does not depend on solar illumination and weather conditions. The high spatial resolution of SAR, such as the Intermap STAR-3i airborne SAR image with 1.25 m spatial resolution, makes it applicable for high spatial resolution mapping purposes. However, difficulties sometimes exist in the interpretation of SAR images. Image fusion presents an alternative to improve the interpretability of SAR images by fusing the color information from moderate spatial resolution multispectral (MS) images. In this paper, a new fusion method based on the integration of wavelet transform and IHS (Intensity, Hue, and Saturation) transform is proposed for SAR and MS fusion to maintain the spectral content of the original MS image while retaining the spatial detail of the high-resolution SAR image. Three data sets are used to evaluate the proposed fusion method: two sets are airborne SAR images with MS images at different spatial resolutions; the other set is a Radarsat image with a Landsat TM image. The fusion results are evaluated visually and statistically. The evaluation shows that successful results are achieved in the fusion of all SAR and MS images from a variety of sensors with significant spatial and spectral variations by using the proposed image fusion method.

                Remotely sensed data represents key information for character-izing and estimating biodiversity. Spectral distance among sites has proven to be a powerful approach for detecting species composition variability. Regression analysis of species similarity versus spectral distance may allow us to quantitatively estimate how beta-diversity in species changes with respect to spectral and ecological variability. In classical regression analysis, the residual sum of squares is minimized for the mean of the dependent variable distribution. However, many ecological datasets are characterized by a high number of zeroes that can add noise to the regression model. Quantile regression can be used to evaluate trend in the upper quantiles rather than a mean trend across the whole distribution of the dependent variable. In this paper, we used ordinary least square (OLS) and quantile regression to estimate the decay of species similarity versus spectral distance. The achieved decay rates were statistically nonzero (p < 0.05) considering both OLS and quantile regression. Nonetheless, OLS regression estimate of mean decay rate was only half the decay rate indicated by the upper quantiles. Moreover, the intercept value, representing the similarity reached when spectral distance approaches zero, was very low compared with the intercepts of upper quantiles, which detected high species similarity when habitats are more similar. In this paper we demonstrated the power of using quantile regressions applied to spectral distance decay in order to reveal species diversity patterns otherwise lost or underestimated by ordinary least square regression.

                The seasonal and interannual cycles of the canopy phenology of Hawaiian tropical ecosystems were extracted from seven-year MODIS VI data. NDVI responded sensitively to surface greenness of dry-to-mesic ecosystems, but it showed little change as mean annual precipitation (MAP) surpassed 2,000 mm. Canopy greenness seasonality was strongest in dry areas, and its strength had an inverse relationship with MAP (r = -0.75, P < 0.0001). Study results report that the photosynthetic activity of dry biomes responded synchronously to annual rainfall patterns. As MAP increased, the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) had significant variations among wet biomes, and its canopy greenness cycles lagged behind seasonal rainfall cycles. As a result, greenness peaks of dry-to-mesic environments occurred in the wet season, whereas those of wet environments (MAP > 2,000 mm) occurred in the dry season. This result leads to a conclusion that forest productivity of perhumid environments may be limited by reduced solar hours.
