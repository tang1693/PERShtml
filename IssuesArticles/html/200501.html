                Common thematic map accuracy measures (e.g., error matrix and kappa coefficient) are inadequate for analyzing the spatial variation of thematic map accuracy. This paper presents a method of mapping spatial accuracy of thematic land cover maps using fuzzy sets. First, we define a multilevel agreement between reference data and corresponding pixels on the map. Next, we formulate a discrete, multi-level agreement fuzzy set regarding a particular land-cover type for each pixel on the map. Then, we construct spatial accuracy maps based on information from the multi-level agreement fuzzy sets. We illustrate the method by constructing accuracy maps of several land cover types for the Mid-Atlantic Regionregion. Results show that thematic map accuracy is not spatially homogenous, but varies across a landscape and different land cover types having different spatial patterns of accuracy. The method provides valuable information about thematic map accuracy for both scientists and decision makers, such as in designing adaptive sampling schemes, deriving landscape indicators, or thematic map-based modeling.

                To ensure the safety of the national airspace system, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) oversees surveying programs with the goal of geolocating vertical features that penetrate 3D Obstruction Identification Surfaces (OIS) around airfields. These OIS are defined mathematically and are based on the layout of the runways, the types of electronic navigation equipment used for each runway, and other factors. Under a series of interagency agreements, the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) is tasked with supplying obstruction survey data to the FAA.Airport obstruction surveys have traditionally been conducted using a combination of photogrammetry and conventional field survey techniques. In this study, we investigate the use of airborne laser scanning technology for this application. Specifically, we examine the effects of varying the forward look angle, laser footprint, flying height, flying speed, scan angle, scan frequency, transmitted power, and receiver sensitivity, as these parameters relate to the detection and measurement of vertical obstructions. We present results of test flights over the Gainesville Regional Airport (GNV) using fourteen different configurations of an Optech ALTM 2050. The results are compared to field-surveyed obstruction data obtained by NGS. Our analysis shows that certain configurations of the airborne laser scanning system notably improve the detection of obstructions. In this study, the best results were obtained using a 20Â° forward tilt angle and a 0.2 milliradian beam divergence from a flying height of 750 m. With this configuration, all obstructions were detected and the vertical accuracy (RMSE) was 0.88 m when compared to the field-surveyed obstructions.

                A variety of indices have been proposed to facilitate the quantitative analysis in remote sensing applications. The assessment of land development is important for minimizing development impacts and formulating alternative development plans. Much attention has been paid to the quantity of land use changes in general development assessment using remote sensing. However, additional information can be obtained from remote sensing and GIS for revealing land use problems more effectively. This paper presents four indicators, quantity, quality, location, and morphology to characterize land development patterns for fast-growing regions. A four-component efficiency index is further developed for ranking purposes to reflect economic and environmental considerations. The implementation of the method has been demonstrated in a fast-growing region in south China. Efforts have been made to verify the model with independent empirical data.

            The Performance of Fuzzy Operators on Fuzzy Classification of Urban Land Covers

                The research discussed in this paper evaluates the performance of selected fuzzy operators (e.g., maximum, minimum, algebraic sum, algebraic product, and gamma operators) for integrating fuzzy membership values associated with multiple spectral bands for mapping the complex spatial mixture that characterises urban land covers. Accordingly, a supervised classification approach based on the fuzzy c-means algorithm was implemented to generate fuzzy memberships of selected bands (1, 3, 4 and 7) of a Landsat-7 ETM+ image that provided the highest spectral separability among different urban land covers (e.g., forest, grassland, urban, and dense urban) as determined by a transformed divergence analysis. Maps resulting from the application of each fuzzy operator were evaluated against field data. The results show that the fuzzy algebraic product and the fuzzy gamma operators (0.1 to 0.8) are optimal for integrating the fuzzy memberships of selected urban land covers on multi-band data sets, as they exhibited a Khat statistic of 75 percent as compared to a Khat statistic of 59 percent, 64 percent and 71 percent for maximum, minimum and fuzzy algebraic sum, respectively.

            Augmenting Grid-Based Contours to Improve Thin-Plate DEM Generation

                We present two new pre-processing techniques that improve thin plate Digital Elevation Model (DEM) approximations from grid-based contour data. One method computes gradients from an initial interpolated or approximated surface. The aspects are used to create gradient paths that are interpolated using Catmull-Rom splines. The computed elevations are added to the initial contour data set. Thin plate methods are applied to all of the data. The splines allow information to flow across contours, improving the final surface. The second method successively computes new, intermediate contours in between existing isolines, which provide additional data for subsequent thin plate processing. Both methods alleviate artifacts visible in previous thin plate methods. The surfaces are tested with published methods to show qualitative and quantitative improvements over previous methods.

                The checking of the geometric accuracy of orthoimages and digital elevation models (DEMS) is discussed. As a reference, an existing orthoimage and a second orthoimage derived from an overlapping aerial image, are used. The proposed automated procedures for checking the orthoimages and DEMs are based on matching of corresponding image patches. Existing topographic databases are additionally used in order to select time-invariant objects as checkpoints. In order to avoid blunders in the correlation, thresholds for similarity measures are applied. Detailed studies show that a combination of thresholds for the maximum correlation coefficient, the average mutual information, and distance can reduce the number of blunders in the automated measurements considerably and should therefore be applied. The calculation of DEM errors is carried out by an improved formula. The new methods and procedures are applied to two practical examples, and the results are presented.

                Due to the 10-bit design of SEAWIFS instrument and the signal transmission, many SEAWIFS satellite images are expected to have lower digitization noise and corrupted impulse noise. In this paper, we first analyze the characteristics of impulse noise and propose a new rank-ordered filter based on the difference of sequence for mean/standard, which is named as Statistical Ratio Rank Ordered Differences (SRROD) filter. Second, we describe the impulse noise detection and removal algorithm in detail. Compared with the median filter and other existing filters, the SRROD filter could effectively remove impulse noises while preserving other valid pixels without, or only with minor, modification. Through adjusting the lower and upper threshold values, different filter performance could be achieved. We also discuss the blind parameters optimization for non-recursive implementation. Based on the assessment of the distribution map of performance estimator Îµ according to different lower and upper threshold pairs, a nearly optimal threshold could be obtained. Finally, some concluding remarks are also presented in this paper.

                This paper studies the photogrammetric mapping properties and capabilities of the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) mapping data. Starting from the raw MGS data, we decompress the MOC narrow angle images, extract, and calculate their exterior orientation from the SPICE kernels, and calculate the 3D coordinates of MOLA footprints from MOLA PEDR files. A new approach is proposed that registers a MOLA profile to stereo MOC images over the same area with robust and faster convergence. Intersection is conducted to determine the 3D positions of image points measured on MOC stereo pairs. It is shown that there is a nearly constant uncertainty of one MOLA ground spacing distance (approximately 325 m) along the flight direction in MOC and MOLA registration. This is caused by the uncertainties in SPICE kernels, MOLA points, and the determination of time tags for MOC scan lines, which possibly constitutes the dominant error source for the registration. Intersection calculation reaches an optimal balance by distributing the uncertainty evenly in the two images of a stereo pair. As for the photogrammetric mapping capabilities, an uncertainty of 180.8 m in planimetric distance and 30.8 m in elevation difference is estimated. A number of numerical and graphic results over three of the selected candidate landing sites for the Mars Exploration Rover mission are presented for analysis and illustration.
