                This study proposes a new method for repeated structure detection and the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of building façades from mobile lidar data. Firstly, the building façade is divided and unrolled to simplify the complex façade structures, improving the automation of structure detection and building reconstruction. Subsequently, the unrolled façade is decomposed into tiles by analyzing the repeated structures. Tiles with strong similarities are matched and merged to restore the imperfect façade points. Based on the restored points and repeated structures, a 3D building façade can be reconstructed with a complete structure and fine detail. An analysis is conducted to compare the constructed 3D model with the lidar points of actual façade. The results of this analysis demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively deal with missing areas caused by occlusion, viewpoint limitation, and uneven point density, as well as realizing the highly complete 3D reconstruction of a building façade.

                A primary Landsat constraint is cloud contamination. The goal of this study is to evaluate how increasing Landsat temporal repeat frequency might achieve weekly cloud-free observations. This is a case study which examines eastern United States observations, as a typical representation of the temperate forest biome. A comparison between simultaneous Landsat and MODIS observations shows that MODIS observations provide a reasonable approximation of observed Landsat cloud cover conditions. Daily MODIS cloud observations are examined, using image compositing, to evaluate how increasing Landsat temporal repeat frequency might reduce weekly Landsat cloud contamination. Results suggests that for these eastern US locations weekly clear views are best achieved with daily satellite repeat frequency, bi-weekly clear views with 2-day repeat, monthly clear views are achieved with 4-day repeat and seasonal clear views with 8-day repeat. To more fully understand the global impact of cloud contamination on Landsat observations similar studies are needed for the Earth's other major biomes.

                Spatiotemporal complete sea surface temperature (SST) dataset with higher accuracy and resolution is desirable for many studies in atmospheric science and climate change. The purpose of this study is to establish the spatiotemporal data fusion model, the Hierarchical Bayesian Model (HBM) based on Robust Fixed Rank Filter (R-FRF), that merge Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) SST with 4-km resolution and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) SST with 25-km resolution through their spatiotemporal complementarity to obtain fusion SST with complete coverage, high spatial resolution, and fine spatial pattern. First, a bias correction model was applied to correct satellite SST. Second, a spatiotemporal model called R-FRF was established to model potential spatiotemporal process of SST. Third, the R-FRF model was embedded in the hierarchical Bayesian framework, and the corrected MODIS and AMSR-E SST are merged. Finally, the accuracy, spatial pattern and spatial completeness of the fusion SST were assessed. The results of this study are the following: (a) It is necessary to carry out bias correction before data fusion. (b) The R-FRF model could simulate SST spatiotemporal trend well. (c) Fusion SST has similar accuracy and spatial pattern to MODIS SST. Though the accuracy is lower than that of the AMSR-E SST, the fusion SST has more local detail information. The results indicated that fusion SST with higher accuracy, finer spatial pattern, and complete coverage can be obtained through HBM based on R-FRF. Index Terms: Hierarchical Bayesian Model based on R-FRF; MODIS SST; AMSR-E SST; scale transformation; local variance.

                To establish a basis for the utilization of lidar topography as a data source for coastal geomorphological analyses, this study generated statistical metrics of lidar error through the comparison of a June 2014 USGS collection of airborne lidar with a concurrently collected high-accuracy GPS topographical survey collected within the beach and dunes of a portion of Fire Island National Seashore. The examination of bare earth lidar error within the experiment site revealed a complex association between accuracy and environment within the coastal landscape. Accuracy was constrained to better than 50 cm RMSE in areas with vegetated dune topography and, overall, a 38.9 cm RMSE was measured. Higher accuracies were achieved in the flat, non-vegetated beach. A three-dimensional minimization of residuals between the lidar and GPS surveys reduced the total RMSE to 25.2 cm, indicating a correctable systematic offset between the surface generated from the lidar and the true ground surface.

                We monitored the spatio-temporal distribution of urban population-weighted ozone for 2014–2017 to investigate ground-level pollution in China. During the study period, the national average was 88.68±10.4 μg/m3for O3-8h, and 5.27% of the days that exceed the 160 μg/m3standard. Pollution hotspots in the Tibetan Plateau are mainly attributed to natural factors, while those in the North China Plain (NCP), Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and Pearl River Delta (PRD) are more closely related to anthropogenic activities. The results indicate that the ozone pollution and its correlations with the landscape are influenced by the ozone regime and climatic factors. In the Yangtze Plain and to its south, pollution in the ozone episodes is related to both population size and heterogeneity. For the Yangtze Plain and its southern urban areas in transitional ozone regimes, sprawl, contiguity, compactness, and the size of the urban area also facilitate the accumulation of pollution.
