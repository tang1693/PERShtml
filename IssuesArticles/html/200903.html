                Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) technology enables cost-effective rapid production of digital models that capture topography and vertical structures of surface features at a fine spatial resolution. The capability has promoted lidar applications for mapping terrain, buildings, forest stands, and coastal features that cannot be adequately captured by other remote sensing means over a large area. However, in complex terrain, lidar data and lidar-derived products may contain significant uncertainty. This research provides a simple method to assess the spatial uncertainty of lidar-derived building model, using downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma as an example. Results indicate that significant uncertainty could be found in urban environment where: (a) building structures are complex, (b) buildings are constructed with reflective materials, and (c) vegetation grows near-by. In addition, cities under rapid development also challenge the accuracy assessment of 3D building models. To conclude, we suggest: (a) careful pre-flight planning before data collection, (b) improve the feature extraction algorithm if possible, (c) use of other remote sensing data, and (d) accuracy assessment on suggested urban environments to reduce the spatial uncertainty of lidar data and lidar-derived products.

                Building reconstruction from lidar data offers promising prospects for rapid generation of large-scale 3D models autonomously. Such reconstruction requires knowledge on a variety of parameters that refer to both the point cloud and the modeled buildings. The complexity of the reconstruction task has led researchers to use external information to localize buildings and assume that they consist of only planar parts. These assumptions limit the reconstruction of complex buildings, particularly those having curved faces. We present in this paper a detection and reconstruction model that considers the point cloud as the only information source and supports the reconstruction of general shape surfaces. Nonetheless, since many of the buildings are composed of planar faces, we maintain the planar based partitioning whenever possible and model non-planar surfaces only where needed. This way, standard models are extended to support free-form roof shapes without imposing artificial models. In addition to the free-form surface extension, we demonstrate the effect of imposing geometric constraints on the reconstruction as a means to generate realistic building models.

                This study presents an adaptive solution to topographic feature extraction from digital terrain model. First, a slope map is produced by the proposed slope estimator that combines the well-known D8 and finite difference methods. In the second step, the Laplacian of Gaussian (LOG) operator with multiple thresholds is applied to the resultant slope map to determine edge pixels that have local maximum curvature and maximum connectivity. The third step adopts the original and robust marching square algorithms to trace the topographic features. Modification is made to selectively introduce shoulder points according to the local topographic complexity. In comparison to the existing algorithms, the performance of the proposed adaptive marching square algorithm is evaluated in terms of precision and resolution of the extracted features. Digital terrain models over three locations in Antarctica are used for this study. It is shown overall reducing 75 percent of the shoulder points from the robust algorithm will cause 24 percent precision drop in the adaptive method.

                The objective of this paper is to examine the scaling-up effect on the relationship between landscape patterns and land surface temperatures based on a case study of Indianapolis, United States. The integration of remote sensing, GIS, and landscape ecology methods was used in this study. Four TERRA ASTER images were acquired to derive the land-use and land-cover (LULC) patterns and land surface temperatures (LST) in different seasons. Each LULC and LST image was resampled to eight spatial scales: 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 250, 500, and 1,000 m. The scaling-up effect on the spatial and ecological characteristics of landscape patterns and LSTs were examined by the use of landscape metrics. Optimal spatial resolutions were determined on the basis of the minimum distance in the landscape metric spaces. The results show that the patch percentages of LULC and LST patches were not strongly affected by the scaling-up process in different seasons. The patch densities and landscape shape indices and LST patches kept decreasing across the scales without distinct seasonal differences. Thirty meters was found to be the optimal resolution in the study of the relationship between urban LULC and LST classes. Ninety meters was found to be the optimal spatial resolution for assessing the landscape-level relationship between LULC and LST patterns. This paper may provide useful information for urban planners and environmental practitioners to manage urban landscapes and urban thermal environments as a result of urbanization.

                Direct measurement of exterior orientation parameters has been a challenge in photogrammetry for many years. Direct sensor orientation using a calibrated GPS/INS system can potentially eliminate the need for ground control points and aerial triangulation, and consequently, result in a great reduction in the cost and time of aerial photogrammetry. Previous studies have shown that, compared to conventional aerial triangulation, direct sensor orientation yields larger errors in the image and object space. It has also been shown that including a number of tie points within an integrated orientation approach can result in a reduction of errors in the image space. In this paper, the influence of the number and distribution of tie points on integrated orientation is investigated. Experiments with various numbers of tie points regularly as well as randomly distributed are presented. Results indicate that an increase in the number of tie points up to one point per model results in a considerable reduction of the errors in the image space.

                Measurement error introduced by mismatches of scale and location between response and predictor variables is one of the major sources of error in forest structure mapping. It affects the evaluation of analytical models, compromises the results of accuracy assessments, and reduces the accuracy of mapping products. Using forest structure attributes measured in a specifically-designed ground plot system, we isolated the measurement error from the total mapping errors that are related to multiple factors, and examined the distribution and magnitude of this error caused by a scale mismatch between a relatively larger forest unit and a relatively smaller forest unit, as well as location mismatch of a specific distance between two forest units of the same size. We demonstrated the effects of measurement error on the analytical models and resulting maps for three common mapping scenarios linking ground data with remote sensing imagery. Our results indicated that this scale- and location-related error can be analyzed using the Classical and Berkson error models in most practical mapping exercises involving data measured on-ground and remotely-sensed imagery, and that the distinct error pattern of each type of measurement error can be used to identify the major error source. Based on this analysis, we can adjust the plot design or adjust the resolution of imagery, and select the optimal analytical method to achieve the best mapping result.

                Here we present a new method for using existing Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data to optimize performance of stereo-matching algorithms for digital topographic determination. We show that existing DEM data, even those of a poor quality (precision, resolution) can be used as a means of training stereo-matching algorithms to generate higher quality DEM data. Existing data are used to identify and to remove gross surface errors. We test the method using true vertical aerial imagery for a UK upland study site. Results demonstrate a dramatic improvement in data quality even where DEM data derived from topographic maps are adopted. Comparison with other methods suggests that using existingDEMdata improves error identification and correction significantly. Tests suggest that it is applicable to both archival and commissioned aerial imagery.

                The objective of this paper is to examine the scaling-up effect on the relationship between landscape patterns and land surface temperatures based on a case study of Indianapolis, United States. The integration of remote sensing, GIS, and landscape ecology methods was used in this study. Four TERRA ASTER images were acquired to derive the land-use and land-cover (LULC) patterns and land surface temperatures (LST) in different seasons. Each LULC and LST image was resampled to eight spatial scales: 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 250, 500, and 1,000 m. The scaling-up effect on the spatial and ecological characteristics of landscape patterns and LSTs were examined by the use of landscape metrics. Optimal spatial resolutions were determined on the basis of the minimum distance in the landscape metric spaces. The results show that the patch percentages of LULC and LST patches were not strongly affected by the scaling-up process in different seasons. The patch densities and landscape shape indices and LST patches kept decreasing across the scales without distinct seasonal differences. Thirty meters was found to be the optimal resolution in the study of the relationship between urban LULC and LST classes. Ninety meters was found to be the optimal spatial resolution for assessing the landscape-level relationship between LULC and LST patterns. This paper may provide useful information for urban planners and environmental practitioners to manage urban landscapes and urban thermal environments as a result of urbanization.

                Direct measurement of exterior orientation parameters has been a challenge in photogrammetry for many years. Direct sensor orientation using a calibrated GPS/INS system can potentially eliminate the need for ground control points and aerial triangulation, and consequently, result in a great reduction in the cost and time of aerial photogrammetry. Previous studies have shown that, compared to conventional aerial triangulation, direct sensor orientation yields larger errors in the image and object space. It has also been shown that including a number of tie points within an integrated orientation approach can result in a reduction of errors in the image space. In this paper, the influence of the number and distribution of tie points on integrated orientation is investigated. Experiments with various numbers of tie points regularly as well as randomly distributed are presented. Results indicate that an increase in the number of tie points up to one point per model results in a considerable reduction of the errors in the image space.

                Measurement error introduced by mismatches of scale and location between response and predictor variables is one of the major sources of error in forest structure mapping. It affects the evaluation of analytical models, compromises the results of accuracy assessments, and reduces the accuracy of mapping products. Using forest structure attributes measured in a specifically-designed ground plot system, we isolated the measurement error from the total mapping errors that are related to multiple factors, and examined the distribution and magnitude of this error caused by a scale mismatch between a relatively larger forest unit and a relatively smaller forest unit, as well as location mismatch of a specific distance between two forest units of the same size. We demonstrated the effects of measurement error on the analytical models and resulting maps for three common mapping scenarios linking ground data with remote sensing imagery. Our results indicated that this scale- and location-related error can be analyzed using the Classical and Berkson error models in most practical mapping exercises involving data measured on-ground and remotely-sensed imagery, and that the distinct error pattern of each type of measurement error can be used to identify the major error source. Based on this analysis, we can adjust the plot design or adjust the resolution of imagery, and select the optimal analytical method to achieve the best mapping result.

                Here we present a new method for using existing Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data to optimize performance of stereo-matching algorithms for digital topographic determination. We show that existing DEM data, even those of a poor quality (precision, resolution) can be used as a means of training stereo-matching algorithms to generate higher quality DEM data. Existing data are used to identify and to remove gross surface errors. We test the method using true vertical aerial imagery for a UK upland study site. Results demonstrate a dramatic improvement in data quality even where DEM data derived from topographic maps are adopted. Comparison with other methods suggests that using existingDEMdata improves error identification and correction significantly. Tests suggest that it is applicable to both archival and commissioned aerial imagery.
