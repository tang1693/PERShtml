                Remote sensing techniques can provide information on habitat quality, biodiversity, and cover change at the regional scales of sagebrush-steppe dominated systems and with the repeatability necessary for resource management. In this paper, we present the results of multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis applied to Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) imagery, comparing affects of seasonality and spectral resolution on the discrimination of soil, grass/forb, and sagebrush abundance in Yellowstone National Park. Our results showed that AVIRIS, despite late season phenology, correlated well with herbaceous and sagebrush cover field measurements (R2= 0.77 and 0.75, respectively), utilizing high spectral resolution to separate soils from vegetation. However, ASTER-derived values during peak green correlated best with field measurements (0.75 and 0.78). These results demonstrated an effective method to monitor semi-arid regions with readily available imagery and highlight applications for future hyperspectral satellite missions.

                Relating less directly to the physical reflectance from remote sensors, land-use analysis is comparably more challenging than land-cover studies, especially for residential land-uses. This research presents an object-oriented approach to detect residential land use of buildings directly from lidar data, aerial photography, and road maps to enhance urban land-use analysis. Specifically, the proposed methodology applies a multi-directional ground filter to generate a bare ground surface from lidar data, then uses a morphology-based building detection algorithm to identify buildings from lidar and aerial photographs, and finally separates residential buildings using a supervised C4.5 decision tree analysis based on seven land-use characteristics of buildings. Experiments based on the 8.25 km2study site located in Austin, Texas proved the possibility and efficiency of directly detecting and identifying residential buildings from remote sensing images with 81.1 percent of residential buildings correctly classified.

                Estimating the contribution of forests to carbon sequestration is commonly done by applying forest growth models. Such models inherently use field observations, such as leaf area index (LAI), whereas relevant information is also available from remotely sensed images. The purpose of this study is to improve the LAI estimated from the Physiological Principles Predicting Growth (3-PG) model by combining its output with LAI derived from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) satellite imagery. A Bayesian network (BN) approach is proposed to take care of the different structure of the inaccuracies in the two data sources. It addresses the bias in the 3-PG model and the noise of the ASTER images. Moreover, the EM algorithm is introduced into BN to estimate missing the LAI ASTER data, since they are not available for long time series due to the atmospheric conditions. This paper shows that the outputs obtained with the BN were more accurate than the 3-PG estimate, as the root mean square error reduces to 0.46, and the relative error to 5.86 percent. We conclude that the EM-algorithm within a BN can adequately handle missing LAI ASTER values, and BNs can improve the estimation of LAI values. Ultimately, this method may be used as a predicting model of LAI values, and handling the missing data of ASTER images time series.

                Appropriate assessment of the accuracy of burned area products is required to assess greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in a reliable way. This paper provides validation results for three burned area products with different pixel sizes: MCD45 (500 m), GlobCarbon (1 km), and L3JRC (1 km) for the Orinoco River basin, which is widely affected by fires, many of them oriented towards the conversion of Amazonian forest to cattle pasture. Accuracy measurements were based on commission and omission errors computed from 15 confusion matrices, as well as in the Pareto Boundary concept, which evaluates the impact of different pixel sizes in omission and commission errors. An edge metric was used to analyze the impact of shapes of burned patches on global accuracy. It was shown that all products underestimate burned-area and that an increase in pixel size or burned patch elongation, results in larger estimation errors.

                The geometric processing of remotely sensed image data is one of the key issues in data interpretation, added value product generation, and multi-source data integration. Although optical satellite data can be orthorectified without the use of Ground Control Points (GCP) to absolute geometric accuracies of some meters up to several hundred meters depending on the satellite mission, there is still a need to improve the geometric accuracy by using GCP. The manual measurement of GCP is time consuming work, and leads, especially for larger data sets with hundreds of satellite images, to a cost and time ineffective workload. To overcome these shortcomings, an autonomous processing chain to georeference and orthorectify optical satellite data is proposed which uses reference data and digital elevation models to generate GCP and to improve sensor model parameters (namely for rigorous and universal sensor models) for a series of optical Earth observation satellite systems. Using a restrictive blunder removal strategy, the proposed procedure leads to high quality orthorectified products or at least to a geometrically consistent data set in terms of relative accuracy. The geometric processing chain is validated using SPOT-4 HRVIR, SPOT-5 HRG, IRS-P6 LISS III, and ALOS AVNIR-2 optical sensor data, for which a huge amount of satellite data (~3,200 scenes) has been processed. Relative and absolute geometric accuracies of approximately half the pixel size (linear Root Mean Square Error) are achieved.

                Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) has been widely applied to characterize the 3-dimensional (3D) structure of forests as it can generate 3D point data with high spatial resolution and accuracy. Individual tree segmentations, usually derived from the canopy height model, are used to derive individual tree structural attributes such as tree height, crown diameter, canopy-based height, and others. In this study, we develop a new algorithm to segment individual trees from the small footprint discrete return airborne lidar point cloud. We experimentally applied the new algorithm to segment trees in a mixed conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California. The results were evaluated in terms of recall, precision, and F-score, and show that the algorithm detected 86 percent of the trees (“recall”), 94 percent of the segmented trees were correct (“precision”), and the overall F-score is 0.9. Our results indicate that the proposed algorithm has good potential in segmenting individual trees in mixed conifer stands of similar structure using small footprint, discrete return lidar data.
