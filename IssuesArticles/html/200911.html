                The 2001 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) tree and impervious cover maps provide an opportunity to extract basic land-cover information helpful for natural resource assessments. To determine the potential utility and limitations of the 2001 NLCD data, this exploratory study compared 2001 NLCD-derived values of overall percent tree and impervious cover within geopolitical boundaries with aerial photo interpretation-derived values for the same areas. Results of the comparison reveal that NLCD underestimates tree cover and to a lesser extent, underestimates impervious cover. The underestimate appears to be consistent across the conterminous United States with no statistical differences among regions. However, there were statistical differences in the degree of underestimation of tree cover among mapping zones and of impervious cover by population density class.

                The Global Land Survey (GLS) 2005 is a cloud-free, orthorec-tified collection of Landsat imagery acquired during the 2004 to 2007 epoch intended to support global land-cover and ecological monitoring. Due to the numerous complexities in selecting imagery for the GLS2005, NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) sponsored the development of an automated scene selection tool, the Large Area Scene Selection Interface (LASSI), to aid in the selection of imagery for this data set. This innovative approach to scene selection applied a user-defined weighting system to various scene parameters: image cloud cover, image vegetation greenness, choice of sensor, and the ability of the Landsat-7 Scan Line Corrector (SLC)-off pair to completely fill image gaps, among others. The parameters considered in scene selection were weighted according to their relative importance to the data set, along with the algorithm’s sensitivity to that weight. This paper describes the methodology and analysis that established the parameter weighting strategy, as well as the post-screening processes used in selecting the optimal data set for GLS2005.

            Adaptive Registration of Remote Sensing Images using Supervised Learning

                This paper describes a system for co-registration of time series satellite images which uses a learning-based strategy. During a training phase, the system learns to recognize regions in an image suited for registration. It also learns the relationship between image characteristics and registration performance for a set of different registration algorithms. This enables intelligent selection of an appropriate registration algorithm for each region in the image, while regions unsuited for registration can be discarded. The approach is intended for co-registration of sequences of images acquired from identical or similar earth observation sensors. It has been tested for such sequences from different types of sensors, both optical and radar, with varying resolution. For images with moderate differences in content, the registration accuracy is, in general, good with an RMS error of one pixel or less.

            Analysis of Dynamic Thresholds for the Normalized Difference Water Index

                The normalized difference water index (NDWI) has been successfully used to delineate surface water features. However, two major problems have been often encountered: (a) NDWIs calculated from different band combinations [visible, near-infrared, or shortwave-infrared (SWIR)] can generate different results, and (b) NDWI thresholds vary depending on the proportions of subpixel water/non-water components. We need to evaluate all the NDWIs for determining the best performing index and to establish appropriate thresholds for clearly identifying water features. We used the spectral data obtained from a spectral library to simulate the satellite sensors Landsat ETM+, SPOT-5, ASTER, and MODIS, and calculated the simulated NDWI in different forms. We found that the NDWI calculated from (green – SWIR)/(green + SWIR), where SWIR is the shorter wavelength region (1.2 to 1.8 mm), has the most stable threshold. We recommend this NDWI be employed for mapping water, but adjustment of the threshold based on actual situations is necessary.

                The paper deals with change detection using time series SAR images. SAR provides a unique opportunity for detecting land-use changes within short intervals (e.g., monthly) in tropical and sub-tropical regions with cloud cover. Traditional change detection methods mainly rely on per-pixel spectral information but ignore per-object structural information. In this study, a new method is presented that integrates object-oriented analysis with case-based reasoning (CBR) for change detection. Object-oriented analysis is carried out to retrieve a variety of features, such as tone, shape, texture, area, and context. An incremental segmentation technique is proposed for deriving change objects from multi-temporal Radarsat images. Feature selection based on genetic algorithms is carried out to determine the optimal set of features for change detection. A CBR matching algorithm is developed to identify the temporal positions and the kind of changes. It is based on the weighted k-Nearest Neighbor classification using an accumulative similarity measure. The comparison of the four combinations of change detection methods, object-based or pixel-based plus case-based or rule-based, is carried out to validate the performance of this proposed method. The analysis shows that this integrated approach has provided an efficient way of detecting land-use changes at monthly intervals by using multi-temporal SAR images.
