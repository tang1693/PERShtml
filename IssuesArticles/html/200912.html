                The overarching goal of this paper was to determine how irrigated areas change with resolution (or scale) of imagery. Specific objectives investigated were to (a) map irrigated areas using four distinct spatial resolutions (or scales), (b) determine how irrigated areas change with resolutions, and (c) establish the causes of differences in resolution-based irrigated areas. The study was conducted in the very large Krishna River basin (India), which has a high degree of formal contiguous, and informal fragmented irrigated areas. The irrigated areas were mapped using satellite sensor data at four distinct resolutions: (a) NOAA AVHRR Pathfinder 10,000 m, (b) Terra MODIS 500 m, (c) Terra MODIS 250 m, and (d) Landsat ETM+ 30 m. The proportion of irrigated areas relative to Landsat 30 m derived irrigated areas (9.36 million hectares for the Krishna basin) were (a) 95 percent using MODIS 250 m, (b) 93 percent using MODIS 500 m, and (c) 86 percent using AVHRR 10,000 m. In this study, it was found that the precise location of the irrigated areas were better established using finer spatial resolution data. A strong relationship (R2= 0.74 to 0.95) was observed between irrigated areas determined using various resolutions. This study proved the hypotheses that “the finer the spatial resolution of the sensor used, greater was the irrigated area derived,” since at finer spatial resolutions, fragmented areas are detected better. Accuracies and errors were established consistently for three classes (surface water irrigated, ground water/conjunctive use irrigated, and non-irrigated) across the four resolutions mentioned above. The results showed that the Landsat data provided significantly higher overall accuracies (84 percent) when compared to MODIS 500 m (77 percent), MODIS 250 m (79 percent), and AVHRR 10,000 m (63 percent).

                This study was conducted to develop an olive tree registration database using geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing technology. It also provides information on the methodology used for the database development for the candidate country during its accession process to the European Union. Since olive farming has a great importance to the Turkish economy, an olive registration database supported by GIS and compatible with the Integrated Administrative Control System (IACS) is needed for adaptation to the European Commission Common Agricultural Policy. In this study, cadastral maps and satellite images were used to count olive trees using the OLICOUNT software developed by the Joint Research Center of the European Commission in order to develop an olive tree database. According to the analysis of the counting results for the test sites with 2,291 trees, overall omission error was 11.1 percent and commission error was 2.94 percent. These results indicate that the determination of olive trees by OLICOUNT within the area of interest has 90.37 percent accuracy that makes the method reasonably reliable.

            An Object-space Simulation Method for Low-cost Digital Camera Stability Testing

                The widespread availability and low cost of digital cameras has been the impetus for their increased use for photogram-metric applications. The metric suitability of these cameras is critically dependent upon the stability of their interior orientation parameters (IOPs), which can be evaluated by simulation methods. Focused on aerial photogrammetry, this paper presents a new method that assesses the impact of camera stability in terms of the accuracy of object space terrain reconstruction from a large number of simulations. The results of this method are compared with those from two simulation procedures based on single-photo resection for ten sets of IOPs from three different low-cost digital cameras and are found to be in close agreement in terms of the decision about camera stability. Detailed analyses show the method is relatively insensitive to the distribution of ground control points used for camera orientation and the realism of the randomly-generated terrain, but is highly sensitive to the range of simulated terrain heights and image point measurement precision.

                This paper presents a novel approach for automatically finding conjugate points between video images collected by a small autonomous unmanned aircraft. Our approach introduces the idea of saving the resampled patch from successive least-squares matching epochs and using them as templates for subsequent images. Tests show that this method is superior to using the first image as a template for all subsequent matching attempts. We show how the algorithm performs in terms of retention of points on successive images, distribution of points on the images, and utility when used for bundle adjustments in comparison with the conventional method of using the first image as a template. Our proposed method is able to match points on an average of 2.7 times as many images before failure compared with using the conventional method. This leads to stronger geometrical configuration, higher redundancy, and ultimately, significantly better bundle adjustment solutions.

            A Simplified Analytical Model for a-priori Lidar Point-positioning Error Estimation and a Review of Lidar Error Sources

                Although various rigorous lidar error models already exist and examples of a-posteriori studies of lidar data accuracies verified with field-work can be found in the literature, a simple measure to define a-priori error sizes is not available. In this paper, the lidar error contributions are described in detail: the basic systematic error sources, the flight-mission-related error sources, and the target-characteristic-related error sources. A review of the different error-source sizes is drawn from the literature in order to define the boundary conditions for each error size. Schenk’s geolocation equation is used as a basis for deriving a simplified error model. This model enables a quick calculation and gives a-priori plausible values for the average and maximum error size, independent of the scan and heading angles as well as being independent of any specific lidar system’s characteristics. Additionally, some notes are provided for assistance when ordering lidar data, to enable easier a-posteriori quality control.

                In this paper, cadastre agricultural cartography was enriched using crop raster maps obtained from remote sensing images. The work demonstrates the implications of applying two new terms: fidelity and purity. Per-pixel classifications and polygon enrichments were compared taking into account: (a) the consequences of using a more or less conservative strategy at the classification stage, using fidelity, and (b) the consequences of using modal thresholds at the enrichment stage when deciding which category each polygon is to be assigned to, using purity. More than 300,000 pixels and 2,800 polygons were used to measure the thematic accuracy of ten agricultural categories by means of confusion matrices. These were computed at pixel, polygon, and area level. Thematic accuracy was calculated in the classical way and without taking into account unclassified pixels as errors, as well as by paying special attention to the consequences for the classified area. The results show that polygon enrichment is a useful methodology, achieving thematic accuracies of 95.6 percent, when optimum parameters are used, while classifying 87.4 percent of the area.

                Information about tree species-specific forest characteristics is often a compulsory requirement of the forest inventory system. In Finland, the use of a combination of ALS data and orthorectified aerial photographs has been studied previously, but there are some weaknesses in this approach. First, aerial photographs need radiometric correction, and second, the ALS points and aerial photographs are not properly fused due to the radial displacement. In this study, ALS points are linked to unrectified aerial photographs of known orientation parameters, which enables better fusion. Each ALS point is mapped to several aerial photographs, and the average of DN values is utilized; this averaging is considered to be a good substitute for radiometric correction. The new two-stage method is compared to the approach in which only ALS data is used. The results show the benefits of using aerial photographs together with ALS data in order to estimate tree species-specific characteristics. Compared to earlier studies, the new two-stage method shows a considerable improvement in applicability in operational use.
