                A high-precision land-based integrated mapping system has been developed at The Ohio State University to support road centerline mapping operations at the Ohio Department of Transportation District 1 Office. The system represents a transition from the traditional mobile mapping paradigm towards a highly automated and autonomous design following the trends of modern geoinformatics. The two key components of the custom-designed system are a high-precision integrated GPS/INS navigation system and a fully digital and automated imaging subsystem. The van-based mapping system was designed to deliver the road centerline positions at subdecimeter accuracy in a highly automated manner with limited human interaction in near real time. The paper presents the system’s concept and design, followed by an individual performance evaluation of the navigation and imaging components; and finally road test results, representing an operational environment, are also reported.

            DTM Generation from Ikonos In-Track Stereo Images Using a 3D Physical Model

                A digital elevation model (DEM) extracted from Ikonos in-track stereo images using a 3D physical model developed at the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, Natural Resources Canada was evaluated. First, the stereo photogrammetric bundle adjustment was set up with about ten accurate ground control points. The DEM was then generated using an area-based multiscale image matching method and 3D semiautomatic editing tools and then compared to lidar elevation data with a 0.2-m accuracy. Because the DEM is, in fact, a digital terrain surface model where the height of land cover (trees, houses) is included, the accuracy varies depending on land-cover types. Using 3D visual classification of the stereo Ikonos images, different classes (forests, residential, bare soil, lakes) were generated to take into account the height of the surface (natural and human-made) in the accuracy evaluation. An elevation linear error with 68 percent confidence level (LE68) of 1.5 m was obtained for bare surfaces while an LE68 of 6.4 m was achieved over the full area. Five-meter contour lines could thus be derived, compliant with the highest topographic standard. Better results could thus be expected when using stereo-images acquired in the summertime. On the other hand, an LE68 of 2.5 m to 6.6 m was obtained depending on the land-cover type and its surface height. For residential areas, the surface height did not affect the errors very much (2.5-m LE68) when compared to bare surface results because one- and two-story houses were sparse in the test area. Because the images were unfortunately acquired in wintertime and the lidar data in summertime, elevation errors (LE68 and bias) also depended on the type of forest (deciduous, coniferous, mixed, sparse). An evaluation based on terrain slope and azimuth showed that the DEM error was linearly correlated with slope and that elevations on sun-facing slopes were 1-m more accurate than elevations on slopes facing away from the sun.

                Mapping and monitoring saltmarshes in the Netherlands are important activities of the Ministry of Public Works (Rijkswaterstaat). The Survey Department (Meetkundige Dienst) produces vegetation maps using aerial photographs. However, it is a time-consuming and expensive activity. The accuracy of the conventional vegetation map derived using aerial photograph interpretation (API) is estimated to be around 43 percent. In this study, an alternative method is demonstrated that uses an expert system to combine airborne hyperspectral imagery with terrain data derived from radar altimetry. The accuracy of the vegetation map generated by the expert system increased to 66 percent. When hyperspectral imagery alone was used to classify coastal wetlands, an accuracy of 40 percent was achieved—comparable to the accuracy of the API-derived vegetation map. An analysis of the efficiency of the proposed expert system showed that the speed of map production is increased by using the new method. This means that digital image classification using the expert system is an objective and repeatable method superior to the conventional API method.

            Using Remote Sensing to Assess Stand Loss and Defoliation in Maize

                Assessing hail and wind damage to crops is a difficult, labor-intensive task. A quick and accurate method of determining losses could lead to better crop management decisions, more accurate insurance claim adjustment, and reduced expenses for the crop hail insurance industry. Radiometric data were collected in 1997, 1998, and 1999 in Indiana and Nebraska from field plots of maize, Zea mays L.,subjected to varying levels of damage. Incremental differences in plant damage resulted in incremental differences in spectral responses. The red and near-infrared spectral bands provided the most discrimination among levels of damage. Classification of remotely sensed images by damage level was performed by extrapolating spectral information from areas where damage levels were known to adjacent unknown areas of damage. Depending on location, sensor, and date of data collection, it was possible to classify the degree of early-season stand loss at accuracies of 48 to 100 percent. For leaf loss during the late vegetative stages, it was possible to classify the degree of leaf loss at accuracies of 81 to 100 percent and, for leaf loss during the early reproductive stages, it was possible to classify damage at accuracies of 71 to 98 percent. These results indicate that remote sensing could be used to improve the accuracy of estimating crop damage as long as adequate ground reference for different levels of crop damage exists.

                Four distinctly different classifiers were used to analyze multi-spectral data. Which of these classifiers is most suitable for a specific study area is not always clear. This paper provides a comparison of minimum-distance classifier (MDC), maximum-likelihood classifier (MLC), extraction and classification of homogeneous objects (ECHO), and decision-tree classifier based on linear spectral mixture analysis (DTC-LSMA). Each of the classifiers used both Landsat Thematic Mapper data and identical field-based training sample datasets in a western Brazilian Amazon study area. Seven land-cover classes—mature forest, advanced secondary succession, initial secondary succession, pasture lands, agricultural lands, bare lands, and water—were classified. Classification results indicate that the DTC-LSMA and ECHO classifiers were more accurate than were the MDC and MLC. The overall accuracy of the DTC-LSMA approach was 86 percent with a 0.82 kappa coefficient and ECHO had an accuracy of 83 percent with a 0.79 kappa coefficient. The accuracy of the other classifiers ranged from 77 to 80 percent with kappa coefficients from 0.72 to 0.75.

                A system, CoLaPS (Composite Land Processing System), is described for the production and analysis of land-cover information derived from Landsat satellite images. A key aspect of the design is the seamless linkage between its production and user subsystems. This element is based upon a number of postulates. First, for more efficient and diverse usage of remote sensing land-cover products, users require access to a broader range of datasets and functionality, many of which traditionally have resided in the production arena. Availability of these can result in improved (1) visual interpretation, (2) product enhancement by harnessing user expertise and regional ancillary information, and (3) higher level landscape characterizations. A key challenge facing land-cover producers is the need for detailed accuracy characterization of their products. CoLaPS utilizes classification consistency as an accuracy surrogate, leading to measures of classification confidence at the pixel level. This greatly enhances a user’s ability to detect, for example, real thematic change between multitemporal land-cover products.

            A Critical Evaluation of the Normalized Error Matrix in Map Accuracy Assessment

                Normalizing an error matrix is a commonly recommended analysis of map accuracy data. Theoretical and empirical results demonstrate that the traditional practice of normalizing an error matrix to uniform homogeneous marginal proportions produces biased and imprecise accuracy estimates, with the bias most prominent for user’s and producer’s accuracies. When used to compare maps, normalizing to uniform homogeneous marginal proportions evaluates an unrealistic hypothetical scenario in which all classes are assumed present in equal proportions for both the map and reference condition, and the map exactly reproduces the reference area proportions for each class. The marginal proportions of such normalized error matrices do not reflect realistic area distributions of either the map or true condition. For both descriptive and comparative objectives, the advantages typically claimed for normalizing error matrices are far outweighed by the estimation and interpretation difficulties created by this practice.
