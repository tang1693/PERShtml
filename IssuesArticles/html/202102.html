                In a developing city, urban green space (UGS) plays an increasingly significant role in improving the urban environment and beautifying the urban landscape. In the meantime,UGShas been substantially and frequently interfered with by human activities. Taking Shenzhen city (a great metropolis of China) as an example, this study investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics ofUGSand its influence on the urban thermal environment with Landsat images. From 1978 to 2018, all croplands and more than 50% of water bodies disappeared, while the built-up area increased more than 6 times. The rapid expansion of impervious surface and loss ofUGSled to the spread of a surface urban heat island. The study shows thatUGShas a significantly mitigating impact on urban land surface temperature, with cold islands mainly located at city parks. The results will be of great significance for improvingUGSmanagement, alleviating the urban heat island effect, and establishing a sustainable eco-environment.

                Index-based methods are widely applied to urban impervious surface area (ISA) mapping, but the confusion between ISA and soil remains unsolved. In this article, the near-infrared (NIR)-blue bands were selected as feature space by analyzing the spectra from the US Geological Survey spectral library, and a simple impervious surface ratio index (ISRI) was developed by shifting the NIR-blue coordinate origin toward the convergence point of the fitting lines of ISA and soil. The ISRI was then validated for threshold simulation, separability, and correlation analysis. Results demonstrated that ISRI had a good performance for ISA mapping in four cities in China with different geographic environments, with all extraction accuracies all above 90%. ISRI had a high separability between ISA and soil and was better than other indices (normalized difference built-up index and biophysical composition index). Further, ISRI has a close relationship with the ISA proportion. Therefore, ISRI would be a simple and reliable index for urban ISA mapping.

                Reclaimed airports usually have fragile geological structures and are susceptible to the uneven ground settlements caused by filling-material consolidation, underground construction, and dynamic loading from takeoff and landing of aircrafts. Therefore, deformation monitoring is of great significance to the safe operation of reclaimed airports. This study adopts an improved permanent-scatterer interferometric synthetic-aperture radar strategy to map the spatiotemporal deformation of Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport in China using ascending and descending Envisat/ASAR data acquired from 2007 to 2010 and Sentinel-1 data from 2015 to 2019. The results show that uneven settlements of the airport concentrate in the new reclaimed land. Then we explore the settlement characteristics of each functional area. Furthermore, we separate out the dynamic-load settlement of runway No. 2 and confirm the settlements caused by dynamic load. This study provides new ideas for studying deformation in similar fields, and technical references for the future construction of Shenzhen Airport.

                The urgency of creating appropriate, high-resolution data products such as impervious cover information has increased as cities face rapid growth as well as climate change and other environmental challenges. This work explores the use of fully convolutional neural networks (FCNNs )—specifically UNet with a ResNet-152 encoder—in mapping impervious surfaces at the pixel level from WorldView-2 in a mixed urban/residential environment. We investigate three-, four-, and eight-band multispectral inputs to the FCNN. Resulting maps are promising in both qualitative and quantitative assessment when compared to automated land use/land cover products. Accuracy was assessed by F1 and average precision (AP) scores, as well as receiver operating characteristic curves, with area under the curve (AUC ) used as an additional accuracy metric. The four-band model shows the highest average test-set accuracies (F1, AP, and AUC of 0.709, 0.82, and 0.807, respectively), with higher AP and AUC than the automated land use/land cover products, indicating the utility of the blue-green-red-infrared channels for the FCNN. Improved performance was seen in residential areas, with worse performance in more densely developed areas.

                With the development of urbanization in the world, dealing with the problems caused by urban expansion is becoming more and more important. The data that need to be processed in urbanization studies have increased with the improvement of the spatial and temporal resolution of remote sensing satellites, exerting considerable pressure on traditional software used for landscape index computation. In this article, an improved landscape index-computing algorithm is proposed. Based on CUDA, a pixel-group parallelization strategy is adopted to optimize the algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithm increases the efficiency by more than a factor of three as the amount of data to be processed increases to 50 million pixels, thus providing a new way to calculate large-scale landscape index values on personal computers to study urbanization.

                With the improvement of spatial resolution of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR ) images, there was more research on texture features extracted from PolSAR images; however, the performance of texture features derived from different descriptors in PolSAR images was not fully explored. In this study, the performance of combining polarization features with texture features extracted by four descriptors, respectively, in land cover classification was explored. The experimental results indicated that: (1) different texture features have different abilities to distinguish ground objects; (2) with the improvement of spatial resolution of PolSAR images, texture features should not be ignored; (3) polarization features are very important for land cover classification, texture features can be used as auxiliary features to further improve the classification accuracy. This study could serve as a meaningful reference for information extraction from PolSAR images.

                With the development of urbanization in the world, dealing with the problems caused by urban expansion is becoming more and more important. The data that need to be processed in urbanization studies have increased with the improvement of the spatial and temporal resolution of remote sensing satellites, exerting considerable pressure on traditional software used for landscape index computation. In this article, an improved landscape index-computing algorithm is proposed. Based on CUDA, a pixel-group parallelization strategy is adopted to optimize the algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithm increases the efficiency by more than a factor of three as the amount of data to be processed increases to 50 million pixels, thus providing a new way to calculate large-scale landscape index values on personal computers to study urbanization.

                With the improvement of spatial resolution of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR ) images, there was more research on texture features extracted from PolSAR images; however, the performance of texture features derived from different descriptors in PolSAR images was not fully explored. In this study, the performance of combining polarization features with texture features extracted by four descriptors, respectively, in land cover classification was explored. The experimental results indicated that: (1) different texture features have different abilities to distinguish ground objects; (2) with the improvement of spatial resolution of PolSAR images, texture features should not be ignored; (3) polarization features are very important for land cover classification, texture features can be used as auxiliary features to further improve the classification accuracy. This study could serve as a meaningful reference for information extraction from PolSAR images.
