                Recent studies have attempted to extract impervious surfaces from high-resolution satellite imagery such as Ikonos and QuickBird. These images, however, often lack necessary spectral information due to technological limitations. This study integrates spectral information (temperature and moisture) derived from Landsat-7 ETM+ imagery with Ikonos imagery to derive high-resolution impervious surface information. Furthermore, three popular methods, including linear regression modeling, artificial neural network, and regression tree have been developed and compared using a paired t-test statistic. Analysis of results reveal that Tasseled Cap components particularly greenness and wetness of Ikonos imagery are most important in estimating sub-pixel imperviousness. Also, to some extent the brightness temperature derived from Landsat-7 ETM+ image helps in better estimation of impervious surfaces. Moreover, a comparative analysis indicates that the non-linear approaches yielded statistically better results. Particularly, the regression tree model generated best results with highest Pearsonâ€™s r (0.939) and lowest mean absolute error (8.307).

                Giant pandas(Ailuropoda melanoleuca)and golden takin(Budorcas taxicolor bedfordi)are large mammals that occur together throughout the southern part of the Qinling Mountains in China. Both species have the habit of altitudinal migration in a mixed forest-bamboo landscape. Although previous studies have reported that the migration patterns of giant pandas and golden takin seem different, little is known about these differences in relation to their food quality and quantity. We used radio-telemetry data from six giant pandas and three golden takin groups to determine whether differences in their migration patterns are related to satellitederived plant phenology (a surrogate of food quality) and bamboo abundance (a surrogate of food quantity). Our results suggest that the altitudinal migration patterns of both the giant panda and the golden takin follow the phenological development of plants in the study area, and the difference between them seems to be attributable to the difference in the phenology of bamboo and non-bamboo plants, and thus the abundance and quality of food available to these two species.

            A Piecewise Approach to Epipolar Resampling of Pushbroom Satellite Images Based on RPC

                Epipolar line determination and image resampling are important steps for stereo image processing. Unlike frame cameras that have well-known epipolar geometry, the pushbroom camera does not produce straight epipolar lines and the epipolar pair does not exist for the entire scene. These properties make it difficult to establish epipolar geometry of the pushbroom camera for epipolar image resampling. Therefore, some researchers have adopted approximate models to avoid these problems. In this study, a new method for the conjugate epipolar curve pair determination and epipolar resampling of spaceborne pushbroom images based on RPC is proposed. The proposed method assumes that the conjugate epipolar curve pairs exist approximately for the local scene area and the global epipolar pairs can also exist if the local pairs are sequentially linked. Then, epipolar image resampling is established by reassigning the generated conjugate epipolar curve pair points to satisfy the epipolar resampling image condition. Ikonos stereo images are tested for the evaluation, and the proposed method showed a maximum y-parallax of 1.25 pixels for manually measured tie points, while the resampling method by the parallel projection model showed a maximum of 4.59 pixels.

            Total Variation Methods for Three Dimensional Lidar Image Denoising

                New imaging capabilities have given rise to higher dimensional image processing. This paper presents a generalization of total variation (TV) based denoising model with a specific application to three-dimensional flash lidar imagery. The generalization uses a weighted norm, rather than the standard Euclidean measure, that accounts for sampling differences that may exist along different axes. We compare this new method against successive two-dimensional denoising and three-dimensional TV denoising. The results show that denoising with a weighted norm presents much better object recognition for multi-plane objects compared with both of the other methods. Further, it does not blur single plane objects beyond the result obtained with two-dimensional denoising.

                This paper confirms the need for detailed 3D models for the simulation of high-resolution SAR images in order to support Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) focused on single urban objects. Using a building model enhanced by facade grammar, multiple reflections at building facades are analyzed using ray tracing techniques and scatterers are localized in azimuth, range, and elevation. In a case study, salient signatures of a TerraSAR-X image are analyzed based on simulated SAR reflectivity maps. Phase centers of trihedral reflections are mapped onto the building model and the physical correspondence of scatterers to building features is investigated. Surfaces contributing to salient scatterers are identified at the building model. Eventually, the use of SAR simulation to support PSI is shown from two aspects: (a) for providing a-priori information about building layover, and (b) for extending knowledge about the nature of dominant scatterers.

                The potential of reflectance spectroscopy to estimate the concentration of biochemical compounds related to tea (Camellia sinensis (L.)) quality (total tea polyphenols and free amino acids) is demonstrated. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) was performed to establish the relationship between reflectance and biochemicals for leaf powders as well as fresh leaves. Highest accuracy was found for tea powders with a cross-validated r2of 0.97 for tea polyphenols and 0.99 for free amino acids, and the root mean square error of cross validations (RMSECVS) are 8.36 mg gâˆ’1and 1.01 mg gâˆ’1for the two chemicals. The accuracy achieved at leaf level was slightly lower, with results yielding cross-validated r2of 0.91 and 0.93 with RMSECVS of 13.74 mg gâˆ’1and 2.32 mg gâˆ’1for tea polyphenols and free amino acids, respectively. Important wavelengths for prediction of the two biochemicals from powder and leaf spectra were identified using the PLSR bcoefficients as indicators. Wavelengths of 1,131 nm, 1,654 nm, 1,666 nm, 1,738 nm and 1,752 nm were identified as bands related to absorption by total tea polyphenols, while 1,492 nm represented the absorption feature of free amino acids. The results obtained using fresh leaves indicate that hyperspectral remote sensing may be useful for routine monitoring of tea chemistry at landscape scale.
