                Monitoring of soil moisture over earthen levees can help in revealing patterns of moisture variation which could indicate potential slope failures or other vulnerabilities. In this work a machine learning approach using a back propagation neural network (BPNN) and also a wavelet basis neural network (WBNN) is developed to estimate the soil electrical conductivity (EC) over an earthen levee system. Three scenarios based on the extracted features are investigated to estimate the conductivity. In scenario one, only radar backscatter coefficients are considered. In scenario 2, in addition to the backscatter features an average of backscatter in a sliding 3 Ã— 3 window is used. In scenario 3, texture features are added, including statistical and wavelet features. The results show that using all backscatter and texture features (scenario 3) results in better correlation performance, with an 11 to 27 percent improvement compared to scenario 1 and a 1 to 17 percent improvement over scenario 2.

            RPC-Based Coregistration of VHR Imagery for Urban Change Detection

                In urban change detection, coregistration between bi-temporal Very High Resolution (VHR) images taken from different viewing angles, especially from high off-nadir angles, is very challenging. The relief displacements of elevated objects in such images usually lead to significant misregistration that negatively affects the accuracy of change detection. This paper presents a novel solution, called Patch-Wise CoRegistration (PWCR), that can overcome the misregistration problem caused by viewing angle difference and accordingly improve the accuracy of urban change detection. The PWCR method utilizes a Digital Surface Model (DSM) and the Rational Polynomial Coefficients (RPCs) of the images to find corresponding points in a bi-temporal image set. The corresponding points are then used to generate corresponding patches in the image set. To prove that the PWCR method can overcome the misregistration problem and help achieving accurate change detection, two change detection criteria are tested and incorporated into a change detection framework. Experiments on four bi-temporal image sets acquired by Ikonos, GeoEye-1, and Worldview-2 satellites from different viewing angles show that the PWCR method can achieve highly accurate image patch coregistration (up to 80 percent higher than traditional coregistration for elevated objects), so that the change detection framework can produce accurate urban change detection results (over 90 percent).

            Registration-based Mapping of Aboveground Disparities (RMAD) for Building Detection in Off-nadir VHR Stereo Satellite Imagery
        </a>

                Reliable building delineation in very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery can be achieved by precise disparity information extracted from stereo pairs. However, off-nadir VHR images over urban areas contain many occlusions due to building leaning that creates gaps in the extracted disparity maps. The typical approach to fill these gaps is by interpolation. However, it inevitably degrades the quality of the disparity map and reduces the accuracy of building detection. Thus, this research proposes a registration-based technique for mapping the disparity of off-terrain objects to avoid the need for disparity interpolation and normalization. The generated disparity by the proposed technique is then used to support building detection in off-nadir VHR satellite images. Experiments in a high-rise building area confirmed that 75 percent of the detected building roofs overlap precisely the reference data, with almost 100 percent correct detection. These accuracies are substantially higher than those achieved by other published research.

            Measurement of Surface Changes in a Scaled-Down Landslide Model Using High-Speed Stereo Image Sequences

                Construction of scaled-down landslide models is an important means for landslide study. The objective of this study is to develop an innovative non-contact photogrammetric system to meet the challenge for monitoring the fast surface deformation of a laboratory-simulated landslide, which can detect pre-failure events and the final failure, provide sectional and overall surface deformation patterns, and generate speed maps during the rapid slope failure. We proposed an event detector based on altered surface features in the slower SLRC (single-lensreflex camera) image sequence to detect pre-failure events, while a combined analysis tool used the surface velocity fields and deformation areas based on fast HSCS (high-speed stereocamera system) stereo image sequences to reveal fast-changing landslide behavior during the short final failure. The introduced surface change detector uses the percentage of sliding block areas, percentage of changed features, and average speeds. It successfully detected four pre-failure local collapse events and the final slope failure; the extent of surface changes reached its maximum to accumulate energy 1.5 seconds before the failure when the average speed of changed features achieved its peak of 0.8 m/s. The developed system achieved a position accuracy of 3.8 mm and a speed accuracy of 0.11 m/s. The analysis result demonstrated a time period of 66 minutes before the failure which is confirmed by significant signals from both imaging and contact sensors and is important for landslide early warning. A field implementation scheme in western China will be designed and realized in the near future.

            Geometrical Consistency Voting Strategy for Outlier Detection in Image Matching

                False matches in tie-point image matching are common. This paper introduces a straightforward and effective prepossessing method to reject false matches from initial matches. The method is based on the idea of Hough transform using only two geometrical consistency parameters, namely, the scale parameter and the rotation parameter between two images. A weighted voting strategy is employed, and it can further improve the robustness of the algorithm. The method can handle a large rate of outliers and produce more robust matches with low complexity. No assumptions with regard to the relative pose between two images are necessary, and large perspective deformation can be handled as well. Experiments with ground reference data show that the algorithm works effectively even when the ratio of inliers is below 10 percent. In these data, the ratio of inliers can be improved from 5 percent to 40 percent on average.

                Two GEOBIA approaches are compared for their effectiveness in mapping dead trees within island montane forests of Southern California: a spatial contextual approach using an artificial neural network classifier, and a segmentation and multi-pixel classification approach. Both approaches are tested with multitemporal aerial orthoimagery having varying spatial resolutions. Spectral transformation inputs are also tested. An object-based accuracy assessment is conducted. Accuracies range between 30 percent to 90 percent for the dead tree class and are significantly higher for the spatial-contextual approach. Inclusion of spectral transforms increased accuracies by 5 percent for the true object-based approach, up to 13 percent for the spatial contextual approach, and reduced commission error up to 10 percent for both approaches. Masking techniques increased accuracies of the spatial contextual approach by 20 percent. With manual editing, the most accurate maps of individual live and dead trees from the spatial contextual approach are suitable for studying spatio-temporal trends in montane conifer mortality.
