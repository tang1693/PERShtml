                Lidar has been established over the past few years as a mainstream tool for the acquisition of three dimensional point data. Besides the conventional mapping missions, lidar has proven to be very useful for a wide spectrum of applications such as forestry, urban planning, structural deformation analysis, and reverse engineering. In the context of a nationwide dataset, it is safe to assume that multiple laser scanners are under different conditions to collect the data. Current registration and segmentation algorithms assume homogeneity in the local point density and accuracy which is an invalid assumption that cannot be tolerated. As a consequence of the wide range of lidar sensors currently available, it is becoming crucial to develop algorithms for the registration and segmentation of lidar data with significantly varying characteristics (i.e., varying point density and accuracy). In this paper, a methodology for the optimal registration and segmentation of heterogeneous lidar data is presented. An example of integrating airborne and terrestrial laser scans is presented and followed by a discussion of the pros of the integration process.

                This paper describes the generation and dissemination of a national three-dimensional (3D) dataset representing the virtual and landscape model. The 3D model is produced automatically by fusing a two-dimensional (2D) national object-oriented database describing the physical landscape and the national high-resolution height model of the Netherlands. Semantic constraints are introduced to correctly model 3D objects. Three areas from different regions in the Netherlands have been processed in order to develop, improve, and test the automatic generation of a national 3D city and landscape model. Specific attention has been paid to exceptional cases that may occur in a nationwide dataset. Based on the test results, the Kadaster, the national agency in the Netherlands responsible for the production of nation wide geo-information, decided that it is feasible to produce a national 3D city and landscape model that fulfills the specifications that were defined as part of this study. Future research is identified to make the results further ready for practice.

                As airborne laser scanning (ALS) gains wider adoption to support forest operations in Canada, the consistency and quality of derivative products that support long-term monitoring and planning are becoming a key issues for managers. The Canadian Consortium for Lidar Environmental Applications Research (C-CLEAR) has supported almost 200 projects across Canada since 2000, with forest-related studies being a dominant theme. In 2010 and 2011, field operations were mobilized to support 13 ALS projects spanning almost the full longitudinal gradient of Canada’s forests. This paper presents case studies for seven plus an overview of some best practices and data processing workflow tools that have resulted from these consortium activities. Although the projects and research teams are spread across Canada, the coordination and decade of experience provided through C-CLEAR have brought common methodological elements to all. It is clear that operational, analytical and reporting guidelines that adhere to community accepted standards are required if the benefits promised by ALS forestry are to be realized. A national Lidar Institute that builds upon the C-CLEAR model and focuses on developing standards, guidelines, and certified training would address this need.

                Comprehensive canopy structure and fuel data are critical for understanding and modeling wildland fire. The LANDFIRE project produces such data nationwide based on a collection of field observations, Landsat imagery, and other geospatial data. Where field data are not available, alternate strategies are being investigated. In this study, vegetation structure data available from GLAS were used to fill this data gap for the Yukon Flats Ecoregion of interior Alaska. The GLAS-derived structure and fuel layers and the original LANDFIRE layers were subsequently used as inputs into a fire behavior model to determine what effect the revised inputs would have on the model outputs. The outputs showed that inclusion of the GLAS data enabled better landscape-level characterization of vegetation structure and therefore enabled a broader wildland fire modeling capability. The results of this work underscore how GLAS data can be incorporated into LANDFIRE canopy structure and fuel mapping.

                Mapping vegetation height over large areas presents a problem of scale: height varies with the individual tree or stand, but the resolution of available datasets is too low to characterize this variability sufficiently for many applications. We address this problem by fusing 1 km resolution canopy height data derived from satellite-based laser altimetry with higher-resolution land-cover data, resulting in 30 m resolution estimates of canopy height. These are downscaled further to 1 m resolution by simulating individual trees. A web service architecture is used, which allows processing to occur on demand without preprocessing large datasets. We compared the resulting canopy volumes to reference airborne lidar data from 262 randomly located 1 km2areas within nine study sites. Results at 30 m resolution show an RMSE of 33 percent of the mean reference volume and an R2of 0.77; at 1 m the RMSE is 66 percent and the R2is 0.38.

            New Approaches for Estimating the Local Point Density and its Impact on Lidar Data Segmentation

                Lidar systems have been proven as a cost-effective tool for the collection of high density and accurate point cloud over physical surfaces. The collected point cloud does not exhibit homogenous point distribution due to the characteristics of the scanning system and/or the physical properties of the scanned surfaces. In order to effectively process the lidar point clouds, local point density variations should be quantified and taken into account for the definition of processing parameters. In this paper, new approaches are presented for the estimation of local point density indices while considering the 3D relationship among lidar points, the physical properties of the reflecting surfaces, and the noise level in the datasets collected by different laser scanners. The impact of considering the estimated local point density variations on the quality of lidar data segmentation results is then investigated by performing a quality control procedure. Quantitative evaluation of segmentation results highlights the efficacy of utilizing the estimated local point density indices for the derivation of more accurate segmentation.

                Airborne laser scanning technology (lidar) makes it easy to collect large amounts of points that sample the terrain beneath. The ASPRS LAS Specification is the standard file format for storing and distributing this data. However, managing the amount of data becomes challenging for surveys acquiring billions of points.We describe a lossless compression scheme for lidar in binary LAS format. Our compressed LAZ files are only 7 to 25 percent of the original size. Our encoding and decoding speeds are several million points per second on average desktop computers. Compression is streaming and decompression supports random-access. A reference implementation with a LGPL license is available at http://laszip.org.On a national scale, the compression savings of storing LAZ instead of LAS can be measured in Petabytes of data, i.e., data that no longer need to be hosted, backed up, and served for download. Techniques like LASzip are imperative in order to manage lidar elevation for an entire nation.
