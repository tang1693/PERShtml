                While the spatial resolution of remotely sensed data has improved, multispectral imagery is still not sufficient for urban classification. Problems include the difficulty in discriminating between trees and grass, the misclassification of buildings due to diverse roof compositions and shadow effects, and the misclassification of cars on roads. Recently, lidar (light detection and ranging) data have been integrated with remotely sensed data to obtain better classification results. In this study, we first conducted maximum likelihood classification (MLC) experiments, a traditional pixelbased classification method, to identify features suitable for urban classification using lidar data and aerial imagery. The addition of lidar height data improved the overall accuracy by up to 28 and 18 percent, respectively, compared to cases with only red-green-blue (RGB) and multispectral imagery. To further improve classification, we propose a knowledgebased classification system (KBCS) that includes a three-level height, “asphalt road, vegetation, and non-vegetation” (A-V-N) classification rule-based scheme and knowledgebased correction (KBC). The proposed KBCS improved overall accuracy by 12 and 7 percent compared to maximum likelihood and object-based classification, respectively.

                Test field calibration is an attractive approach to calibrating and characterizing the radiometry of airborne imaging instruments. In this study, a method for radiometric test field calibration for digital photogrammetric instruments is developed, and it is used to evaluate the radiometric performance of large-format photogrammetric sensors the ADS40, the DMC, and the UltraCamD. In the study, linearity, dynamic range, sensitivity, and absOlute calibration were evaluated. The results demonstrated the high radiometric quality of the sensors tested. All the sensors were linear in response. The DMC used the 12-bit dynamic range entirely, while the ADS40 and the UltraCamD indicated close to the 13-bit dynamic range. The sensors performed quite differently with respect to sensitivity. With the DMC and the UltraCamD a risk of overexposure appeared, while the color channels of the ADS40 showed low sensitivity. Because the sensors were linear in response, they could be absolutely calibrated using linear models.

                Derivation of absolute surface velocities from interferometric SAR data requires velocity control points, and rock outcrops or in situ GPS measurements are commonly utilized as velocity control points in the calibration of model parameters. However, it is often difficult or costly to acquire sufficient number of such velocity control points for the model calibration. This paper introduces ice flow stripes as alternative control points for the calibration of interferometric SAR data. Acquisition of this type of flow direction control points is relatively easy and inexpensive. We have derived the observation equations for the flow direction control points and formulated the least squares adjustment problem for calibrating the surface displace measurements respectively derived from the conventional interferometric method and speckle tracking method. Our experiments with Radarsat interferometric SAR data in Antarctica demonstrate that the exploitation of ice flow stripes as control points are effective, practical, and economical.

            An Ecological Framework for Evaluating Map Errors Using Fuzzy Sets

                The use of fuzzy sets to assess uncertainty in land-use/cover maps provides a robust conceptual framework for examining unique characteristics of map error. By recognizing the possibility of gradations of error, fuzzy sets can be used to assess errors due to class similarity, or the sensitivity of the map legend to class boundaries. Building on the theoretical work of Gopal and Woodcock (1994), we present a practical methodology for assessing map errors using fuzzy sets. A key component of our methodology focuses on improving the decision-making process map experts assume when conducting a fuzzy set assessment of map errors. Using an ecological context to define varying levels of land-cover class similarity, we demonstrate how a decision framework guides the map experts’ decisions and provides a more meaningful assessment of map errors. Our methodology differs from traditional fuzzy set error assessment methods in that the map expert evaluates misclassifications within the error matrix (off-diagonal cells) rather than individual reference sites. Advantages to a matrixbased approach include a reduction in the time required by map experts to evaluate map errors, and a relatively simple means of conveying map error information to the map user. We conclude that establishing criteria for determining multiple set memberships in a fuzzy set error assessment is an important methodological procedure that is commonly overlooked. Our methodology, designed to explicitly identify land-cover class similarities based on ecological criteria, serves as a practical example of how to address this issue.

                In recent years, linear features have been gradually integrated into photogrammetry-related applications to estimate orientation parameters and facilitate object reconstruction, to name just a few. Yet, the correspondence of the conjugate linear features between different spaces or coordinate systems remains crucial to the goal of photogrammetric automation. When establishing exterior orientation of images on the line feature basis, the identifications and measurements of control line features must be involved. In this study, the authors develop an approach for effectively matching line features between object space and image space. The proposed algorithms start from projecting 3D line features into 2D image space employing collinearity equations with approximate orientation parameters. Then, the candidate lines detected from the images are chosen and matched with the 3D line features by imposing, in a sequential manner, geometric constraints that include angle, distance, reference point, and imaging geometry checks. Furthermore, a two-stage matching strategy, where the outcome of the first matching stage by partial 3D line features provides confined matching candidates for the second matching stage, is found effective in lowering the computational load, especially when faced with a great amount of 3D line features. Preliminary tests demonstrate successful, as well as satisfactory, 3D to 2D line feature correspondences using the proposed approach and strategy.

                Mono-plotting from a single photo is an efficient method to 3D spatial information collection. The core of the monoplotting process is an algorithm to determine the ground coordinates of pixel points in a single image by intersecting the view ray with the DEM-defined surface. A traditional algorithm used in photogrammetry is to iteratively calculate the coordinates based on the inverse collinearity equations. Being an iterative method, this algorithm may induce errors to the derived coordinates. When the iteration precision (the distance between the last two iterated points) becomes less than a predefined precision threshold, the iteration is considered convergent and the ground coordinates are produced. However, the true error of the output coordinates may be still worse than the threshold. This paper theoretically investigates the error budget of the iterative algorithm, models the true error from the iteration precision, and estimates the algorithm- induced error in the ground coordinate output.

                This paper discusses the calibration and assessment of a cellular automata model for urban growth modeling. A number of transition rules are introduced in the cellular automata model to consider the most influential urbanization factors, such as land-cover maps obtained from satellite images and population density from the census. The transition rules are calibrated both spatially and temporally to ensure the modeling accuracy. Spatially, each township (about 6 miles × 6 miles) in the study area is used as a calibration unit such that the spatial variability of the urban growth process can be taken into account. The temporal calibration is performed by using a sequence of remote sensing images from which the land-cover information at different years is extracted. As for the assessment, fitness (for urban level match) and two types of modeling errors (for urban pattern match) are introduced as the evaluation criteria. The study shows that the use of images reduces the need for a large number of input data. Evaluation on the rule variogram reveals that the transition rule values are correlated spatially and vary with the urbanization level. The paper reports the study outcome over the city of Indianapolis, Indiana for the past three decades using Landsat images and the population data.

                Since the launch of Ikonos by Space Imaging, LLC on 24 September 1999, the very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery has been applied to diverse fields. Every application needs a certain geometric accuracy in the corrected image; therefore, the planimetric accuracy control of VHR satellite imagery proves to be fundamental. As a rule of thumb, the Root Mean Square error (RMS) computed at independent check points (ICPs) is the global measure most widely used for accuracy assessment in VHR imagery. This paper presents an assessment, focused on two QuickBird and Ikonos panchromatic single images, of the number of ICPs required to obtain an estimation of one-dimensional accuracy (RMS1d) with a certain confidence level or reliability. Thus, two theoretical approaches have been tested to estimate reliability depending on the number of ICPs, and they have been experimentally validated using the Monte Carlo simulation method. The residual’s samples were generated for both satellite images in the best possible operational conditions: (a) using optimal sensor models, (b) with high accuracy ground points measured by Differential Global Positioning System, (c) with an adequate number of well distributed ground control points (GCPs), and (d) using GCPs and ICPs well-defined on the raw images, i.e., with a reasonably low pointing error. Under these conditions, the two theoretical models tested provided a good fit (r2> 97 percent) for the simulated data offered by Monte Carlo when outliers were withdrawn. There were no notable differences between the results obtained from the Ikonos and QuickBird scenes.

                The database design and diverse application of NLCD 2001 pose significant challenges for accuracy assessment because numerous objectives are of interest, including accuracy of land-cover, percent urban imperviousness, percent tree canopy, land-cover composition, and net change. A multisupport approach is needed because these objectives require spatial units of different sizes for reference data collection and analysis. Determining a sampling design that meets the full suite of desirable objectives for the NLCD 2001 accuracy assessment requires reconciling potentially conflicting design features that arise from targeting the different objectives. Multi-stage cluster sampling provides the general structure to achieve a multi-support assessment, and the flexibility to target different objectives at different stages of the design. We describe the implementation of two-stage cluster sampling for the initial phase of the NLCD 2001 assessment, and identify gaps in existing knowledge where research is needed to allow full implementation of a multi-objective, multi-support assessment.

                This paper proposes non-parametric measures for the fuzzy ARTMAP computational neural network to handle spatial uncertainty in remotely sensed imagery classification, i.e., ART Commitment (ART-C) and ART Typicality (ART-T), expressing in the first case the degree of commitment a classifier has for each class for a specific pixel, and in the second case, how typical that pixel’s reflectances are of the ones upon which the classifier was trained for each class. Results from case studies were compared against the previously developed SOM Commitment (SOM-C) and SOM Typicality (SOM-T) classifiers as well as conventional Bayesian posterior probability and Mahalanobis typicality soft classifiers. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was used to explore the relationship between these different measures. Results indicate that ART-C and SOM-C measures express values similar to Bayesian posterior probabilies, and ART-T and SOM-T are closely related to Mahalanobis typicalities. However, the proposed neural approaches outperform the traditional methods due to their non-parametric advantage.

                A new algorithm based on the fusion of edge and multispectral information is proposed for the pixel-wise classification of very high-resolution (VHR) remotely sensed imagery. It integrates the multispectral, spatial and structural information existing in the image. The edge feature is first extracted using an improved multispectral edge detection method, which takes into account the original multispectral bands, the linear NDVI, and the independent spectral components extracted by independent component analysis (ICA). Direction-lines are then defined using the edge and multispectral information. Two effective spatial measures are calculated based on the direction-lines in order to describe the contextual information and strengthen the multispectral feature space. Then, the support vector machine (SVM) is employed to classify the hybrid structural-multispectral feature set. In experiments, the proposed spatial measures were compared with the pixel shape index (PSI) and the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs well in terms of classification accuracies and visual interpretation.
