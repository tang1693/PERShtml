                This paper proposes a method for tight integration of IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), stereoVO(Visual Odometry) and digital map for land vehicle navigation, which effectively limits the quick drift ofDR(Dead Reckoning) navigation system. In this method, theINSprovides the dynamic information of the land vehicle, which is used to predict the position and attitude of cameras in order to obtain the predicted pixel coordinates of features on the image. The difference between the measured and predicted pixel coordinates is used to reduce the accumulated errors ofINS. To implement the proposed method, an Extended Kalman filter (EKF) is first used to integrate the inertial and visual sensor data. The integrated solution of position, velocity and azimuth is then applied by fuzzy logic map matching (MM) to project the vehicle location on the correct road link. The projected position on the road link and the road link azimuth can finally be used to reduce the dead reckoning drifts. In this way, the accumulated system errors can be significantly reduced. The testing results indicate that the horizontalRMSE(root-mean-square-error) of the proposed method is less than 20 meters over a traveled distance of five kilometers and the relative horizontal error is below 0.4 percent.

                Spherical panoramic image processing has received renewed interest in the fields of photogrammetry and computer vision. The difficulty in spherical matching is largely due to inevitable image distortions introduced from the equirectangular projection. In this paper, we present an effective strategy for tackling the problem of distortion to improve the performance of spherical image matching. The effectiveness of the rectified matching is evaluated with simulated data and compared with state-of-art methods. In addition, experiments with respect to matching between omnidirectional and planar images, establishing 2D-to-3D correspondence with lidar, and the pose estimation of a spherical image sequence are conducted. The results verify the utility of the proposed method, which provides stable and evenly distributed corresponding points, and it is suitable for integration with conventional techniques for further 3D exploitation of imagery.

                In this study, we assessed the feasibility of using optical flow, in particular, large displacement optical flow (LDOF) method as a possible solution to obtain surface movement data to derive ice flow velocities in a glacier. Tests were carried out at the Viedma Glacier, located at the South Patagonia Icefield, Argentina, where terrestrial monoscopic image sequences were acquired by a calibrated camera from April 2014 until April 2016. As for preprocessing, the Correlated Analysis method was implemented to avoid and minimize errors due to the measurable changes in lighting, shadows, clouds, and snow. The results show a flow field with a maximum surface velocity value of 3.5 m/d. The errors were minimized by averaging the image sequence results based on seasons, in which the Total Error Reconstruction yielded fairly good mean accuracy (0.36 m/d). In summary, it was demonstrated thatLDOFcan provide accurate and robust solution to detect daily changes in the glacier surface.

                Soil salinity is one of the common factors leading to land degradation problems on earth, especially in arid and semiarid regions. There is an urgent need for rapid, accurate and cost-effective monitoring and assessment of soil salinization. Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are employed as viable technologies for detecting, monitoring, and predicting spatial-temporal patterns of soil salinization. The purpose of this study is to establish partial least squares regression (PLSR) models that are based on remotely sensed data and field measured electrical conductivity (ECa) and to retrieve soil salinity estimates by constructing an optimal model. First, the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) was calculated based on WorldView-2 images. Second, a statistical regression method was applied to analyze the correlation between ECa andSAVIunder different parameters. TheSAVIthat was measured as the most stable parameter was an optimum index. Finally, aPLSRprediction model of soil salinity was established based on the sensitivity bands, the optimum index and ECa. The results of this study are the following: (a) According to the adjusted parameter (L = 100), theSAVIindex illustrated the best correlation with ECa, and ECa was also significantly related to the bands ((Red Edge) Band6, (Near-IR1) Band7 and (Near-IR2) Band8) derived from a World-view-2 image. (b) The results of thePLSRpredictive model calibration showed that the model-D performed best through the sensitivity bands and optimal index, with the highest coefficient of determination (R2= 0.67) and the smallest root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.19 dSÂ·m-1. The results indicated that the model-D that is constructed and applied in this paper could provide quantitative information for detecting and monitoring soil salinization in the Keriya Oasis and could also supply examples for the study of soil salinization in arid and semiarid regions with similar environmental conditions.
