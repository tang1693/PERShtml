                Mars rover localization is usually realized with data from odometers, inertial measurement units, and stereo cameras. Location errors accumulate inevitably during any long-range rover traverse when data from only these ground-based sensors is employed. This paper presents a new approach to rover localization based on feature extraction and matching between ground (rover) and orbital imagery. This new approach can localize the rover in orbital imagery, eliminating the accumulated localization error and thereby improving the localization accuracy for long range rover traverse. The proposed approach is tested using NAVCAM images acquired by the Spirit and Opportunity rovers at multiple positions along with HIRISE orbital imagery covering the two landing sites. Results show that this new approach is effective in areas where there are outstanding rocks or outcroppings. The accuracy of this new localization approach is better than one pixel of the HIRISE image (which is 0.25 m).

            Seasonal Trends in Separability of Leaf Reflectance Spectra for Ailanthus altissima and Four Other Tree Species

                The separability of Ailanthus altissima (tree of heaven) from four native species was investigated using spectral reflectance measurements (350 to 2,500 nm) of leaves collected from 13 May through 24 August 2008. For both the original reflectance and a continuum removed dataset, least angle regression (LARS) and random forest classification were used to identify a single set of optimal wavelengths across all sampled dates, a set of optimal wavelengths for each date, and the dates for which Ailanthus is most separable from other species. Leaf classification accuracy was found to vary with both dates and bands used. Contrary to expectations that early spring would provide the best separability, July and August were also identified as potentially good months for species differentiation. Applying continuum removal generally reduced classification error. Band selection using LARS improved classification accuracy. The optimal spectral bands were selected from across the spectrum, typically including 401 to 431 nm, 1,115 nm, and 1,985 to 1,995 nm.

                Close-range photogrammetry is a widely used technique to acquire dimensional data of buildings. The indirect measurement of buildings under construction from images avoids the use of tedious and risky direct procedures. In this paper, we present the extension of a 2D low-cost measurement system previously developed to a 3D measurement of buildings under construction. This system consists of a digital, off-the-shelf camera and a laser distance meter which is mounted on an in-house support that permits independent orientation of the distance meter. Combining the image, the distance and the support orientation from different points of view, we can obtain a scaled 3D model that permits us to make an inventory of a building under construction with a relative error below 0.7 percent.

            Extraction of Tree Crowns from High Resolution Imagery over Eucalypt Dominant Tropical Savannas

                High spatial resolution satellite imagery provides data that enable the analysis of detailed landscape information, including tree crowns. The inherent characteristics of Eucalypt crowns are challenging to remotely sensed tree crown extraction. This paper develops and applies an object-based tree crown delineation approach suitable for estimating canopy cover of Eucalypts in tropical savannas. A two level segmentation was undertaken upon QuickBird data. First, a broad segmentation masked out non-Eucalypt dominant communities; and second, a finer segmentation and ruleset identified seed objects within crowns, and then expanded these objects to cover entire crown extents. Of the 1,604 tree crowns manually observed within the scene, 84.3 percent were detected by the automated seed identification process. Seventy-five percent of tree crowns extracted through the region growing process show strong overlap with their corresponding reference crowns. Results indicate the potential of this method for delineating tree crowns from Eucalypt dominant savanna and the use of this information to estimate canopy cover and tree distribution patterns.

            Empirical Comparison of Full-Waveform Lidar Algorithms

                As third-party lidar software manufacturers are increasingly adding support for full-waveform data, a common question is which algorithm(s) to implement. To this end, a new approach is needed to compare and contrast various lidar waveform processing strategies from a practical, operational perspective. Quality and type of information output, processing speed, suitability for particular applications, robustness against poor parameter selection, and more subjective measures related to user experience are of interest. This paper describes a new empirical method of comparing range extraction and discrimination performance of different algorithms, based on a ranging-lab setup with multiple, adjustable screen targets, with precisely-measured separations. We present the results of comparing three different algorithms described in the scientific literature. The results show distinct differences and also indicate that there is no “one-size-fits-all” approach: the choice of a specific algorithm and adjustable parameter settings are highly application-dependent.

            Dating the Filming of “A Trip Down Market Street”

                “A Trip Down Market Street” is an undated film portraying San Francisco before it was largely destroyed in the earthquake and fire of 18 April 1906. Dates for its filming as early as September 1905 have been proposed, and the goal of this work was to determine a more precise date within that range, without reliance on historical records beyond the film itself. The time of day is indicated by the filmed images of clocks. Measurements of a surviving building and of its shadows within the film, along with a solar position calculator, indicate the time of year was early spring. A different shadow feature, independent of the building’s current measurements (other than its orientation), indicates that the film was most likely shot between 24 March and 30 March 1906.
