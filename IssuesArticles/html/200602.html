                This paper explores the possibility of incorporating remote sensing information in modeling house values in the City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S.A. In particular, a Landsat ETM+ image was utilized to derive environmental characteristics, including the fractions of vegetation, impervious surface, and soil, with a linear spectral mixture analysis approach. These environmental characteristics, together with house structural attributes, were integrated to house value models. Two modeling techniques, a global OLSregression and a regression tree approach, were employed to build the relationship between house values and house structural and environmental characteristics. Analysis of results indicates that environmental characteristics generated from remote sensing technologies have strong influences on house values, and the addition of them improves house value modeling performance significantly. Moreover, the regression tree model proves as a better alternative to the OLS regression models in terms of predicting accuracy.In particular, based on the testing dataset, the mean average error (MAE) and relative error (RE) dropped from 0.202 and 0.434 for the OLS model to 0.134 and 0.280 for the regression tree model, while the correlation coefficient between the predicted and observed values increased from 0.903 to0.960. Further, as a nonparametric and local model, the regression tree method alleviates the problems with the OLS techniques and provides a means in delineating urban housing submarkets.

                To map wildland fires for emission estimation in California, this paper presents an integrated approach to wildfire mapping using daily data of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on board a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) satellite. The approach consists of two parts: active fire detection and burnt area mapping. In active fire detection, we combined the strengths of a fixed multi-channel threshold algorithm and an adaptive-threshold contextual algorithm and modified the fire detection algorithm developed by the Canada Center for Remote Sensing (CCRS) for fire detection in boreal forest ecosystems. We added a contextual test, which considers the radiometric difference between a fire pixel and its surrounding pixels, and a sun glint elimination test to the CCRS algorithm. This can effectively remove false alarms caused by highly reflective clouds and surfaces and by warm backgrounds. In burnt area mapping, we adopted and modified the Hotspot and NDVI Differencing Synergy (HANDS) algorithm, which combines the strengths of hotspot detection and multi-temporal NDVI differencing. We modified the HANDS procedure in three ways: normalizing post-fire NDVI to pre-fire NDVI by multiplying an NDVI ratio coefficient, calculating mean and standard deviation of NDVI decrease of land-cover types separately, and adding a new iteration procedure for confirming potential burnt pixels. When the integrated method was applied to the mapping of wildland fires in California during the 1999 fire season, it produced comparable results. Most of the wildfires mapped were found to be correct, especially for those in forested ecosystems. Validation was based both on limited ground truth from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and on interpreted burnt areas from Landsat 7 TM scenes.

            Control Patches for Automatic Single Photo Orientation

                Traditional aerial triangulation has long relied on control points for orientating the photo models into a ground-based coordinate system, reducing the distortion effect when tying photos by imperfect photo measurements, and calibrating camera parameters. Field surveys to provide an adequate number of control points and manual measurements of the control points afterwards in the photos incur considerable cost both in labor and expense. The past decade has seen the development of digital photogrammetry as a result of integrating into the photogrammetric discipline both the advantages of image processing techniques and the rapid computational efficiency of the computer. Such a development has made possible database-supplied control entities, as well as the automation of matching control data between object space and image space. Inspired by this capability, we employ a control patches database where the control points are found on older imagery and matched in the new photo. The successful implementation of the proposal lies in an effective control patches database, robust matching methodology, and a reliable orientation approach. Single photo resection is applied whenever no less than three matched control patches are available. The experiments under this project suggest the potential efficiency of automatic control point measurements from the control patches database and a reliable photo orientation solution.

                We compared manual delineations with those derived from ten automated delineations of 420 watersheds in four physiographic provinces of the Chesapeake Basin. Automated methods included commercial DEM-based routines and different parameterizations of four enhanced methods: stream burning, normalized excavation, surface reconditioning, and normalized reconditioning. Un-enhanced methods resulted in individual watershed boundaries with some gross discrepancies in watershed size relative to manual delineations (error rate of 0.22 > 25 percent difference compared to manual) and significantly different watershed size distributions (Mann-Whitney U p = 0.012). Integrating mapped streams through enhanced methods substantially improved correspondence with manual watersheds (error rates of only 0.08–0.02 > 25 percent difference). Analysis of cropland area among methods showed a significant difference between manual estimates and un-enhanced estimates (p = 0.049) that was corrected using enhanced algorithms. Subsequent analysis of percent cropland revealed that measurements of land cover proportions were not always affected by delineation errors. However, differences were large enough to influence regressions with stream nitrate-N at the 90 percent confidence level within one physiographic province. Enhanced delineations produced statistical relationships between percent cropland and nitrate-N concentrations consistent with manual delineations. The results provide support for enhanced automated watershed delineation within the Chesapeake Basin and suggest that nor-malized excavation can be an effective augmentation of existing stream burning and reconditioning procedures.

                We evaluated the ability of Ikonos imagery from August and October 2000 to classify prairie pothole community types of the Missouri Coteau of North Dakota. Classification tree analyses were conducted to create land-cover maps at three levels of detail. The analyses successfully distinguished broad cover types (potholes including emergent vegetation versus upland vegetation) at 92 percent overall accuracy. Overall accuracy dropped to 80 percent when upland vegetation was segregated into woody and grassy communities and to 71 percent when we attempted to classify at the species or near-species levels. The use of two image dates was of importance in the classifications; the failure to acquire early season imagery, therefore, might have impaired our results.

            Assessing Accuracy of Net Change Derived from Land Cover Maps

                Net change derived from land-cover maps provides important information for environmental monitoring and modeling. To better target the objectives of net change accuracy, we require modifications of the sampling design and analysis protocols typically implemented for assessments focusing on single date or gross change maps. Mean absolute deviation estimated for user-defined reporting domains is suggested to characterize net change accuracy. Stratified sampling is often desirable to improve precision for high priority estimates (e.g., high net change domains), but decisions regarding the number and identity of strata must be made recognizing the precision trade-offs among the multiple estimates of interest in a net change assessment. The accuracy assessment strategy and a protocol for evaluating sampling design options are demonstrated using a population of map and reference net change derived from existing land-cover maps and representing change from 1990 to 2000.

                The correlation between census population density and Ikonos image texture was explored. The spatial unit for the analysis was census blocks with homogenous land-use. Ikonos image texture was described using three methods: the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), semi-variance, and spatial metrics. Linear regression was conducted to explore the correlation between image texture and population density. It was found that although correlation exists, its degree varies depending on the method used to describe image texture. The highest correlation is given by the spatial metrics method. This result suggests that the correlation between texture and population density is not strong enough to predict or forecast residential population. However, image texture does provide a base to refine census-reported population distribution using remote sensing. High-resolution satellite images therefore have the potential to support “smart interpolation” programs to estimate human population distribution in areas where detailed information is not available.
