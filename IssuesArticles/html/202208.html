                Ancillary data are crucial in land use land cover (LULC) mapping process. This study goal is to investigate if adding Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and digital elevation model (DEM) data as ancillary data to the Landsat-8 spectral imagery (acquired on 14 April 2016) in the support vector machine (SVM ) classification process improves LULC mapping accuracy in GuaMusang, Malaysia. ENVI software was used to preprocess a single Landsat-8 image, convert it to reflectance, and calculate NDVI. ASTER-GDEM data were used to generate the DEM. The logical channel method was used to combine NDVI and DEM with Landsat-8 bands and limit the impact of shadows during SVM classification. The SVM accuracy was tested and evaluated on ancillary data and Landsat-8 spectral-based collection. The results revealed that the user's accuracy and producer's accuracy improved by 15.1% and 2.1%, for primary forest and by 17.93% and 28.86% for secondary forest, respectively. The classification reliability of the majority of LULC categories has increased significantly. Compared to SVM spectral-based set, the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the SVM ancillary-based set improved by 8.77% and 0.12, respectively. In conclusion, this article demonstrated that integrating DEM and NDVI data improves Landsat-8 image classification precision.

                High-speed railway offers an opportunity to address the disparity between economic development and transportation capacity. It can improve transportation capacity and reduce transportation costs. With the large-scale running of the high-speed railway, initial activities will impact the surrounding ecological environment. Ecological environment monitoring along the railway is very important. However, the current research focuses mainly on a single ecological index evaluation of ecological problems and mostly on the ecological evaluation along the highway, with less research on ecological monitoring along the high-speed railway. Moreover, the studies have not considered the comprehensive effects of multiple remote sensing indexes. Given the above scientific issues, taking the Beijing–Tianjin Intercity (BTIC ) railway as the study area, we selected the Landsat satellite images from 2008, 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 as the research data. We used the revised remote sensing–based ecological index (R_RSEI) to comprehensively analyze and evaluate the ecological environment quality along the BTIC railway from 2008 to 2020. After extracting the greenness, dryness, humidity, and heat indices, we determined the weights of four indices using principal component analysis. According to the ecological environment assessment index model, we monitored and analyzed the ecological environment along the BTIC railway. The results showed that the ecological environment quality along the BTIC railway generally increased from 2008 to 2011 and then generally decreased from 2014 to 2020. The ecological and environmental qual- ity of the study area generally was ranked as "poor" and "worse." Therefore, the trend of environmental pollution along the BTIC railway was not optimistic and thus led to many problems in the ecological environment. The proposed method is expected to solve the lack or the single problem of ecological evaluation index along the railway line.

            A Matching Optimization Algorithm About Low-Altitude Remote Sensing Images Based on Geometrical Constraint and Convolutional Neural Network

                This article presents a novel matching optimization algorithm for low-altitude remote sensing images based on a geometrical constraint and a convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed method was designed to be effective in enhancing the integrity and accuracy of point clouds generated by stereo matching. To overcome the limitations of stereo matching, we trained a CNN to predict how well image patches match and used it in patch optimization. The main advantage of this approach is that the proposed algorithm can decrease the mismatching and errors caused by noise, deep discontinuity, and weak texture in low-altitude remote sensing images and can reconstruct an integrated and accurate point cloud. Comparative studies and experimental results validate the accuracy of the proposed algorithm when used for dense point generation from low-altitude remote sensing images.

                Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification is the most vibrant research field in the hyperspectral community, aiming to assign each pixel in the image to one certain land cover category based on its spectral or spectral-spatial characteristics. Recently, some spectral-spatial–feature deep learning–based convolutional neural networks have been proposed and demonstrated remarkable classification performance. However, these networks are time consuming when facing a real HSI in practical application. The trained model must be forwarded independently across m × m crops of the image in strides of 1 pixel. In this article, an efficient and practical network was proposed for HSI classification that can take an HSI as an input instance and directly output a dense pixel-level classification map. First, a novel mechanism, training based on pixels and prediction based on images (TPPI ), is proposed and formulated. Second, some basic rules that should be obeyed during network design and implementation are given. Finally, following the basic rules, three TPPI -Nets are derived and demonstrated based on state-of- the-art classification networks. Experimental results on three public data sets show that the proposed TPPI-Net can not only obtain higher classification accuracy than the existing DCNN-based methods but also greatly reduce the computational complexity of HSI classification.
