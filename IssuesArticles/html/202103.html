                The continuous increasing of impervious surface (IS) hinders the sustainable development of cities. Using optical images alone to extract IS is usually limited by weather, which obliges us to develop new data sources. The obvious differences between natural and artificial targets in interferometric synthetic-aperture radar coherence images have attracted the attention of researchers. A few studies have attempted to use coherence images to extract ISâ€”mostly single-temporal coherence images, which are affected by de-coherence factors. And due to speckle, the results are rather fragmented. In this study, we used time-series coherence images and introduced multi-resolution segmentation as a postprocessing step to extract IS. From our experiments, the results from the proposed method were more complete and achieved considerable accuracy, confirming the potential of time-series coherence images for extracting IS.

                For detection of a road network, high-resolution satellite data have been used following the object-oriented classification approach. We used object-based feature extraction algorithms for detection of road networks from a high resolution Cartosat-2F multispectral data in an Indian city with varying terrain conditions ranging from a compact built-up area to a predominantly vegetated area. The approach involves multi-resolution segmentation (MRS ) and spectral difference segmentation (SDS ) followed by road extraction using fuzzy rule-based algorithm based on various object features, viz. gray-level co-occurrence matrix homogeneity, density, rectangular fit, etc. With overall accuracies ranging from 77.46% to 92% SDS approach performed better than MRS which could afford 60.46% to 75.0% only. However, both of these approaches score over the classical Gaussian maximum likelihood classifier which could register only 50.0% to 68.0% overall accuracy. Furthermore, the maximum overall accuracy was obtained in compact built-up site (85% to 92%) followed by sparsely built-up site (75.0% to 88%) and predominantly vegetated site (60.46% to 77.14%).

            Digital Surface Model Refinement Based on Projected Images

                Currently, the practical solution to remove the errors and artifacts in the digital surface models (DSM ) through stereo images is still manual or semiautomatic editing those affected patches. Although some degrees of semiautomation can be gained, the DSM refinement remains a labor consuming and expensive process. This paper proposes a new method to correct errors in DSM or/and refine an existing coarse DSM. The method employs the concept of projected images together with some image matching techniques to correct/ refine the affected regions in DSM. Since projected images are used, the proposed method can greatly simplify the complicated coordinate transformations and pixel resampling; therefore, the errors/artifacts in DSM can be amended more efficiently and accurately. Several experiments demonstrate the practical usefulness of the proposed method under some scenarios, and some potential improvements are also pointed out to accommodate the various needs during refining DSM.

            Remote Sensing for Ecosystem Services and Urban Sustainability

                The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how geospatial technologies, especially remote sensing, can play a leading role in defining urban sustainability based on the evaluation of demand and supply of ecosystem services (ES ). A brief review of sustainable development and urban sustainability will be given followed by demonstrations of the need for green spaces in cities, and the consequences of fragmentation of green spaces on biodiversity. Although there are no substantive figures for desirable levels of green spaces in urban areas for the benefit of inhabitants, the paper proposes minimum desirable areal percentages. The paper defines natural capital and ES and the procedures adopted by researchers in balancing the supply and demand for ES for urban areas. The genuine progress indicator is presented as a measure of assessing human welfare, but it is not pursued as an indicator of sustainability. Examples of the applications of remote sensing technologies for determining supply and demand of ES are reviewed as are the potential of the supply and demand of ES to support decision-making in urban areas, to ensure that development decisions are sustainable and are in the best interests of the urban residents who depend on ES for their life support.

            Monitoring Work Resumption of Wuhan in the COVID-19 Epidemic Using Daily Nighttime Light

                This study analyzes the characteristics of nighttime light (NTL) radiance variation, aiming to demonstrate the possibility of using NTL to monitor work resumption and evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on economic activities in Wuhan, China. The results show that NTL radiance generally decreased during the epidemic. Despite the fact that increased NTL radiance was observed after lifting the lockdown, it was still lower than normal, indicating that socioeconomic activities have been largely resumed but the production scale has not been fully restored, and the decrease in nitrogen dioxide concentration verified this phenomenon. We find that central urban areas and distant suburban areas present different modes of NTL radiance variation. We further observed a decrease in NTL radiance from different urban functional areas, including industrial parks, airports, business districts, loop lines, and residential area, that corresponds to the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on both industrial production and the service sector.

                Urban lidar data are advantageous for capturing the terrain surface of built-up areas, which can be directly used to provide digital surface models. Cloud points are classified into ground points to obtain digital terrain models. This study proposes a method to improve the progressive triangulated irregular network (TIN ) densification method using a TIN connection analysis algorithm, namely, connection analysis via slope analysis. The proposed method comprises five steps: selection of seed points, connection and slope analysis, increasing the seed points, construction of the TIN model of the seed points, and an iterative construction of the final TIN. Seven data sets from the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing Working Group are used to test whether the proposed method can preserve discontinuities of landscapes and reduce omission and total errors by an average of 9% and 5%, respectively; achieving such results can reduce the amount of workload required for result modification during posttreatment, thus decreasing costs.
