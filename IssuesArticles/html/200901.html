                We upgraded an automated forest digital surface model (DSM) extraction method from balloon stereo photographs of a tropical peat swamp forest in Narathiwat, Thailand by evaluating the image matching accuracy and forest surface height (FSH) estimation. We modified an image correlation matching method based on the characteristics of the tree crown shapes. The mismatched area was less than 3 percent of the total area. We estimated an FSH map in a 60 m × 60 m plot by both photo estimation and field measurement, and set the unit area for FSH averaging at 10 m × 10 m. The root mean square of the differences between the mean photo-estimated and mean field-measured FSH was 3.8 m, which was revised to 1.9 m when the forest gaps were extracted offline. These differences were within a reasonably practical range since the range of the mean field-measured FSH was 10.0 to 21.4 m.

                In this study, a new approach is presented that combines forest phenology and Landsat vegetation indices to estimate evergreen understory bamboo coverage in a mixed temperate forest. It was found that vegetation indices, especially the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from leaf-off (winter) images were significantly correlated with percent understory bamboo cover for both deciduous and mixed coniferous/deciduous forests. Winter NDVI was used to map bamboo coverage using a binary decision tree classifier. A high mapping accuracy for understory bamboo presence/absence was achieved with an overall accuracy of 89 percent (k = 0.59). In addition, for the first time, we successfully classified three density classes of bamboo with an overall accuracy of 68 percent (k = 0.48). These results were compared to three traditional multispectral bands-based methods (Mahalanobis distance, maximum likelihood, and artificial neural networks). The highest mapping accuracy was again obtained from winter images. However, the kappa z-test showed that there was no statistical difference in accuracy between the methods. The results suggest that winter is the optimal season for quantifying the coverage of evergreen understory bamboos in a mixed forest area, regardless of the classification methods use.

                Empirical research in DEM accuracy assessment has observed that DEM errors are correlated with terrain morphology, sampling density, and interpolation method. However, theoretical reasons for these correlations have not been accounted for. This paper introduces approximation theory adapted from computational science as a new framework to assess the accuracy of DEMs interpolated from topographic maps. By perceiving DEM generation as a piecewise polynomial simulation of the unknown terrain, the overall accuracy of a DEM is described by the maximum error at any DEM point. Three linear polynomial interpolation methods are examined, namely linear interpolation in 1D, TIN interpolation, and bilinear interpolation in a rectangle. Their propagation error and interpolation error, whose sum is the total error at a DEM point, are derived. Based on the results, the theoretical basis for the correlation between DEM error and terrain morphology and source data density is articulated for the first time.

            A Conceptual Framework for the Simultaneous Extraction of Sub-pixel Spatial Extent and Spectral Characteristics of Crops

                The sub-pixel spectral contribution of background soils and shadows hampers the accurate site-specific monitoring of agricultural crop characteristics from aerial or satellite images. To address this problem, the present study combines measured in situ and hyperspectral data in an alternative unmixing algorithm. The proposed algorithm, referred to as Soil Modeling Mixture Analysis (SMMA), incorporates a soil reflectance model in a traditional unmixing algorithm and as such opens up the opportunity to simultaneously extract the sub-pixel spatial extent of crops as well as its pure spectral information. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using a soil moisture reflectance model, calibrated for an in situ measured Albic Luvisol dataset. Synthetic mixtures, i.e., compiled from in situ measured hyperspectral bare soil and citrus tree canopy spectra, were decomposed and the sub-pixel crop cover fractions (R2>0.94, RMSE<0.03) and pure vegetation signals (average extraction error 350 to 2,500 nm=0.017, RMSE=0.02) were adequately extracted from the mixtures.

                The accuracy of the Canadian Digital Elevation Data (CDED) produced over the past was based on the accuracy of the sources used for their creation (elevation extracted form contour lines or provincial data exchange). No means to characterize the absolute vertical precision was available, particularly in remote areas. A new production of CDED in the North is currently carried out by the Centre for Topographic Information, Natural Resources Canada with the support of the Canadian Space Agency. Approximately 1,500 new data sets are being produced. Altimetric data is partly acquired with the European Remote Sensing satellite (ERS) by interferometry (70 percent) and partly by stereo-compilation with aerial photography (30 percent). The assessment of the absolute altimetric accuracy of the CDEDs themselves as opposed from the sources is required. ICESAT lidar data gives us such an opportunity. The results obtained on the first CDED data sets produced with ERS interferometry are very promising. Accuracy for a group of 21 CDED is in the order of 0.34 m±6.22 m, i.e., 10 m at 90 percent confidence level. Accuracy is recorded in the metadata of each data set and is freely available on the GEOBASE portal(http://www.geobase.ca/).

                Progress in automated photogrammetric DEM generation is presented. Starting from the procedures and the performance parameters of automated photogrammetric DEM generation, the results of some practical tests with large scale images are presented. The DEMs are derived from images taken by a digital large-frame aerial camera and checked by reference data of superior accuracy. In average, a vertical accuracy of σh=13 cm or 0.20 per thousand of the mean flying height above mean terrain has been achieved. Some recent innovations in digital large-frame cameras and in the processing software give hope for even better results. In comparison with results from film-based cameras, it can be stated that both technologies are able to produce very dense and accurate DEMs.
