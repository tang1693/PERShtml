                Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are traditionally acquired from a stereo pair of aerial photographs sequentially captured by an airborne metric camera. Standard DEM extraction techniques can be naturally extended to satellite imagery, but the particular characteristics of satellite imaging can cause difficulties. The spacecraft ephemeris with respect to the ground site during image collects is the most important factor in the elevation extraction process. When the angle of separation between the stereo images is small, the extraction process typically produces measurements with low accuracy, while a large angle of separation can cause an excessive number of erroneous points in the DEM from occlusion of ground areas.The use of three or more images registered to the same ground area can potentially reduce these problems and improve the accuracy of the extracted DEM. The pointing capability of some sensors, such as the Multispectral Thermal Imager (MTI), allows for multiple collects of the same area from different perspectives. This functionality of MTI makes it a good candidate for the implementation of a DEM extraction algorithm using multiple images for improved accuracy. Evaluation of this capability and development of algorithms to geometrically model the MTI sensor and extract DEMs from multi-look MTI imagery are described in this paper. An RMS elevation error of 6.3-meters is achieved using 11 ground test points, while the MTI band has a 5-meter ground sample distance.

                The traditional 3 X 3 cell neighborhood used in a focal operation on a raster layer has a square shape that results in a dimensional neighborhood of which the orientation is eventually arbitrary to the physical features represented. This paper presents an experiment using a circular neighborhood to calculate slope gradient. Comparisons of the results from a circular neighborhood with the results from some traditional methods show that (a) for a smooth surface, the result from a circular neighborhood is more accurate than that from a square neighborhood, (b) a circular neighborhood is generally more sensitive to noise in the input DEM than a square neighborhood, and (c) in a validation using field measurements, the circular neighborhood performs better than the square neighborhood when the ratio of user-specified neighborhood size to cell size is high.

                Using remote sensing to monitor large forest areas usually requires large field datasets. The need for extensive data collection can be reduced through interpretation of several images simultaneously. This study focused evaluating the accuracy and functionality of stand volume models in overlapping multi-temporal images that could form large areas covering a mosaic of scenes. Various atmospheric correction methods were tested to generalize field information outside the coverage of single images. A dataset consisting of three overlapping Landsat ETM+ images taken on different dates was used to compare atmospheric correction methods with uncorrected raw data. The methods tested were 6S, SMAC, and DOS. Aerosol data from MODIS were used in retrieving parameters for the 6S algorithm. The coefficient of determination values for the regression models used in estimating the total volume of the standing crop varied from 0.46 to 0.62 and standard error from 57 to 77 m3/ha, depending on the image calibration method used. All the atmospheric correction methods improved the classification of the multitemporal images. In comparison to the uncorrected data, the relative RMSE values for the multitemporal images decreased by an average of 6 percent on with DOS, 14 percent with SMAC, and 15 percent with 6S.

                A fuzzy error matrix may be used to summarize accuracy assessment information when both the map and reference data are labelled using a soft classification. Accuracy measures analogous to the familiar overall, user’s, and producer’s accuracies of a hard classification can be derived from a fuzzy error matrix. The formulas for estimating the fuzzy error matrix and accompanying accuracy measures depend on the sampling design used to collect the reference data. We derive these estimation formulas for stratified random sampling, a design commonly implemented in practice. A simulation study is conducted to confirm the validity of the stratified sampling estimators.

            Filtering Airborne Laser Scanning Data with Morphological Methods

                Filtering methods based on morphological operations have been developed in some previous studies. The biggest challenge for these methods is how to keep the terrain features unchanged while using large window sizes for the morphological opening. Zhang et al. (2003) tried to achieve this goal, but their method required the assumption that the slope is constant. This paper presents a new method to achieve this goal without such restrictions, and methods for filling missing data and removing outliers are proposed. The experimental test results using the ISPRS Commission III/WG3 dataset show that this method performs well for most sites, except those with missing data due to the lack of overlap between swaths. This method also shows encouraging results for laser data with low pulse density.

                A rigorous sensor model for the georeferencing of imagery from CCD linear array sensors with along-track stereo viewing is presented. The model is based on the classical collinearity equations, which are extended for the specific characteristics of the acquisition of CCD linear scanners. It includes the sensor position and attitude modeling with second-order piecewise polynomials depending on the acquisition time and a self-calibration for the correction of radial and decentering lens distortions, principal point(s) displacement, focal length(s) variation and CCD line(s) rotation in the focal plane. Using well-distributed GCPs and, additionally, Tie Points (TPs), the external orientation and self-calibration parameters, together with the TPs ground coordinates, are estimated in a least-square adjustment. In order to demonstrate the flexibility of the model, stereo images from pushbroom sensors with different characteristics have been oriented with sub-pixel accuracy in the checkpoints. The results are presented and discussed.

                Decision tree analysis is a statistical approach for developing a rule base used for image classification. We developed a unique approach using object-based rather than pixelbased image information as input for a classification tree for mapping arid land vegetation. A QuickBird satellite image was segmented at four different scales, resulting in a hierarchical network of image objects representing the image information in different spatial resolutions. This allowed for differentiation of individual shrubs at a fine scale and delineation of broader vegetation classes at coarser scales. Input variables included spectral, textural and contextual image information, and the variables chosen by the decision tree included many features not available or as easily determined with pixel based image analysis. Spectral information was selected near the top of the classification trees, while contextual and textural variables were more common closer to the terminal nodes of the classification tree. The combination of multi-resolution image segmentation and decision tree analysis facilitated the selection of input variables and helped in determining the appropriate image analysis scale.
