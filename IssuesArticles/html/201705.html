                In airborne laser scanning (ALS), a reference height threshold is employed for computation of height and density metrics, which are used as auxiliary variables for predicting forest attributes. Lacking consensus, practitioners employ different criteria to define a height threshold, which is applied to all the metrics collectively. In this paper, we propose a change of paradigm in ALS metric computation: height thresholds must be optimized for each metric individually, instead of applying a single one for all them. We present an optimization method based on the maximal information coefficient (MIC), which is applied for each metric, one-by-one. Results showed how a bad choice of height thresholds damages the predictive potential of most metrics. While increasing thresholds strengthened height metrics' relationship to volume, it weakened for density metrics, and therefore choosing different thresholds makes sense.

                Effective large-scale landslide mapping is becoming significantly important for analyzing natural hazards and providing landslide locations rapidly for emergency response. Change detection and machine learning methods are commonly used for landslide detection. Change detection mostly relies on several experienced parameters that users have to tune for different images, which limits the practical application. The training machine learning model consumes much time, and it is limited to specific imaging conditions. In this paper, a simple method for landslide detection using a fixed parameter by calculating image saliency is proposed. Landslide is detected as a saliency object within the background of vegetation and bare rocks. It is fast and robust for the experimental images, and outperforms the state-of-the-art, semi-automatic method in terms of accuracy and computing time. Given the high efficiency and robustness of the proposed method, it is applicable to practical cases for hazard estimation.

            Urban Land Use/Land Cover Discrimination Using Image-Based Reflectance Calibration Methods for Hyperspectral Data

                Irrespective of substantial research in land use/land cover (LULC) monitoring of urban area, hyperspectral data is not yet exploited effectively because of lack of local spectral resources and a practical reflectance calibration method. The objective of this research is to develop an effective methodology for urbanLULCclassification using image-based reflectance calibration methods: especially Vegetation-Impervious-Soil classes (VIS), using hyperspectral data. We usedEO-1 Hyperion image of Pune City, India and assessed the suitability of different land covers as reflectance calibration surfaces. Furthermore, we performedLULCclassification using different reflectance calibration methods such as Internal Area Relative Reflectance, Flat Field Relative Reflectance, and 6S for comparative analysis. UrbanVISsignatures extracted from Hyperion image show distinct spectral curves at broader level. Flat Field Relative Reflectance method provides above 90 percent average overall accuracy. An advanced physics-based method such as 6S does not provide any added advantage over image-based calibration methods.

                An accurate inventory of unpaved road network length and condition within a county, state, or region is important for efficient use of resources to manage and maintain this critical transportation asset. Object-based classification techniques provide a cost-effective way to identify unpaved roads within a local agency's road network when the road type (i.e., paved versus unpaved) attribute is missing. We present a Trimble eCognitionÂ® algorithm using four band optical aerial imagery and object-based classification to classify roads as paved or unpaved. The ruleset evaluates relationships between bands and allows separation and segmentation of unpaved roads from other pavement classes. The algorithm is applied to unincorporated areas of a six county region in Southeastern Michigan. Tree shadows on roads and the spectral similarity of road construction materials pose challenges to classification accuracy. An accuracy assessment of the classification indicated that the algorithm works well with overall classification accuracy between 82 and 94 percent.
