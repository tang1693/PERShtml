                The three-dimensional photogrammetric analysis of image sequences is a growing field of application. For the analysis of dynamic processes one important precondition has to be guaranteed: All cameras have to be synchronized, otherwise the results are affected by asynchronism. In this article a new method is presented, which can determine the asyn-chronism of an arbitrary number of image sequences. In contrast to already existing methods, in the new approach the asynchronism is modeled in object space and then converted into an interpolation function containing a set of unknowns for each camera. In this form the asynchronism is introduced into an extended bundle adjustment, in which the unknowns are solved simultaneously with the image orientation parameters and the object coordinates of tie points. Therefore, the approach has no restrictions with regard to the number and the set-up of the cameras in the acquisition network. Furthermore, both the temporal and spatial analysis step are carried out simultaneously.We have implemented the suggested method and have run anumber of experiments in the context of vehicle impact testing. First, sequences with a frame rate of 1,000 Hz observing an object with a speed of up to 7 m/s and an asynchro-nism of 0.8 ms were analyzed. The accuracy of the object point determination could be improved by a factor of 10. Then, five sequences of a vehicle impact test with a speed of 15.6 m/s were investigated. Here, errors in the object coordinates of up to 30 mm could be eliminated using the new approach. Given the small tolerances in car development, this improvement in point accuracy is significant.

            An Emissivity Modulation Method for Spatial Enhancement of Thermal Satellite Images in Urban Heat Island Analysis

                This study examines and validates a technique for spatial enhancement of thermal satellite images for urban heat island analysis, using a nighttime ASTER satellite image. The technique, termed Emissivity Modulation, enhances the spatial resolution while simultaneously correcting the image derived temperatures for emissivity differences of earth surface materials. A classified image derived from a higher resolution visible wavelength sensor is combined with a lower resolution thermal image in the emissivity correction equation in a procedure derived from the Stephan Bolzmann law. This has the effect of simultaneously correcting the image-derived “Brightness Temperature” (Tb) to the true Kinetic Temperature (Ts), while enhancing the spatial resolution of the thermal data. Although the method has been used for studies of the urban heat island, it has not been validated by comparison with “in situ” derived surface or air temperatures, and researchers may be discouraged from its use due to the fact that it creates sharp boundaries in the image. The emissivity modulated image with 10 m pixel size was found to be highly correlated with 18 in situ surface and air temperature measurements and a low Mean Absolute Difference of 1 K was observed between image and in situ surface temperatures. Lower accuracies were obtained for theTsandTbimages at 90 m resolution. The study demonstrates that the emissivity modulation method can increase accuracy in the computation of kinetic temperature, improve the relationship between image values and air temperature, and enable the observation of microscale temperature patterns.

            Modification of Pixel-swapping Algorithm with Initialization from a Sub-pixel/pixel Spatial Attraction Model

                Pixel-swapping algorithm is a simple and efficient technique for sub-pixel mapping (Atkinson, 2001 and 2005). It was initially applied in shoreline and rural land-cover mapping but has been expanded to other land-cover mapping. However, due to its random initializing process, this algorithm must swap a large number of sub-pixels, and therefore it is computation intensive. This computing power consumption intensifies when the scale factor is large. A new, modified pixel-swapping algorithm (MPS) is presented in this paper to reduce the computation time, as well as to improve sub-pixel mapping accuracy. The MPS algorithm replaces the original random initializing process with a process based on a sub-pixel/pixel spatial attraction model. The new algorithm was used to allocate multiple land-covers at the sub-pixel level. The results showed that the MPS algorithm outperformed the original algorithm both in sub-pixel mapping accuracy and computational time. The improvement is especially significant in the case of large scale factors. Furthermore, the MPS is less sensitive to the size of neighboring sub-pixels and can still result in increased accuracy even if the size of neighbors is small. The MPS was also much less time consuming, as it reduced both the iterations and total amount of swapping needed.

            Closest Spectral Fit for Removing Clouds and Cloud Shadows

                Completely cloud-free remotely sensed images are preferred, but they are not always available. Although the average cloud coverage for the entire planet is about 40 percent, the removal of clouds and cloud shadows is rarely studied. To address this problem, a closest spectral fit method is developed to replace cloud and cloud-shadow pixels with their most similar non-clouded pixel values. The objective of this paper is to illustrate the methodology of the closest spectral fit and test its performance for removing clouds and cloud shadows in images. The closest spectral fit procedures are summarized into six steps, in which two main conceptions, location-based one-to-one correspondence and spectral-based closest fit, are defined. The location-based one-to-one correspondence is applied to identify pixels with the same locations in both base image and auxiliary images. The spectral-based closest fit is applied to determine the most similar pixels in an image. Finally, this closest spectral fit approach is applied to remove cloud and cloud-shadow pixels and diagnostically checked using Landsat TM images. Additional examples using Quick-Bird and MODIS images also indicate the efficiency of the closest spectral fit for removing cloud pixels.

                We describe a system that uses decision tree-based tools for seamless acquisition of knowledge for classification of remotely sensed imagery. We concentrate on three important problems in this process: information fusion, model understandability, and handling of missing data. Importance of multi-sensor information fusion and the use of decision tree classifiers for such problems have been well-studied in the literature. However, these studies have been limited to the cases where all data sources have a full coverage for the scene under consideration. Our contribution in this paper is to show how decision tree classifiers can be learned with alternative (surrogate) decision nodes and result in models that are capable of dealing with missing data during both training and classification to handle cases where one or more measurements do not exist for some locations. We present detailed performance evaluation regarding the effectiveness of these classifiers for information fusion and feature selection, and study three different methods for handling missing data in comparative experiments. The results show that surrogate decisions incorporated into decision tree classifiers provide powerful models for fusing information from different data layers while being robust to missing data.

            Spectral Angle Minimization for the Retrieval of Optically Active Seawater Constituents from MODIS Data

                The application of global algorithms to optical satellite imagery often fails to correctly assess the concentrations of seawater constituents (chlorophyll, CHL, suspended sediments, SS, and yellow substance, YS) in spectrally complex marine environments. Additional problems may come from inaccurate radiometric, atmospheric, and geometric corrections of the remotely sensed imagery. This issue is currently analyzed using a data set of seawater samples and MODIS images taken in the Tuscany Sea (Central Italy). The analysis demonstrates that the mentioned problems mainly introduce amplitude variations in the measured reflectance. This may have negative effects on the outcome of inversion algorithms based on the minimization of conventional spectral errors. Such effects can be notably reduced by using an error index derived from the angle between measured and simulated reflectance vectors, which is insensitive to spectral amplitude variations. The potential of a classical and the new error indices is first evaluated by regressing their values against concentration differences of optically active constituents found over the available sample pairs. The performance of the two error indices are then assessed within an inversion algorithms applied to the same samples. The results obtained show the potential of the new error index particularly to improve the estimation of CHL concentration.

                Using multi-temporal European Remote-sensing Satellites (ERS-1/-2) and Canadian Radar Satellite (RADARSAT-1) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data over the Louisiana coastal zone, we characterize seasonal variations of radar backscat-tering according to vegetation type. Our main findings are as follows. First, ERS-1/-2 and RADARSAT-1 require careful radiometric calibration to perform multi-temporal backscattering analysis for wetland mapping. We use SAR backscattering signals from cities for the relative calibration. Second, using seasonally averaged backscattering coefficients from ERS-1/-2 and RADARSAT-1, we can differentiate most forests (bottomland and swamp forests) and marshes (freshwater, intermediate, brackish, and saline marshes) in coastal wetlands. The student t-test results support the usefulness of season-averaged backscatter data for classification. Third, combining SAR backscattering coefficients and an optical-sensor-based normalized difference vegetation index can provide further insight into vegetation type and enhance the separation between forests and marshes. Our study demonstrates that SAR can provide necessary information to characterize coastal wetlands and monitor their changes.
