                We propose an automatic image-to-image registration of high-resolution satellite images using local properties and geometric locations of control points to improve the registration accuracy. First, coefficients of global affine transformation between images are extracted using a scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT)-based method, and features of the sensed image are transformed to the reference coordinate system using these coefficients. Then, a spatial distance and orientation difference between features of the reference and sensed images are additionally used to extract a large number of evenly distributed control points. The specified spatial distance is calculated between features of the sensed image that have been transformed to the reference coordinates and features of the reference image. Finally, the spatial distance integrated with Euclidean distances of invariant vectors is employed for local matching. The average orientation differences between control points of the two images are used for outlier elimination. A mapping function model consisting of an affine transformation and piecewise linear functions is applied to the control points for automatic registration of high-resolution images. The proposed method can extract a larger number of spatially well-distributed control points than SIFT-based methods. The registration accuracy for all sites calculated from manually selected checkpoints has acceptable geometric accuracy at the pixel level.

                The objective of this study was to assess whether surface coal mines in the heavily forested southern Appalachian regions of USA can be separated from the other prevalent forest-replacing disturbances through automated analysis of an interannual chronosequence of Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus images. Forest replacing disturbances were first identified using a vegetation index (VI) threshold, then classified using descriptors of the disturbance/recovery trajectory: disturbance minimum, recovery slope, and recovery maximum. Three VIs (normalized difference vegetation index or NDVI; the tasseled cap greenness/brightness ratio, TC G/B; and the inverse of Landsat band 3, B3I) were used to analyze multitemporal trajectories generated using both pixels and objects. Classification accuracies using objects were better than those obtained using pixels for all VIs. The highest object-based classification accuracy was achieved using TC G/B (89 percent), followed by NDVI (88 percent) and B3I (80 percent). The diagnostic parameters in mined-land trajectories were found to be distinctly different from other landscape disturbances, leading to a satisfactory classification based on disturbance/recovery trajectories.

                A boat-based digital photogrammetric system has been designed, calibrated, and assessed for the purpose of measuring free ranging sperm whales. A first experiment quantified the effect of the geometry between the target and the stereo system on measurement accuracy. A second experiment tested the robustness of the camera mounting system. Conjugate points in the stereo images were measured using two methods: (a) using an automated centroid detection method, and (b) a manual measurement method to replicate real field conditions. The first experiment demonstrated that a relative error of less than 1 percent could be achieved. The second experiment showed that remounting the two cameras on the stereo bar contributed significantly to measurement error. Nevertheless, the error associated with remounting the cameras compares with that associated with the uncertainties of manually selecting conjugate points. Thus, it is demonstrated that dismounting the stereo system for practical reasons while at sea does not compromise the accuracy.

                Currently GeoEye-1 is the World’s highest resolution commercial satellite. This paper analyses the attainable geopositioning accuracy from a single GeoEye-1 Geo image, both through the sensor orientation and orthorectification phases, for panchromatic (PAN) and multispectral (MS) products.Different 3D sensor models as well as the number and distribution of the ground control points (GCPs) used for the sensor orientation were tested. Planimetric Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE2D) close to 0.7 pixels, both for PAN and MS images, were attained using the third order 3D rational functions with the vendor’s rational polynomial coefficients data afterwards being refined by a zero order polynomial adjustment (RPC0). Furthermore, the RPC0 sensor model proved to be significantly independent regarding the number and distribution of the GCPs. The RPC0 model yielded RMSE2Dclose to 0.46 m and 1.56 m for the PAN and MS orthorectified images, respectively, using a very accurate lidar-derived digital elevation model.

            Modeling Riparian Zones Utilizing DEMS and Flood Height Data

                Riparian ecotones are unique, diverse networks of vegetation and soils in close proximity to streams, rivers, and lakes. Previous approaches to riparian boundary delineation utilized fixed width buffers, but using a fixed width riparian buffer only takes the watercourse into consideration; it does not consider the surrounding landscape. By hydrologically defining a riparian ecotone to occur at the 50-year flood height and incorporating digital elevation data, the spatial modeling capabilities of ArcMap®GIS are utilized to map riparian zones accurately. This approach better characterizes the watercourse and its associated floodplain. Riparian zones delineated using 10 versus 30 meter DEMs and stream course information from the National Hydrography Dataset differ significantly. Within our study areas, 30 meter DEMs are not adequate to map elevation changes for accurate riparian area delineation. The result is a robust GIS based model in an ArcMap®Toolbox format to delineate a variable-width riparian boundary.

                This study determined the effect of seasonal spectral variability on land-cover classification of Landsat TM by comparing accuracies in different seasons in a midlatitudinal (29°30′ to 31°0′S) region with summer and winter rainfall, a broad altitudinal range, a temperate to subtropical climate and diverse land uses (e.g., summer and winter crops and nature conservation). The TC, PCA, and NDVI images were used alone and in combination with original bands for classification. Results using PC1–3, Bands 1 through 5, Bands 1 through 4, and 7 combinations were better than others, but the Bands 1 through 4 combination performed best across all dates. The highest accuracy was obtained with a mid summer (January) image (96.5 percent, Kappa 0.96) and the lowest with an early spring (September) image (86.7 percent, Kappa 0.84). The superiority of mid-summer images in generating highly accurate land-cover classifications was demonstrated by analysis of additional images under varying rainfall conditions in different years.

                Riparian ecotones are unique, diverse networks of vegetation and soils in close proximity to streams, rivers, and lakes. Previous approaches to riparian boundary delineation utilized fixed width buffers, but using a fixed width riparian buffer only takes the watercourse into consideration; it does not consider the surrounding landscape. By hydrologically defining a riparian ecotone to occur at the 50-year flood height and incorporating digital elevation data, the spatial modeling capabilities of ArcMap®GIS are utilized to map riparian zones accurately. This approach better characterizes the watercourse and its associated floodplain. Riparian zones delineated using 10 versus 30 meter DEMs and stream course information from the National Hydrography Dataset differ significantly. Within our study areas, 30 meter DEMs are not adequate to map elevation changes for accurate riparian area delineation. The result is a robust GIS based model in an ArcMap®Toolbox format to delineate a variable-width riparian boundary.

                This study determined the effect of seasonal spectral variability on land-cover classification of Landsat TM by comparing accuracies in different seasons in a midlatitudinal (29°30′ to 31°0′S) region with summer and winter rainfall, a broad altitudinal range, a temperate to subtropical climate and diverse land uses (e.g., summer and winter crops and nature conservation). The TC, PCA, and NDVI images were used alone and in combination with original bands for classification. Results using PC1–3, Bands 1 through 5, Bands 1 through 4, and 7 combinations were better than others, but the Bands 1 through 4 combination performed best across all dates. The highest accuracy was obtained with a mid summer (January) image (96.5 percent, Kappa 0.96) and the lowest with an early spring (September) image (86.7 percent, Kappa 0.84). The superiority of mid-summer images in generating highly accurate land-cover classifications was demonstrated by analysis of additional images under varying rainfall conditions in different years.
