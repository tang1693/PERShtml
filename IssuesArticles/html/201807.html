                This study applied an integrated imaging spectroscopy and geochemical approach to evaluate gold mineralization in northern Pakistan. The study analyzed several rock samples for gold concentrations. These analyses found gold concentrations of up to 96 ppm in sulfide-mineralization zones in the Astore area. Several rock samples were scanned using visiblenear and shortwave infrared hyperspectral sensors. Comparison of different datasets provided a method for evaluating spatial distribution of minerals in the samples. Dominant minerals in the alteration zone included galena, chalcopyrite, pyrite, and azurite. The high-resolution imaging spectroscopy data were evaluated using the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. AlthoughSVMyielded fewer unclassified pixels,SAMgave superior classification results and distribution estimates, particularly for sulfide minerals, which exhibit lower overall reflectance profiles. The surface mineral distribution estimates obtained fromSAMare in a very good agreement with electron microscope data.

                Hyperspectral imaging has been successfully utilized to locate clandestine graves. This study applied a Genetic Programming technique called Brain Programming (BP) for automating the design of Hyperspectral Visual Attention Models (H-VAM.), which is proposed as a new method for the detection of buried remains. Four graves were simulated and monitored during six months by taking in situ spectral measurements of the ground. Two experiments were implemented using Kappa and weighted Kappa coefficients as classification accuracy measures for guiding the BP search of the bestH-VAM.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposedBPmethod improves classification accuracy compared to a previous approach. A better detection performance was observed for the image acquired after three months from burial. Moreover, results suggest that the use of spectral bands that respond to vegetation and water content of the plants and provide evidence that the number of buried bodies plays a crucial role on a successful detection.

                In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based oil spill segmentation using aerial images. In detail, a novel deep neural network-based object segmentation, named Deep Believe Active Contours (DBAC), is introduced, where a pre-trained deep belief neural network is utilized to guide the moments of active contours. Results show that (1) Unsupervised pre-trained deep neural network can efficiently control the evolution of active contour segmentation of oil spill regions; and (2) When applying the proposedDBACalgorithm on the test data from an oil spill image database, it produced a recall rate of 66% and a precision rate of 60%, which outperformed the state-of-the-art methods in the range of 4% ∼ 18% and 1% ∼ 10%, respectively. Moreover,DBACproduced a better Hausdorff distance (an amount of 13.34) compared to the competing methods. These results show the promises ofDBACfor the task of oil spill segmentation in ocean environment.

                Early drought stress detection is a promising strategy that enables us to move from a reactive to a more proactive approach to manage drought risks and impacts. In this work, we apply for the first time the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) networks toRGBimages for accurate drought plant stress detection in the early stage. In addition, an optimal data collection strategy (ODCS) is investigated to use less time and manpower for the purpose of accurate early drought stress condition detection. The proposed method is validated on two independently collectedRGBimage datasets. In both datasets, theBLSTMmethod achieves competitive classification performances compared to three other deep learning methods. By using the proposedODCS, our method can use only ²/³ of the entire dataset to achieve 74.6 percent F-score for the patch sequence classification and 72.0 percent F-score for the image sequence classification.
