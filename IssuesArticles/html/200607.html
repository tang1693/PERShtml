                This paper explores the accuracy of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), with particular reference to Australian published DEMs. Direct comparisons were made between cartometric and automatically measured photogrammetric DEMs at various grid spacings with an accurate and dense set of ground truth data. The cartometric DEMs were found to be more accurate than the photogrammetric DEMs for the small study site in this paper, with RMS errors in elevation of approximately 3.5 m and 4.5 m, respectively, and maximum absolute errors in elevation of approximately 12 m and 28 m, respectively. An important factor for environmental prediction studies is slope, and RMS errors in slope were approximately 6 percent and 20 percent for the cartometric and photogrammetric DEMs, respectively, with maximum absolute errors in slope of approximately 75 percent and 290 percent, respectively. However, use of suitable post-processing such as filtering may reduce the errors in photogrammetric DEMs to at least the same magnitude as car-tometric DEMs. The cartometric DEMs were found to satisfy the USGS specifications for Level 2 data.

                Ecoregional stratification has been proposed for sampling and mapping land-cover composition and pattern over time. Using a wall-to-wall land-cover map of the United States, we evaluated geographic scales of variance for nine landscape-level and eight forest pattern indices, and compared stratification by ecoregions, administrative units, and watersheds. Ecoregions accounted for 65 percent to 75 percent of the total variance of percent agriculture and percent forest because dominant land-cover is included in ecoregional definitions. In contrast, ecoregions explained only 13 percent to 34 percent of the variance of the other seven landscape-level pattern indices. After accounting for differences in amount of forest, ecoregions explained less than 5 percent of the variance of the eight forest pattern indices. None of the stratifications tested would be effective mapping units for land-cover pattern because within-unit variance of land-cover pattern is typically two to four times larger than between-unit variance.

                Eelgrass (Zostera marina) can provide vital ecological functions in stabilizing sediments, influencing current dynamics, and contributing significant amounts of biomass to numerous food webs in coastal ecosystems. Mapping eelgrass beds is important for coastal water and nearshore estuarine monitoring, management, and planning. This study demonstrated the possible use of high spatial (approximately 5 m) and temporal (maximum low tide) resolution airborne multispectral scanner on mapping eelgrass beds in Northern Puget Sound, Washington. A combination of supervised and unsupervised classification approaches were performed on the multispectral scanner imagery. A normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from the red and near-infrared bands and ancillary spatial information, were used to extract and mask eelgrass beds and other submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in the study area. We evaluated the resulting thematic map (geocoded, classified image) against a conventional aerial photograph interpretation using 260 point locations randomly stratified over five defined classes from the thematic map. We achieved an overall accuracy of 92 percent with 0.92 Kappa Coefficient in the study area. This study demonstrates that the airborne multispectral scanner can be useful for mapping eelgrass beds in a local or regional scale, especially in regions for which optical remote sensing from space is constrained by climatic and tidal conditions.

            Object-based Detailed Vegetation Classification with Airborne High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery

                In this paper, we evaluate the capability of the high spatial resolution airborne Digital Airborne Imaging System (DAIS) imagery for detailed vegetation classification at the alliance level with the aid of ancillary topographic data. Image objects as minimum classification units were generated through the Fractal Net Evolution Approach (FNEA) segmentation using eCognition software. For each object, 52 features were calculated including spectral features, textures, topographic features, and geometric features. After statistically ranking the importance of these features with the classification and regression tree algorithm (CART), the most effective features for classification were used to classify the vegetation. Due to the uneven sample size for each class, we chose a non-parametric (nearest neighbor) classifier. We built a hierarchical classification scheme and selected features for each of the broadest categories to carry out the detailed classification, which significantly improved the accuracy. Pixel-based maximum likelihood classification (MLC) with comparable features was used as a benchmark in evaluating our approach. The object-based classification approach overcame the problem of salt-and-pepper effects found in classification results from traditional pixel-based approaches. The method takes advantage of the rich amount of local spatial information present in the irregularly shaped objects in an image. This classification approach was successfully tested at Point Reyes National Seashore in Northern California to create a comprehensive vegetation inventory. Computer-assisted classification of high spatial resolution remotely sensed imagery has good potential to substitute or augment the present ground-based inventory of National Park lands.

                In this study, a variogram-based texture analysis was tested for classifying detailed urban land-use classes, such as mobile home, single-family house, multi-family house, industrial, and commercial from a digital color infrared aerial photograph. Spectral classification was first carried out to separate the building class from non-building classes. Then, a building-presence binary image was generated so that building pixels were assigned a value of “1” and non-building pixels were assigned a value of “0.” Multiple texture bands were further generated employing a vari-ogram-based texture analysis and used for land-use classification. The generation of the building presence binary image allowed us not only to fully explore the capability of variogram-based analysis on spatial pattern detection, but also to prevent the variogram-based analysis from being disturbed by the natural fluctuation of spectral signals. The result from using a mosaic test image was considered satisfactory with a kappa coefficient of 0.72.

            An Agreement Coefficient for Image Comparison

                Combination of datasets acquired from different sensor systems is necessary to construct a long time-series dataset for remotely sensed land-surface variables. Assessment of the agreement of the data derived from various sources is an important issue in understanding the data continuity through the time-series. Some traditional measures, including correlation coefficient, coefficient of determination, mean absolute error, and root mean square error, are not always optimal for evaluating the data agreement. For this reason, we developed a new agreement coefficient for comparing two different images. The agreement coefficient has the following properties: non-dimensional, bounded, symmetric, and distinguishable between systematic and unsystematic differences. The paper provides examples of agreement analyses for hypothetical data and actual remotely sensed data. The results demonstrate that the agreement coefficient does include the above properties, and therefore is a useful tool for image comparison.

                For monitoring environmental changes, new digital remote sensors have become available that allow monitoring and change detection analyses at resolutions and scales that were deemed impossible just a few years ago. The advent of airborne stereo scanners of ultra high spatial resolution offers the possibility of a complete digital remote sensing processing system. Current sensors include the High-resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC), the ADS-40, and the Digital Mapping Camera (DMC). For automated analysis, however, the new sensors require also new processing techniques. This paper presents results of change monitoring analyses for areas along the shorelines of the Elbe and Weser rivers in North Germany using integrated HRSC and GIS datasets. An automated procedure for highly accurate mapping was developed which is based on a hierarchical stepwise approach integrating GIS methods and digital surface information in this process. This approach allows the production of GIS maps that are more detailed and accurate than those that were previously produced by conventional means. Within the GIS environment, the multitemporal analysis also allows the exact quantification and location of changes of the protected biotope types.
