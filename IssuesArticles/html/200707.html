                Forest clearing in the vicinity of the Appalachian Trail National Park undermines the Trail’s value as a wilderness retreat for millions of annual hikers. We estimate that 75,000 hectares of forest were lost to clearing during the decade of the 1990s inside a 16 km-wide corridor centered on the Trail. This loss represents 2.45 percent of forests within 8 km of the 3,500 km-long trail. Managed forest harvests in northern New England accounted for 76.8 percent of forest clearing. The factor most closely related to forest clearing is land ownership: only 0.29 percent of protected forests were cleared, while unprotected and managed forests were cleared at rates of 2.05 percent and 4.03 percent, respectively. A combination of boosted decision tree classifiers, multitemporal Kauth-Thomas transforms and the GeoCover Landsat dataset enabled a single, un-funded analyst to rapidly map land-cover change at 28.5-meter resolution within a 3.8 million hectare study area that spanned 16 Landsat scenes.

                Lidar data have become a major source of digital terrain information for use in many applications including hydraulic modeling and flood plane mapping. Based on established relationships between sampling intensity and error, nominal post-spacing likely contributes significantly to the error budget. Post-spacing is also a major cost factor during lidar data collection. This research presents methods for establishing a relationship between nominal post-spacing and its effects on hydraulic modeling for flood zone delineation. Lidar data collected at a low post-spacing (approximately 1 to 2 m) over a piedmont study area in North Carolina was systematically decimated to simulate datasets with sequentially higher post-spacing values. Using extensive first-order ground survey information, the accuracy of each DEM derived from these lidar datasets was assessed and reported. Hydraulic analyses were performed utilizing standard engineering practices and modeling software (HEC-RAS). All input variables were held constant in each model run except for the topographic information from the decimated lidar datasets. The results were compared to a hydraulic analysis performed on the un-decimated reference dataset. The sensitivity of the primary model outputs to the variation in nominal post-spacing is reported. The results indicate that base flood elevation does not statistically change over the post-spacing values tested. Conversely, flood zone boundary mapping was found to be sensitive to variations in post-spacing.

            Building Boundary Tracing and Regularization from Airborne Lidar Point Clouds

                Building boundary is necessary for the real estate industry, flood management, and homeland security applications. The extraction of building boundary is also a crucial and difficult step towards generating city models. This study presents an approach to the tracing and regularization of building boundary from raw lidar point clouds. The process consists of a sequence of four steps: separate building and non-building lidar points; segment lidar points that belong to the same building; trace building boundary points; and regularize the boundary. For separation, a slope based 1D bi-directional filter is used. The segmentation step is a region-growing approach. By modifying a convex hull formation algorithm, the building boundary points are traced and connected to form an approximate boundary. In the final step, all boundary points are included in a hierarchical least squares solution with perpendicularity constraints to determine a regularized rectilinear boundary. Our tests conclude that the uncertainty of regularized building boundary tends to be linearly proportional to the lidar point spacing. It is shown that the regularization precision is at 18 percent to 21 percent of the lidar point spacing, and the maximum offset of the determined building boundary from the original lidar points is about the same as the lidar point spacing. Limitation of lidar data resolution and errors in previous filtering processes may cause artefacts in the final regularized building boundary. This paper presents the mathematical and algorithmic formulations along with stepwise illustrations. Results from Baltimore city, Toronto city, and Purdue University campus are evaluated.

                This study evaluated segment-based classification paired with non-parametric methods(CART®andkNN)and interannual, multi-temporal data in the classification of an 11-year chronosequence of Landsat TM/ETM imagery in the Brazilian Amazon. ThekNN and CART®classification methods, with the integration of multi-temporal data, performed equally well in the separation of cleared, re-vegetated, and primary forest classes with overall accuracies ranging from 77 percent to 91 percent, with pixel-based CART®classifications resulting in significantly lower variance than all other methods (3.2 percent versus an average of 13.2 percent). Segmentation did not improve classification success over pixel-based methods with the used datasets. Through appropriate band selection methods, multi-temporal bands were chosen in 38 of 44 total classifications, strongly suggesting the utility of inter-annual, multi-temporal data for the given classes and region. The land-cover maps from this study allow for an accurate annualized analysis of land-cover and landscape change in the region.

            Estimating Species Abundance in a Northern Temperate Forest Using Spectral Mixture Analysis

                Effective, reliable methods for characterizing the spatial distribution of tree species through remote sensing would represent an important step toward better understanding changes in biodiversity, habitat quality, climate, and nutrient cycling. Towards this end, we explore the feasibility of using spectral mixture analysis to discriminate the distribution and abundance of two important forest species at the Bartlett Experimental Forest, New Hampshire. Using hyper-spectral image data and simulated broadband sensor data, we used spectral unmixing to quantify the abundance of sugar maple and American beech, as opposed to the more conventional approach of detecting presence or absence of discrete species classes. Stronger linear relationships were demonstrated between predicted and measured abundance for hyperspectral than broadband sensor data: R2= 0.49 (RMSE = 0.09) versus R2= 0.16 (RMSE = 0.19) for sugar maple; R2= 0.36 (RMSE = 0.18) versus R2= 0.24 (RMSE = 0.33) for beech. These results suggest that spectrally unmixing hyperspectral data to estimate species abundances holds promise for a variety of ecological studies.

            Exploring the Geostatistical Method for Estimating the Signal-to-Noise Ratio of Images

                The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) has been estimated for remotely sensed imagery using several image-based methods such as the homogeneous area (HA) and geostatistical (GS) methods. For certain procedures such as regression, an alternative SNR (SNRvar), the ratio of the variance in the signal to the variance in the noise, is potentially more informative and useful. In this paper, the GS method was modified to estimate the SNRvar, referred to as the SNRvar(GS). Specifically, the sill variance c of the fitted variogram model was used to estimate the variance of the signal component and the nugget variance c0of the fitted model was used to estimate the variance of the noise. The assumptions required in this estimation are presented. The SNRvar(GS) was estimated using the modified GS method for six different land-covers and a range of wavelengths to explore its properties. The SNR*var(GS)was found to vary as a function of both wavelength and land-cover. The SNR*var(GS)represents a useful statistic that should be estimated and presented for different land-cover types and even per-pixel using a local moving window kernel.
