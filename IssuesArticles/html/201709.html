                There are two major problems in Rational Function Model (RFM) solution: (a) Data source error, including gross error, random error, and systematic error; and (b) Model error, including over-parameterization and over-correction issues caused by unnecessaryRFMparameters and exaggeration of random error in constant term of error-in-variables (EIV) model, respectively. In order to solve two major problems simultaneously, we propose a new approach named stepwise-then-orthogonal regression (STOR) with quality control. First,RFMparameters are selected by stepwise regression with gross error detection. Second, the revised orthogonal distance regression is utilized to adjust random error and address the overcorrection problem. Third, systematic error is compensated by Fourier series. The performance of conventional strategies and the proposedSTORare evaluated by control and check grids generated fromSPOT5high-resolution imagery. Compared with the least squares regression, partial least squares regression, ridge regression, and stepwise regression, the proposedSTORshows a significant improvement in accuracy.

                The grey value g (x, y) of pixel on radiometric spectrum is regarded as a function of the geometric coordinates (x, y). Hence, there is a unity of opposite relationships between the geometric and radiometric information, such that, these two types of information cannot be separated. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel geometric and radiometric simultaneous correction model (GRSCM) framework inspired and developed from least squares matching (LSM). Based on the Gauss-Markov model, geometric and radiometric correction coefficients are integrated and solved by an iterative method with variable weights in the proposed model. Moreover, many state-of-theart models and methods can be integrated into the proposed generalGRSCMframework. In theGRSCMof this paper, RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC), stepwise regression and significance testing are integrated and used. The experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy of theGRSCMis significantly improved compared with that of geometric correction and radiometric correction separately.

                We developed a fast and effective bundle adjustment method for large-scale datasets. The preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithm andGPUparallel computing technology are simultaneously applied to deal with large-scale data and to accelerate the bundle adjustment process. The whole bundle adjustment process is modified to enable parallel computing. The critical optimization on parallel task assignment andGPUmemory usage are specified. The proposed method was tested using 10 datasets. The traditional Levenberg Marquardt (LM) method, advancedPCGmethod, Wu's method and the proposedGPUparallel computing method are all compared and analyzed. Preliminary results have shown that the proposed method can process a large-scale dataset with about 13,000 images in less than three minutes on a common computer withGPUdevice. The efficiency of the proposed method is about the same with Wu's method while the accuracy is better.

                Danjiangkou Reservoir (DJKR) is one of the largest artificial freshwater lakes in Asia and a water source of the South: the North Water Transfer Project. However, few studies have analyzed the spatio-temporal water quality distribution or investigated the causative factors of the long-term water quality variation ofDJKR. In this study, we used multi-temporal Landsat images combined with the multiple linear stepwise regression (MLSR) method to retrieve long-term distributions of the main water quality parameters inDJKR, i.e., total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), permanganate index (CODMn), and five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5). Results indicated the heavily polluted regions and an alarming water quality deterioration trend between May 2006 and May 2014. A combination of land use/land cover (LULC) maps and socioeconomic data was considered to investigate the causative factors of the water quality distribution, as well as the deterioration. This study could provide a valuable reference for the decision-making for water quality conservation inDJKR.
