                Direct georeferencing, also referred to as direct platform orientation (DPO), is defined as direct measurement of the imaging sensor external orientation parameters (EOP), using positioning and orientation sensors, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) and Inertial Navigation System (INS) or Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Imaging sensors, most frequently supported by the DPO technique, are digital cameras, lidar systems, multi-spectral or hyper-spectral scanners, or interferometric synthetic aperture radar (INSAR). While for scanning sensors the use of DPO is compulsory, frame digital cameras can also directly benefit from this modern technique of sensor orientation. With direct sensor orientation, the requirement for ground control, tie-point matching and aerotriangulation (AT) is significantly reduced, or even entirely eliminated, resulting in shorter times of data acquisition and processing, and streamlined and highly automated data workflow and quality control. Most of the time, the requirement for ground control points is limited to periodic system calibrations and quality control check. Direct georeferencing is considered a fundamental technology of conventional mobile mapping systems (MMS).Despite significant progress in GSP/INS-based direct georeferencing technology in the last decade, there is still room for improvement in terms of better accuracy and better tolerance to GPS outages. This paper is focused on three error modeling and compensation techniques that could potentially improve GPS/INS system’s performance on both land-based and airborne platforms: (1) extended gravity compensation, (2) IMU signal de-noising, and (3) stochastic modeling of IMU errors.

                The focus of this paper is to present the current technological development in the field of system integration for data acquisition and georeferencing for aerial survey applications. The presentation is solely based on a commercial fully integrated system, the Digital Sensor System (DSS). The DSS is a fully-integrated, fully digital ruggedized system for airborne image acquisition, georeferencing, and map production. The DSS consists of a 4K × 4K digital camera, a GPSaided INS direct georeferencing system, and a flight management system. The DSS software suite interfaces seamlessly with commercial off-the-shelf photogrammetric software allowing for fast topographic and orthophoto map production. The DSS currently uses a CCD chip with a 9 µm pixel size which allows digital image acquisition with a ground sample distance that ranges from 0.05 m to 1.0 m using its 35 mm and 55 mm lenses. The embedded POS AV direct georeferencing system provides the exterior orientation parameters in both real-time and post-mission modes. The DSS is used primarily to generate high-resolution color and color infrared digital orthophotos, orthomosaics, and topographic maps which can be used for many different mapping, GIS, and remote sensing applications.

                In theory, using a GPS system in conjunction with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) enables photogrammetric mapping even without using ground control points. But such systems are expensive, not highly accessible, and not suited for close range photogrammetric measurements based on airborne video photography. This paper presents an alternative modified system which enables setting the position and attitude of video images acquired from a helicopter. It is a fairly simple system comprised of an analogical video camera and two kinematic GPS rover receivers. One GPS antenna is located close to the camera and used to locate the camera at the time of the image acquisition. The second antenna is suspended underneath the helicopter. It functions as a flown control point and appears in all the video images. Thus, a photogrammetric model or strip is created in which the coordinates of the exposure point and of one of its image points are always known in all the photographs. The solution process for such a photogrammetric model or strip is presented, as well as, the results and accuracy of the experiments that were carried out to test the system.

                Stop signs and speed limit signs (SLS) are the most popular and significant traffic signs on roadways. Unlike extracting stop signs with a distinct red color, extracting SLS in a realtime environment is much more challenging. This paper presents an algorithm for recognizing SLS from video imaging and extracting the numerical numbers of SLS to support real-time road inventory data collection operations. The algorithm consists of color segmentation based on locally adaptive thresholding extraction of regions of interest (ROI) using a depth-first-search algorithm, followed by speed limit sign detection and speed limit number extraction by means of optical character recognition and 2D correlation. The algorithm was implemented in Visual C++ language and tested on a non-Hyper-Threading Pentium IV PC with 3.06GHZ CPU using the images taken in the field with different image sizes. The average processing time for an image of 1200 X 800 pixels is about 125 ms. Experimental results from 1,401 video images show 0 percent false positives out of 1,278 images containing no SLS, and 3 percent false negatives out of 123 images containing SLS.

            Updating A Digital Geographic Database Using Vehicle-borne Laser Scanners and Line Cameras

                The Vehicle-borne Laser Measurement System (VLMS) is a mobile mapping system where three single-row laser range scanners, six line CCD cameras, and a GPS/INS-based navigation unit are mounted on a van to measure object geometry and texture along a street. This paper contributes to a method of fusing the data output of VLMS with existing geographic data sources where the focus is on the rectification of the vehicle’s motion data derived from GPS/INS, which may be quite erroneous in an urban area. An algorithm is developed to correct the four variables of the vehicle’s motion data, i.e., x, y, and z coordinates of the vehicle position and yaw angle of orientation by registering the laser points of the VLMS with an existing data source, e.g., a DSM. The algorithm was examined using the VLMS data that were taken in the Ginza District, Tokyo. By manually assigning 18 sets of tiepoints, the vehicle’s motion data were corrected automatically and efficiently, such that the laser points of VLMS were matched to a DSM. In data fusion, a set of objects, which contained commercial signboards, traffic signs and signals, road boundaries, and road lights were extracted from the corrected VLMS data using an interface described in a previous paper. They were integrated with a 1:2500 3D map that consists of only building frames. In addition, line images from the VLMS were projected onto the building facades of the 3D map, and textures were generated automatically.

                A hierarchical terrain recovery approach for generating digital terrain models (DTM) from single and multiple returns lidar data is presented in this paper. The algorithm can intelligently discriminate between terrain and non-terrain points by using adaptive and robust filtering and interpolation techniques. It processes the image pyramid, bottom-up and top-down, to estimate high-quality terrain surfaces from lidar data with varying point densities and scene complexities. Using road and vegetation information, the algorithm is able to adaptively adjust thresholds to be suited to process changing contents in a large scene. The algorithms have been tested extensively using multiple medium- and highresolution lidar datasets. The worst-case error is below 25 cm Linear Error (LE) 90 comparing the derived DTMs and the raw range images on bare surfaces when testing several lidar datasets.

                Recent advances in technology and wider commercial applications have promoted the remote sensing and airborne mapping communities to take a closer look at digital imaging and its advantages over conventional film-based, large-format aerial photography. In this paper, we focus on the potential of high-resolution, digital color imagery acquired from an airborne small-format digital camera for rapid mapping of complex urban informal settlements. We discuss the example of automated building extraction using a novel color edge extractor developed with similarity-based color morphology and report on investigations into the use of this low-cost digital imaging option for rapid spatial data acquisition of informal settlements under dynamic conditions. Results from our work suggest that the approach taking advantage of color information to generate attributed edges to hypothesize shack roof outlines by exploiting the fuzzy similarity measure and color morphology is a potential new avenue to automatically extract buildings from high-resolution color digital imagery.

                In recent years, there has been a significant shift in the development of a Geographic Information System (GIS) from desktop applications to mobile field applications. By integrating the precision location data collection capability of Global Positioning System (GPS) and the spatial processing power of GIS, mobile GIS provides an ideal basis of building systems for field workers to collect data with increased efficiency and ease. This paper presents the design and implementation of a pavement distress data collection and management system for efficient airport pavement condition inspection with the aid of mobile GIS. The system seeks to streamline the field data collection process by offering a customized user interface for distress data entry, transformation, retrieval, and real-time transmission through wireless handheld devices. An R*-tree algorithm has been explored to index the distress data and speed up the retrieval of distress information when performing spatial and attribute searches. A least squares adjustment algorithm is also introduced in an effort to improve the precision of GPS data. Furthermore, a wireless communication algorithm has been developed to enable the transmission of distress data from the mobile client in the field to the in-house GIS server. On the side of hardware, Pocket PC has been chosen as the platform for deploying all field operations. Three peripheral devices, namely the GPS receiver, digital camera and wireless card, are attached to the Pocket PC for capturing distress location, digital photos and support wireless communication, respectively. The effectiveness and efficiency of the system have been tested and verified by various field trials in Singapore Changi International Airport.

                Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have become a crucial support tool for governmental decision makers at many levels. Internet-based GIS applications provide unique services for the presentation of spatial data and mapping products to a broad range of audiences. Furthermore, compact and portable mapping devices provide new opportunities for the expansion of Internet-based GIS applications. In this paper, we present results of the research and development of a web-based, mobile, spatial system for coastal management, and decision-making that integrates these technologies. The developed system consists of an on-site mobile spatial subsystem, a web-based shoreline erosion awareness subsystem, and a coastal structures permit subsystem. The system is designed and developed for applications in the Lake Erie area and has the potential to be adapted and applied in other coastal areas.

                The development of a mobile mapping system (MMS) to test the feasibility of automatic real-time identification and location of forest fire hot spots is discussed in this paper. The system combines an integrated inertial navigation system (INS) and Wide Area Differential Global Positioning System (WADGPS) with a thermal video imager and computer system. The overall objective of the system is to achieve an overall positioning accuracy of 2 m or better in real-time for the location of forest fire hot spots.The direct georeferencing model used in this system is briefly presented as well as how it is partitioned for implementing the real-time georeferencing of the thermal images and the final hot spot georeferencing. The paper then presents some specific issues affecting the identification, extraction, and tracking of forest fire hot spots from thermal images. Some of the hardware and software issues considered in designing the overall process flow for implementation as a real-time system are discussed next. Finally, an evaluation of the system’s potential real-time operation and georeferencing accuracy is presented.
