                Despite their vital role in terrestrial ecosystem function, the distributions and dynamics of soil microbial communities (SMCs) are poorly understood. Vegetation and soil properties are the primary factors that influence SMCs. This paper discusses the potential effectiveness of remote sensing science and technologies for mapping SMC biogeography by characterizing surface biophysical properties (e.g., plant traits and community composition) strongly correlated with SMCs. Using remotely sensed biophysical properties to predict SMC distributions is extremely challenging because of the intricate interactions between biotic and abiotic factors and between above- and below-ground ecosystems. However, the integration of biophysical and soil remote sensing with geospatial information about the environment holds great promise for mapping SMC biogeography. Additional research needs involve microbial taxonomic definition, soil environmental complexity, and scaling strategies. The collaborative effort of experts from diverse disciplines is essential to linking terrestrial surface biosphere observations with subsurface microbial community distributions using remote sensing.

                Eutrophication associated with high concentrations of phosphorus in Missisquoi Bay has raised concerns about its influence on submersed aquatic vegetation. Subaqueous soils could play an important role in nutrient cycling, algae blooms, the spread of invasive aquatic vegetation, and water quality. The objectives of this study were to (a) characterize some of the morphological, physical and chemical properties of subaqueous soils in Missisquoi Bay based on ground-penetrating radar and soil analysis; and (b) assess relationships among the subaqueous soil landscapes, radar facies, and submersed aquatic vegetation. Coarse Stratified Sediments and Lacustrine Silt radar facies associated with Delta/Nearshore and Lakebed/Bay Bottom subaqueous soil-landscape units covered 90 percent of the study area. The Lacustrine Silt radar facies occurred in relatively deep, low-energy, depositional areas and had the highest P concentrations. The majority of the submersed aquatic vegetation was associated with Delta/Nearshore and Fringing Peatland subaqueous soil landscapes under shallow water.

                This study presents spatial statistical methods for examining the distribution of soil moisture in a sub-alpine environment. The high local variability of soil moisture is not well characterized by spatial interpolation from dispersed data points. Interpolation using only field samples from Loch Vale, Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado produced coarse estimates that followed mean soil moisture trends, but failed to capture local mid-slope variation. A properly specified regression model was identified by using dispersed field samples and ancillary data derived from Ikonos-2 and lidar data. This model predicted soil moisture patterns at a much finer spatial resolution. An intensive field campaign provided independent soil moisture measurements that were used to assess the model’s accuracy. The modeled soil moisture estimates captured local variability associated with topographic terrain differences along mid-slope areas.

            Mapping Impervious Surfaces Using Object-oriented Classification in a Semiarid Urban Region

                Mapping the expansion of impervious surfaces in urbanizing areas is important for monitoring and understanding the hydrologic impacts of land development. The most common approach using spectral vegetation indices, however, is difficult in arid and semiarid environments where vegetation is sparse and often senescent. In this study object-oriented classification of high-resolution imagery was used to develop a cost-effective, semi-automated approach for mapping impervious surfaces in Sierra Vista, Arizona for an individual neighborhood and the larger sub-watershed. Results from the neighborhood-scale analysis show that object-oriented classification of QuickBird imagery produced repeatable results with good accuracy. Applying the approach to a 1,179 km2region produced maps of impervious surfaces with a mean overall accuracy of 88.1 percent. This study demonstrates the value of employing object-oriented classification of high-resolution imagery to operationally monitor urban growth in arid lands at different spatial scales in order to fill knowledge gaps critical to effective watershed management.

                Conventional soil maps (CSM) have provided baseline soil information for land use planning for over 100 years. Although CSM have been widely used, they are not suitable to meet growing demands for high resolution soil information at field scales. We present a repeatable method to disaggregate CSM data into ~30-meter resolution rasterized soil class maps that include continuous representation of probabilistic map uncertainty. Methods include training set creation for original CSM component soil classes from soil-landscape descriptions within the original survey database. Training sets are used to build a random forest predictive model utilizing environmental covariate maps derived from ASTER satellite imagery and the USGS National Elevation Dataset. Results showed agreement at 70 percent of independent field validation sites and equivalent accuracy between original CSM map units and the disaggregated map. Uncertainty of predictions was mapped by relating prediction frequencies of the random forest model and success rates at validation sites.

                Soil degradation by expansion-driven sealing increases at an unexpected rate globally, but the dynamics of agricultural soil sealing in peri-urban areas remain poorly understood. This study used aerial photographs to monitor patterns of built-up land expansion and subsequent agricultural soil sealing between 1994 and 2006 in peri-urban areas of Shanghai, China. Results indicated that a total of 152,706.5 ha of agricultural soils were sealed. In particular, residential land and industrial land were the major contributors. Buffer analysis demonstrated that agricultural soils with high proximity to roads and urban centers are more vulnerable to be sealed. Percentage of sealed agricultural soils of total agricultural soils had linear relationships with population growth and economic development. These results quantitatively document the impacts of urbanization on agricultural soil sealing. From a management perspective, we argue that the protection of agricultural soils should be integrated with urban planning efforts in China.
