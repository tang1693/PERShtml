                ASD spectroradiometer field measurements in the SWIR water absorption region are sometimes problematic due to atmospheric effects such as moisture in the air. The reduced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in these wavebands makes it difficult to diagnose water stress in tree foliage using spectroscopy. This paper investigates the SNR issue in the 1,350 to 1,410nm waveband using laboratory-based experiments and practical field measurements of mountainous tree foliage spectra. With laboratory spectra data, three empirical signal models along with a Gaussian bias model were tested and validated using noisy field spectra data. Results demonstrate that a combination of either a logistic or sigmoid signal model coupled with a Gaussian bias (residual) model (LOGGM and SIGGM complex signal models) can effectively describe reflectance behaviors in the spectral region of 1,350 to 1,410 nm of red cypress (Chaemacyparis formosensis) foliage and further show that our proposed approach is promising in restoration of field spectra measurements.

                Thermal information is a key parameter in numerous remote sensing applications and environmental studies. The aim of this study was to assess the improvement that incorporating the TIR band of the Landsat-5 TM sensor has in the classification of a large heterogeneous landscape located in the south of Spain. To incorporate the thermal data into the classification process, the TIR band (with spatial resolution of 120 m) was downscaled by means of a geostatistical method (Downscaling Cokriging) to achieve a spatial resolution of 30 meters. Then, the thermal information was evaluated for contribution to overall and per-class map accuracy using Random Forest classification. The addition of the TIR band to single-season and multi-seasonal Random Forest models leads to an increase in the overall accuracy of 10 percent and 5 percent, and to an increase in the kappa index of 10 percent and 5 percent, respectively. The increase in per-class kappa for the thermal, single-season, Random Forest model ranged from −3 percent to 47 percent and 0 percent to 12 percent for the thermal, multi-seasonal model.

                Navigation applications, among other location-based applications, that rely primarily on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) are subject to positioning uncertainties. This paper presents an integrated GNSS (IGNSS) QOS prediction methodology that can provide navigation applications with quality of GNSS positions on prospective roads in a selected route ahead of time. As a part of the methodology, this paper discusses the technique for simulating signal paths using lidar data and signal propagation models for predicting levels of satellite visibility, positional availability, and positional accuracy. Experiments were conducted, and the predicted results by IGNSS QOS were evaluated against reference data (GPS coordinates) at various environment settings. Evaluation results indicated that IGNSS QOS can predict positioning quality with reasonably a high level of confidence in open sky locations and with some uncertainties in obstructed locations.

                A new method is presented for elevation, latitude, and longitude decorrelation stretch of monthly averaged land surface temperature (LST) night imagery (MYD11C3). The 12 monthly LST images for the year 2008 are transformed using principal components analysis, and then elevation, latitude, and longitude predict, through a multiple linear regression model, the first two principal components (PC-1, PC-2) that accounts for the 95.2 percent of the variance. The PC-1, PC-2 predicted images accounts for the 81.3 percent of the variance. If dimension reduction (omit PC-1 and PC-2) is applied, then 14.2 percent of variance that is explained by the PC-1 and PC-2 residuals images and it is independent from elevation, latitude, and longitude, will be subtracted. Selective variance reduction reconstructs the imagery from the two residual images as well as PC-3 to PC-12 images. The reconstructed imagery presents the magnitude the standardized LST value per pixel deviates from the elevation, latitude, and longitude predicted.

                This study investigated the optimum pixel size for detecting vegetation spatial patterns in a complex environment where three different ecosystems (grassland, shrubland, and forest) are present. Wavelet analysis indicated that ground Leaf Area Index (LAI) along the study transect is significant at a scale of 8 m. Following the sampling theorem, 2 m would be an optimum pixel size to detect potentially important vegetation patterns (possible sensors include QuickBird 2.4 m and Ikonos 3.2 m). A QuickBird image was then acquired to evaluate its suitability to identify vegetation patterns for the study area. The LAI map derived from QuickBird WDRVI (Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index) showed distinct vegetation patterns among three ecosystems. These results confirmed that the dominant spatial scale of ground vegetation biophysical properties (e.g., LAI) can aid in the selection of appropriate image resolution for monitoring multiple ecosystems.

                A novel method which integrates polarimetric decomposition, object-oriented image analysis, and decision tree algorithms is presented for land-use and land-cover (LULC) classification using RADARSAT-2 polarimetric SAR (POLSAR) data. Polarimetric decomposition which is aimed at extracting polarimetric parameters related to the physical scattering mechanisms of the observed objects can be used to support the classification of POLSAR data. The main purposes of object-oriented image analysis are delineating image objects as well as extracting various textural and spatial features from image objects to improve classification accuracy. A decision tree algorithm provides an efficient way to select features and implement classification. Compared with the Wishart supervised classification which is based on the coherency matrix, the proposed method can significantly improve the overall accuracy and kappa value of LULC classification by 17.45 percent and 0.24, respectively. Further investigation was carried out on the contribution of polarimetric decomposition, object-oriented image analysis, and decision tree algorithms to the improvement achieved by the proposed method. The investigation shows that all these three methods contribute to the improvement achieved by the proposed method.
