                Edge detection in high-spatial-resolution remote sensing images (HSRIs ) is a key technology for automatic extraction, analysis, and understanding of image information. With respect to the problem of fake edges in image edge detection caused by image noise and the phenomenon of the same class objects reflecting different spectra, this article proposes a novel edge detection method for HSRIs by combin- ing superpixels with dual-threshold edge tracking. First, the image is smoothed using the simple linear iterative clustering algorithm to eliminate the influence of image noise and the phenomenon of the same class objects reflecting different spectra on image edge detec - tion. Second, initial edge detection results of the image are obtained using the dual-threshold edge tracking algorithm. Finally, the initial image edge detection results are post-processed by removing the burrs and extracting skeleton lines to obtain accurate edge detection results. The experimental results confirm that the proposed method outperforms the others and can obtain smooth, continuous, and single-pixel response edge detection results for HSRIs .

                Impervious surfaces are an essential component of our environment and are mainly triggered by human developments. Rapid urbanization and population expansion have increased Lahore's urban impervious surface area. This research is based on estimating the urban imper- vious surface area ( uisa ) growth from 1993 to 2022. Therefore, we aimed to generate an accurate urban impervious surfaces area map based on Landsat time series data on Google Earth Engine ( gee ). We have used a novel global impervious surface area index ( gisai ) for impervious surface area ( uisa ) extraction. The gisai accomplished significant results, with an average overall accuracy of 90.93% and an average kappa coefficient of 0.78. We also compared the results of gisai with Global Human Settlement Layer-Built and harmonized nighttime light ( ntl ) isa data products. The accuracy assessment and cross-validation of uisa results were performed using ground truth data on ArcGIS and gee. Our research findings revealed that the spatial extent of uisa increased by 198.69 km2from 1993 to 2022 in Lahore. Additionally, the uisa has increased at an average growth rate of 39.74 km2. The gisai index was highly accurate at extract- ing uisa and can be used for other cities to map impervious surface area growth. This research can help urban planners and policymak- ers to delineate urban development boundaries. Also, there should be controlled urban expansion policies for sustainable metropolis and should use less impermeable materials for future city developments.

                For remorte sensing image object detection tasks in the small object feature, extraction ability is insufficient and difficult to locate, and other problems. This paper proposes an improved algorithm for small object detection in remote sensing images based on a window self-attention mechanism. On the basis of You Only Look Once (YOLO)v5s, a shallow feature extraction layer with four times downsampling is added to the feature fusion pyramid and the window self-attention mechanism is added to the Path Aggregation Network. Experiments show that the improved model obtained the Mean Average Precision (mAP) of 78.3% and 91.8% on the DIOR and Remote Sensing Object Detection public data sets with frames per second of 65 and 51, respectively. Compared with the basal YOLOv5s network, the mAP has improved by 5.8% and 3.3%, respectively. Compared with other object detection methods, the detection accuracy and real-time performance have been improved.

                This study aims at applying the improved You Only Look Once V5s model for the assessment of regional poverty using remote sensing image target detection. The model was improved from structure, algorithm, and components. Objects in the remote sensing images were used to identify poverty, and the poverty alleviation situation could be predicted according to the existing detection results. The results showed that the values of Precision, Recall, mean Average Precision (mAP)@0.5, and[email protected]:0.95 of the model increased 7.3%, 0.7%, 1%, and 7.2%, respectively on the Common Objects in Context data set in the detection stage; the four values increased 3.1%, 2.2%, 1.3%, and 5.7%, respectively on the custom remote sensing image data set in the verification stage. The loss values decreased 2.6% and 37.4%, respectively, on the two data sets. Hence, the application of the improved model led to the more accurate detection of the targets. Compared with the other papers, the improved model in this paper proved to be better. Artificial poverty alleviation can be replaced by remote sensing image processing because it is inexpensive, efficient, accurate, objective, does not require data, and has the same evaluation effect. The proposed model can be considered as a promising approach in the assessment of regional poverty.
