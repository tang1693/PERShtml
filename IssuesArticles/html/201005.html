                An inexpensive and reproducible method for monitoring rangelands over the northern range (NR) of Yellowstone National Park was developed utilizing Landsat imagery. A 1999 map of rangeland vegetation communities was created using boosted classification tree analysis. The 1999 map and a 1985 image were utilized in a change vector analysis resulting in a classified map for 1985. Classification accuracies ranged from 72.30 percent to 83.65 percent for the 1999 map and 72.60 percent to 88.73 percent for the 1985 map, depending upon level of class detail, demonstrating that Landsat-class data can be effectively used for efficient change analysis that maintains accuracy while reducing compound error. Spatial patterns of change were compared to theories from other studies related to change in the NR and were found to be consistent with effects from fire suppression, precipitation, and urban growth but not with trophic cascade from wolves or beaver effects.

                The fast urban expansion has led to replacement of natural vegetation-dominated land surfaces by various impervious materials. This has a significant impact on the environment due to modification of heat energy balance. Timely understanding of spatiotemporal information of impervious surface has become more urgent as conventional methods for estimating impervious surface are very limited. In response to this need, this paper proposes a new index, normalized difference impervious surface index (NDISI), for estimating impervious surface. The application of the index to the Landsat ETM+ image of Fuzhou City and the ASTER image of Xiamen City in China has shown that the new index can efficiently enhance and extract impervious surfaces from satellite imagery, and the normalized NDISI can represent the real percentage of impervious surface. The index was further used as an indicator to investigate the impact of impervious surface on urban heat environment by examination of its quantitative relationship with land surface temperature (LST), vegetation, and water using multivariate statistical analysis. The result reveals that impervious surface has a positive exponential relationship with LST rather than a simple linear one. This suggests that the areas with high percent impervious surface will accelerate LST rise and urban heat island development.

                Cut-leaved teasel is an invasive weed thriving in roadside environments and needs to be detected for implementation of management programs. This study tested several commonly applied classifiers to map teasel with an aerial hyperspectral image along the Interstate Highway 70 in central Missouri. A teasel/non-teasel mask was first built to exclude dominant land-covers that had distinct spectral differences from teasel. The spectral angle mapping (SAM) had the best results of delineating teasel from herbaceous background with its user’s and producer’s accuracies of 80 to 90 percent. Large commission errors of teasel were observed in the probability-based maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) and spectral information divergence (SID) methods. Compared with a regular land-use/land-cover classification in an unsupervised/supervised hybrid method, the post-masking SAM had much easier process of training data collection and achieved similar accuracies. It could be an optimal approach for mapping teasel and other weeds in highway environments.

                Airborne laser scanning technology is primarily perceived as a means for gathering detailed three-dimensional information about the surface and objects on it. The dense 3D data contain information about surface features and geohazards, some of which are of subtle form. Geohazards are usually embedded within the terrain, and scarcely form distinct shape-transition to their surroundings; therefore their detection is challenging. We address in this paper detection of subtle terrain features and demonstrate it on collapse sinkholes. Collapse sinkholes are surface depressions whose formation has severe effect on the environment and on regional development. We present an autonomous model for their extraction and characterization. Sinkholes within the studied regions appear in various size, forms, from their embryonic to a well developed formation. The level of sinkhole detection is high, and as demonstrated, the model performs well under varying landforms and surface texture, with little influence on the correctness of the extracted sinkholes. As the results show, features of approximately 20 cm deep can be identified and separated from their surroundings in the data.

                Error estimates of lidar observations are obtained by applying the General Law of Propagation of Variances (GLOPOV) to the direct georeferencing equation. Within the formulation of variance propagation, the most important consideration is the values used to describe the error of the hardware component observations including the global positioning system, inertial measurement unit, laser ranger, and laser scanner (angular encoder noise and beam divergence). Data tested yielded in general, pessimistic predictions as 85 percent of residuals were within the predicted error level. Simulated errors for varying scan angles and altitudes produced horizontal errors largely influenced by IMU subsystem error as well as angular encoder noise and beam divergence. GPS subsystem errors contribute the largest proportion of vertical error only at shallow scan angles and low altitudes. The transformation of the domination of GPS related error sources to total vertical error occurs at scan angles of 23°, 13°, and 8° at flying heights of 1,200 m, 2,000 m, and 3,000 m AGL, respectively.

                This paper examines the positional accuracy of the declassified KH-9 Hexagon imagery and derived DEM. Aimed at geodesy and mapmaking, the KH-9 program (1973 to 1980) resulted in an image archive with worldwide stereo coverage at 6 to 9 m. We used six KH-9 images acquired in 1980 over two testfields in Central Asia. Using reseau marks on the scanned KH-9 frames, we found and corrected image distortions. In bundle orientation with Ground Control Points (GCPs) from QuickBird images, we achieved horizontal accuracies below 6 m for a flat terrain testfield and approximately 10 m for a mountainous terrain testfield. With three GCPs the image orientation horizontal accuracy degraded by only 20 percent. We generated a DEM from the KH-9 images and estimated its vertical accuracy using IceSAT laser altimetry data and an additional DEM from 1:25 000 topographic maps. The DEM RMSE was 6.18 m over flat terrain and 20.0 m over mountainous terrain.

                The integration of lidar data and aerial imagery is a promising approach for accurate building model generation. In this research, lidar data and stereo-aerial imagery are incorporated in the generation of complex polyhedral building models whose rooftops are bounded by straight lines. The process starts by utilizing lidar data for deriving building hypotheses and the initial boundaries of the planar patches constituting the buildings’ rooftops. The boundaries of these patches are then refined through the incorporation of stereo-aerial imagery while utilizing 3D geometric and spectral constraints. Precise building boundaries are derived through resolving feature matching problems and fully utilizing spectral information. Finally, an efficient manual mono-plotting procedure is introduced to remove incorrect and add missing boundaries. The performance of the developed procedures is evaluated through experimental results from real data where the correctness, completeness, and accuracy of the derived building models are evaluated through comparison with a manually generated DBM.

                Using a statistical simulation process, the behavior of the Accuracy Standards for Large Scale Maps (ASLSM) of the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing is analyzed according to the sample size, as well as the relation between the limiting errors (thresholds), stated by the standard as a root mean squared error, and the actual root mean squared error of the product. When the root mean squared error of the product equals the threshold of the standard the simulation results show the ASLSM is very restrictive, classifying 75 percent of products as Class 2 maps instead of Class 1 maps. If the variability of the product is greater or lesser than this threshold, results can be depicted by a family of acceptance curves. These curves can be employed by users to determine the sample size needed to limit their acceptance risk, but also by producers to analyze their rejection risk.
