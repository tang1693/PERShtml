                This paper presents a study on modeling fuzzy topological relations between uncertain objects in GIS. Quasi-coincidence and quasi-difference, which are used to distinguish the topological relations between fuzzy objects, and to indicate the effect of one fuzzy object on another in a fuzzy topology adopted for the development. Geometrically, features in GIS can be classified as point features, linear features, and polygon or region features. In this paper, we first introduce several basic concepts in fuzzy topology that will be used in this study. This is followed by several definitions of fuzzy points, fuzzy lines, and fuzzy regions for GIS objects. Next, the level at which one fuzzy object affects the other is modeled based on the sum and difference of the membership functions that are quasi-coincident and quasi-different, respectively. Finally, an applicable example of using quasi-coincidence and quasidifference based on the new definitions of fuzzy point, line and polygon is given.

                A semantic, statistical approach to reconciling data with different ontologies is introduced. It was applied to UK land cover datasets from 1990 and 2000 in order to identify land cover change. The approach combined expression of expert opinion about how the semantics of the two datasets relate with spectral homogeneity metadata. A sample of the changes identified was assessed by field validation. Change was identified in 41 percent of the visited parcels, and all of the false positives were found to be due to classification error in either dataset. Thus, the approach reliably identifies inconsistency between two datasets, and the results indicate the suitability of uncertainty formalisms. The inclusion of extensive objectlevel metadata by the data producers greatly facilitates practical solutions to problems of data interoperability.

                This paper presents a rigorous photogrammetric solution to model the uncertainty in the orientation of the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite IRS-1C/1D. These satellites have an on-board system for providing satellite position and orientation. The model utilizes this system information, together with payload geometry and control points, for estimating the uncertainty in orientation of the spacecraft. The attitude is modeled as roll, pitch, yaw bias, and a minimum of two ground control points are required to estimate this bias. Results are presented for 14 (PAN) data sets. The geographic coordinates of control points are obtained from 1:25000 and 1:50000 scale maps published by the Survey of India. The RMSE for all data sets are less than 35 meters; RMSE with GPS observed control points is nine meters. The result of the model with only system level information is also presented. The paper describes the concept, mathematical formulation, and results of the model with analysis.

                Block adjustment of high-resolution pushbroom satellite images, such as those collected by Ikonos, differs significantly from classical aerial triangulation. Error propagation in block adjustment of such images, and hence the final mapping accuracy, depends on multiple factors such as image collection geometry, image collection mode (mono or stereo), and distribution of ground control. This paper discusses the influence of these factors and presents a simplified method for accuracy pre-analysis of block adjustment of high-resolution satellite images. The proposed accuracy pre-analysis methodology is demonstrated using simulated monoscopic and stereo Ikonos image blocks, and the introduction of a cross strip is presented to demonstrate its effect on improving the accuracy of monoscopic blocks. The predictions of the pre-analysis model are validated using two real-world Ikonos mapping blocks.

            Error Analysis on Grid-Based Slope and Aspect Algorithms

                Slope and aspect are the most frequently used surface geomorphic parameters in terrain analysis. While derived from grid DEM, the parameters often display noticeable errors due to errors (a) in data, (b) inherent in data structure, and (c) created by algorithms. It has been observed that some controversial results were reported in evaluating the results by various slope and aspect algorithms, largely because of the variety in assessment methodology and the difficulties in separating errors in data and those generated by the algorithms. This paper reports the study that assesses and compares the results from numerous grid-based slope and aspect algorithms using an analytical approach. Tests were made based on artificial polynomial surfaces which can be defined by mathematical formulae, with controllable “added” data errors. By this approach, different algorithms were quantitatively tested and their error components were analyzed. Thus, their suitability and tolerance related to DEM data characteristics can be described.

            Uncertainty and Confidence in Land Cover Classification Using a Hybrid Classifier Approach

                Traditional methods of land cover classification and mapping are limited in providing spatial data on the uncertainty of map labels. In this paper, we present a hybrid classifier approach using Decision Tree (DT) and ARTMAP1neural network to providing confidence or uncertainty information via majority voting and other rules. The hybrid classifier is tested with AVHRR data to mapping land cover of North America. The two classifiers (DT and ARTMAP) tend to make predictive errors in different contexts. They show 68% agreement in classifying land cover of North America. A set of rules is developed to assign class labels for pixels where the two classifiers disagree. Levels of confidence in the hybrid classification derived from their individual voting (ARTMAP) and probability (DT) are used to assign confidence. The approach outlined in this paper produces two products—a hybrid classification map as well as a confidence map based on the two classification schemes. The hybrid approach seems suitable to tackle a variety of classification problems in remote sensing and may ultimately aid map users in making more informed decisions.

                It is common for modern geospatial libraries to contain multiple datasets that cover the same area but differ only in some specific quality attributes (e.g., resolution and precision). This is affecting the concept of content-based geospatial queries, as simple coverage-based query mechanisms (e.g., declaring a specific area of interest) as well as theme-based query mechanisms (e.g., requesting a black and white aerial photo or multispectral satellite imagery) are rendered inadequate to identify and access specific datasets in such collections. In this paper we introduce a novel approach to handle data quality attributes in geospatial queries. Our approach is characterized by the ability to model and learn user preferences, thus establishing user profiles that allow us to customize image queries for improving their functionality in a constantly diversifying geospatial user community.
