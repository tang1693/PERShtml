                This paper proposes an image segmentation algorithm based on fuzzy logic to detect road pixels in high-resolution satellite images. Other image classification and segmentation approaches require that the number of existing classes in the image scene be specified in advance. Additionally, supervised classification algorithms require sufficient samples from an image to identify the parameters of each class. The proposed method does not require specification of the number of classes. The mean and standard deviation of road pixels are automatically calculated using one up to three samples from its surface. This is an improvement on existing classification and segmentation methods. The proposed approach is tested on both simulated and real satellite images. A QuickBird color image is segmented into road and non-road zones using mean and standard deviation values calculated using the proposed method. Finally, advanced mathematical morphology algorithms are used to extract main road centerlines from the segmented image.

                Very few attempts have been made to qualify and quantify the contribution of fruits to the hyperspectral canopy signal. The interference of fruit may influence the effectiveness of spectral indices and radiative transfer models used to monitor leaf-related biochemical and biophysical parameters. In a series of experiments, the spectral characteristics (350 to 2,500 nm range) of fruit and its contributions to the canopy signature were investigated. Leaf, fruit, and canopy spectra were collected in a “Midknight Valencia” orange orchard, evaluated, and cross-referenced against biophysical and biochemical tree characteristics in order to gain a better insight in the contribution of citrus fruits to canopy spectral reflectance. Results indicate that the presence of fruits leads to major reflectance decreases in the infrared regions (700 to 2,500 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum. This may be explained by, on the one hand a partial obstruction of the volume scattering in the canopy, and on the other hand the significant contribution of the orange fruits to the overall equivalent canopy water thickness. In the visible (VIS: 350 to 700 nm) domain, the impact of the presence of fruit is much less evident. The occurrence of medium and heavy crop loads did not affect the visible reflectance signature significantly but was indirectly evidenced by leaf chlorosis mainly due to competition for nitrogen between the canopy elements. The knowledge gained from this study will contribute to better hyperspectral vegetation index design and improved radiative transfer models for fruit bearing perennial woody crops. What is more, the direct biochemical linkages between water, nitrogen, fruit biomass, and spectral characteristics are an important precursor for the development and implementation of an air- or space-borne crop load monitoring system for citrus orchards.

                Small footprint, full waveform airborne laser scanning provides the opportunity to derive high-resolution geometric and physical information simultaneously from a single scanner system. This study evaluates the influence of various factors on the shape of the returned waveform and investigates the possibility of improving terrain classification by applying waveform-derived information. The factors discussed are surface roughness, slope angle, scan angle, amplitude, and footprint size. It is statistically demonstrated that roughness is the most significant factor affecting pulse width, and that, over relatively smooth surfaces, there is no significant variation in pulse width behavior resulting from different footprint sizes. Pulse width also exhibits a relatively stable behavior when amplitude, range distance, or scan angle vary substantially. The overall accuracy of classification achieved by applying pulse width information over all the different land-cover types examined in this study (including scrub, hillside, single trees, and forest areas) was greater than 85 percent, with 94 percent achieved for open vegetation areas. Physical surface information provided by small footprint waveform data is considered to be at the microscale, therefore it is recommended to combine such information with geometry (e.g., filtering algorithms) for the optimal identification of terrain points.

                Network models, based on mathematical graph theory, are used in many fields, from chemistry and biology to ecology and sociology. A nominal-valued land-cover raster can be represented as a network in which patches are nodes connected by links if two patches are adjacent. Built with existing GIS technology, the system is applied to the largest patches of a raster for the Washington, D.C. area in order to provide a data structure that visualizes the gross spatial structure of the raster; provides information about the overall arrangement of the patches and their adjacencies; and generates new metrics about land-cover patterns, connectivity and spatial autocorrelation. The system facilitates the evaluation of land-cover classifications, the measurement of landscape change, comparisons of data from different regions, and the analysis of land/environmental interactions.

                This research evaluated the potential for using the MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) 16-day composite (MOD13Q) 250 m time-series data to develop an annual crop type mapping capability throughout the 480,000 km2Great Lakes Basin (GLB). An ecoregion-stratified approach was developed using a two-step processing approach that included an initial differentiation of cropland versus non-cropland and subsequent identification of individual crop types. Major crop types were mapped for the calendar years of 2002 and 2007. National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) census data were used to assess county level accuracies on a unit area basis (2002), and the NASS Crop Data Layer (CDL) was used to generate 231,616 reference data points to support a pixel-wise assessment of the MODIS crop type classification (2007) accuracy across the US portion of the GLB. County level comparisons for 2002 indicated 2.2, 6.8, 6.0, and 5.8 percent of area bias errors for corn, soybeans, wheat, and hay, respectively. Detailed pixel-wise accuracy assessments resulted in an overall crop type classification accuracy of 84 percent (Kappa 0.73) for 2007. Kappa coefficients ranged from 0.74 to 0.69 for individual ecoregions. The user’s accuracies for corn, soybean, wheat, and hay were 87, 82, 81, and 70 percent, respectively. There were spatial variations of classification performances across ecoregions, especially for soybean and hay. Field sizes had a direct impact on the variable classification performances across the GLB.

                Mapping of soil organic carbon (SOC) was accomplished with remote sensing methods to assess its spatial variability. The relationship between bi-directional reflectance measurements and SOC was investigated with respect to C.I.E. color coordinates. Empirical relationships were generated for the spectral detection of SOC of two semi-arid to arid study sites. These regression models allowed the prediction of SOC with a cross-validated r20.910 (RMSEcv2.825) and r2of 0.795 (RMSEcv2.113), respectively. Because C.I.E. color coordinates were found to be appropriate parameters for predicting the SOC, reflectance values of Landsat TM bands were transformed into C.I.E. color coordinates. The C.I.E. based regression models were applied to a Landsat image to estimate SOC in the spatial domain. Concentrations predicted from satellite data corresponded well with concentration ranges derived from chemical analysis. Estimated concentrations reflect the geographic conditions and depend on annual rainfall, with a general trend to decreasing SOC with increasing aridity.
