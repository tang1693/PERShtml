                Canopy surface data are desirable in forestry, but they are difficult to collect in the field. Existing surface reconstruction techniques cannot adequately extract canopy surfaces, especially for conifer stands. This paper develops an integrated model-based approach to reconstruct canopy surface for conifer stands analytically from the crown level. To deal with dense stands, critical problems are addressed in the process of model-based surface reconstruction. These include the occlusion problem in disparity (parallax) prediction from tree models, the edge effect of tree models on the disparity map, and the foreshortening effect in image matching. The model-based approach was applied to recover the canopy surface of a dense redwood stand using images scanned from 1:2,400-scale aerial photographs. Compared with field measurements, crown radius and tree height derived from the reconstructed canopy surface model have an overall accuracy of 92 percent and 94 percent, respectively. The results demonstrate the approach’s ability to reconstruct complicated stands.

                An orthophoto is a fundamental information source in forestry. Orthophoto production is usually based on digital elevation models (DEM); however, the elevations of 3D objects such as buildings and trees, which are visible in large-scale photos, are not included in DEMs. Recently initiated “true orthophoto” generation has been dedicated to urban scenes, removing the displacement caused by both the terrain and buildings. This paper reports an effort on reducing occlusion and distortion caused by trees in true orthoimage generation for forested areas. Canopy surface models (CSM) depicting both the terrain and tree surfaces were used in forest orthoimage production. Z-buffer techniques were incorporated into indirect orthoimage production to remove occlusion. An angle-based strategy was applied to composite multi-ocular images. The proposed techniques were applied in the generation of high-resolution orthoimages of a redwood stand with 1:2,400-scale aerial photos.

                A simple, lightweight, inexpensive, portable airborne laser profiling system has been assembled from off-the-shelf, commercially available components. The system, which costs approximately $30,000, is designed to fly aboard small helicopters and single- or twin-engine high-wing aircraft without airframe modification. The system acquires first-return range and amplitude measurements at data rates up to 2000 hz (operator-controlled) and has an operational envelope up to 300 m above terrain. The airborne laser profiling system includes the laser transmitter/receiver, differential GPS receiver, a CCD video camera and recorder, and a laptop computer which interleaves and records the GPS and laser range/amplitude data. The portable airborne laser system (PALS) was designed to acquire forest height measurements along linear flight transects in order to conduct regional or subcontinental forest inventories worldwide. This economical laser system now puts airborne laser mensuration within reach of operational foresters and researchers interested in making rapid forest structure and/or timber surveys in remote areas. PALS has been used to acquire over 5000 km of flight transect data over the state of Delaware.

                Performances of selected spatial methods are investigated for characterizing canopy disturbance in a reduced-impact logging operation in central Amazonia using Landsat-7 ETM+ and Ikonos visible, near-infrared, and normalized difference vegetation index data. Texture, fractal dimension (D), and Moran’s I index of spatial autocorrelation were calculated for (1) 10-ha plots representing logged (LF), logged excluding major roads and patios (L), and old-growth (OG) forest; and (2) 335-ha plots representing LF and OG.Ikonos data were sensitive to roads, patios, and some logging gaps, whereas ETM+ data were only sensitive to major logging features. The spatial methods were effective at characterizing the different logging feature treatments at both plot sizes; DTPSAand Moran’s I were most sensitive to fine-scale surface details. The spatial methods show potential for monitoring and management of logging activities over landscape scales. The importance of scale, given the ever-increasing choice of remotely sensed data, is emphasized.

                The identification and classification of mountain pine beetle,Dendroctonus ponderosae(Hopk ins), red-a ttack damag e patterns in a mature lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forest located in the Fort St. James Forest District, British Columbia, was accomplished using 1999 Landsat TM satellite imagery, 1999 mountain pine beetle field and aerial survey point data, and GIS forest inventory data. Unrelated variance in the observed spectral response at mountain pine beetle field and aerial survey points was reduced following image stratification with the GIS forest inventory data and removal of other factors uncharacteristic of red-attack damage. Locations of known mountain pine beetle infestation were used to train a maximum-likelihood algorithm; overall classification accuracy was 73 percent, based on an assessment of 360 independent validation points. If local stand variability is reduced prior to signature generation, accuracies and map products can be useful for those involved in active forest management decision-making regarding mountain pine beetle infestations.

                The accuracy of remotely sensed forest stand maps is tra ditionally assessed by comparing a sample of the map data with actual ground conditions. Samples most often comprise clusters of pixels within homogeneous areas, thereby avoiding problems associated with accurately mapping “edges” (e.g., transition areas between two forest types). Consequently, they may well overestimate accuracy, but the degree of overestima tion is unknown. This paper examines two important factors regarding accuracy assessment that are not well studied: the effect on estimates of accuracy of (1) the sampling method and (2) the exact placement of the samples. Overall accuracy, normalized accuracy, and the KHAT statistic are computed from error matrices generated from simple random sampling, stra tified random sampling, and systematic sampling using totally random sample placement and samples chosen from homog eneous areas only. The results indicate that Kappa appears to be as appropriate to use with systematic sampling and stratified random sampling as it is with simple random sam pling, but suggests that sample placement may have more of an effect on estimates of accuracy than sampling method alone.

                The 14,582 km2Neuse River Basin in North Carolina was characterized based on a user-defined land-cover (LC) classification system developed specifically to support spatially explicit, non-point source nitrogen allocation modeling studies. Data processing incorporated both spectral and GIS rule-based analytical techniques using multiple date SPOT 4 (XS), Landsat 7 (ETM+), and ancillary data sources. Unique LC classification elements included the identification of urban classes based on impervious surfaces and specific row crop type identifications. Individual pixels were aggregated to produce variable minimum mapping units or landscape “patches” corresponding to both riparian buffer zones (0.1 ha), and general watershed areas (0.4 ha). An accuracy assessment was performed using reference data derived fromin situfield measurements and imagery (camera) data. Multiple data interpretations were used to develop a reference database with known data variability to support a quantitative accuracy assessment of LC classification results. Confusion matrices were constructed to incorporate the variability of the reference data directly in the accuracy assessment process. Accuracies were reported for hierarchal classification levels with overall Level 1 classification accuracy of 82 percent (n = 825) for general watershed areas, and 73 percent (n = 391) for riparian buffer zone locations. A Kappa Test Z statistic of 3.3 indicated a significant difference between the two results. Classes that performed poorly were largely associated with the confusion of herbaceous classes with both urban and agricultural areas.

                Performances of selected spatial methods are investigated for characterizing canopy disturbance in a reduced-impact logging operation in central Amazonia using Landsat-7 ETM+ and Ikonos visible, near-infrared, and normalized difference vegetation index data. Texture, fractal dimension (D), and Moran’s I index of spatial autocorrelation were calculated for (1) 10-ha plots representing logged (LF), logged excluding major roads and patios (L), and old-growth (OG) forest; and (2) 335-ha plots representing LF and OG.Ikonos data were sensitive to roads, patios, and some logging gaps, whereas ETM+ data were only sensitive to major logging features. The spatial methods were effective at characterizing the different logging feature treatments at both plot sizes; DTPSAand Moran’s I were most sensitive to fine-scale surface details. The spatial methods show potential for monitoring and management of logging activities over landscape scales. The importance of scale, given the ever-increasing choice of remotely sensed data, is emphasized.

                The identification and classification of mountain pine beetle,Dendroctonus ponderosae(Hopk ins), red-a ttack damag e patterns in a mature lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forest located in the Fort St. James Forest District, British Columbia, was accomplished using 1999 Landsat TM satellite imagery, 1999 mountain pine beetle field and aerial survey point data, and GIS forest inventory data. Unrelated variance in the observed spectral response at mountain pine beetle field and aerial survey points was reduced following image stratification with the GIS forest inventory data and removal of other factors uncharacteristic of red-attack damage. Locations of known mountain pine beetle infestation were used to train a maximum-likelihood algorithm; overall classification accuracy was 73 percent, based on an assessment of 360 independent validation points. If local stand variability is reduced prior to signature generation, accuracies and map products can be useful for those involved in active forest management decision-making regarding mountain pine beetle infestations.

            Sampling Method and Sample Placement

                The accuracy of remotely sensed forest stand maps is tra ditionally assessed by comparing a sample of the map data with actual ground conditions. Samples most often comprise clusters of pixels within homogeneous areas, thereby avoiding problems associated with accurately mapping “edges” (e.g., transition areas between two forest types). Consequently, they may well overestimate accuracy, but the degree of overestima tion is unknown. This paper examines two important factors regarding accuracy assessment that are not well studied: the effect on estimates of accuracy of (1) the sampling method and (2) the exact placement of the samples. Overall accuracy, normalized accuracy, and the KHAT statistic are computed from error matrices generated from simple random sampling, stra tified random sampling, and systematic sampling using totally random sample placement and samples chosen from homog eneous areas only. The results indicate that Kappa appears to be as appropriate to use with systematic sampling and stratified random sampling as it is with simple random sam pling, but suggests that sample placement may have more of an effect on estimates of accuracy than sampling method alone.

                The 14,582 km2Neuse River Basin in North Carolina was characterized based on a user-defined land-cover (LC) classification system developed specifically to support spatially explicit, non-point source nitrogen allocation modeling studies. Data processing incorporated both spectral and GIS rule-based analytical techniques using multiple date SPOT 4 (XS), Landsat 7 (ETM+), and ancillary data sources. Unique LC classification elements included the identification of urban classes based on impervious surfaces and specific row crop type identifications. Individual pixels were aggregated to produce variable minimum mapping units or landscape “patches” corresponding to both riparian buffer zones (0.1 ha), and general watershed areas (0.4 ha). An accuracy assessment was performed using reference data derived fromin situfield measurements and imagery (camera) data. Multiple data interpretations were used to develop a reference database with known data variability to support a quantitative accuracy assessment of LC classification results. Confusion matrices were constructed to incorporate the variability of the reference data directly in the accuracy assessment process. Accuracies were reported for hierarchal classification levels with overall Level 1 classification accuracy of 82 percent (n = 825) for general watershed areas, and 73 percent (n = 391) for riparian buffer zone locations. A Kappa Test Z statistic of 3.3 indicated a significant difference between the two results. Classes that performed poorly were largely associated with the confusion of herbaceous classes with both urban and agricultural areas.
