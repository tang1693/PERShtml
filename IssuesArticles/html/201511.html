                A method for the autonomous geolocation of ground vehicles in forest environments is presented. The method provides an estimate of the global horizontal position of a vehicle strictly based on finding a geometric match between a map of observed tree stems, scanned in 3D by Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) sensors onboard the vehicle, to another stem map generated from the structure of tree crowns analyzed from high resolution aerial orthoimagery of the forest canopy. The method has been tested with real-world data and has been able to estimate vehicle geoposition with an average error of less than 2 m. The method has two key properties that are significant: (a) The algorithm does not requirea prioriknowledge of the area surrounding the robot, and (b) Based on estimated vehicle state, it uses the geometry of detected tree stems as the only input to determine horizontal geoposition.

                We propose an algorithm for the automatic co-registration of Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) camera video images with 3D wireframe models. The proposed method automatically retrieves changing camera focal length and angular parameters, due to the motion of PTZ cameras by matching linear features between PTZ video images and 3D CAD wireframe models. The developed feature-matching schema is based on a novel evidence-based hypothesis-verification optimization framework referred to as Line-based Randomized RAN dom SA mple Consensus (LR-RANSAC). LR-RANSAC introduces a fast and stable pre-verification test into the optimization process to avoid unnecessary verification of erroneous hypotheses. An evidence-based verification follows to optimally select the PTZ camera parameters, where an original line-based approach for full-verification, -exploiting local geometrical cues on the image scene-, evaluates the pre-verified hypotheses. Tests on an indoor dataset produced a 0.06 mm error in focal length estimation and rotational errors in the order of 0.18° to 0.24°. Experiments on the outdoor dataset resulted in a 0.07 mm error for focal length and rotational errors ranging from 0.19° to 0.30°.

                Given the close relationship between surface melt in polar areas and ice surface temperature (IST), it is important to develop an effective IST retrieval method. However, the studies concerning this topic are relatively limited. In this context, this paper proposes an effective approach to retrieve IST in the Antarctic area by presenting a modified split-window algorithm (SWA) and introducing a polynomial fitting for atmospheric transmittance simulation. The effectiveness was quantitatively validated by a comparative study with a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) IST product (MOD29) and automatic weather station (AWS) data. The comparisons indicated that the proposed method shows a robust performance in Antarctic IST retrieval for MODIS data: the bias was –0.61 K and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 1.32 K for the Zhongshan Station data set; the bias was –1.62 K and the RMSE was 2.34 K for the Ross Ice Shelf data set.
