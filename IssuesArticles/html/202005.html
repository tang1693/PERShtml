                Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and structure-from-motion photogrammetry are transforming the way we produce topo- graphic data, with applications covering many disciplines in the geosciences, including coastal studies. To overcome limitations of ground control points (GCPs), we evaluate direct georeferencing (DG) of consumer UAS imagery for the cost-effective measurement of beach topography. Using DG, camera positions determined with on-board instruments provide air control points for photogrammetry, obviating the need for presurveyed GCPs. We validate the approach at Orewa Beach, New Zealand, achieving vertical accuracies similar to light detection and ranging (< 0.2 m) at a higher resolution (< 0.1 m). A low-quality global navigation satellite system onboard a consumer UAS remains the main constraint on measurement quality. We show how independent topo- graphic data sets, which are increasingly available world- wide, can improve measurement quality, and hence change detection capacity. Our understanding of measurement quality achieved in this study is applied to the assessment of morphological and volumetric change at Orewa Beach.

                Recently, global structure from motion has successfully gained many followers, mainly because of its computational speed. Most of these global methods take the parameters of relative orientation (ROs ) as input and then perform averaging operations. Therefore, eliminating incorrect ROs is of great significance for improving the robustness of global structure from motion. In this article, we propose a method to eliminate wrong ROs which have resulted from repetitive structure and very short baselines. We present two corresponding criteria that indicate the quality of ROs. Repetitive structure is detected based on counts of conjugate points of the various image pairs, while very short baselines are found by inspecting the intersection angles of corresponding image rays. By analyzing these two criteria, we detect and eliminate incorrect ROs. As correct ROs of image pairs with a longer baseline nearly parallel to both viewing directions can be valuable, a method to identify and keep these ROs is also part of our approach. We demonstrate the new method on various data sets, including public benchmarks as well as close-range images and images from unmanned aerial vehicles, by inserting our refined ROs into a global structure-from-motion pipeline. The experiments show that compared to other methods, we can generate the best results.

                This article presents a novel strategy for improving the well-established component substitution-based multispectral image fusion methods, because the fused results obtained by component substitution methods tend to exhibit significant spectral distortion. The main cause of spectral distortion is analyzed and discussed based on the component substitution method's general model. An improved scheme is derived from the sensitivity imaging model to refine the approximate spatial detail and obtain one that is almost ideal. The experimental results on two data sets show that when it has been integrated into the Gramâ€“Schmidt method and the generalized intensity-hue-saturation method, the proposed scheme allows the production of fused images of the same spatial sharpness as standard implementations but with significantly increased spectral quality. Quantitative scores and visual inspection at full resolution and spatially reduced resolution confirm the superiority of the improved methods over the conventional algorithms.
