                High-density residential area modeling is extremely difficult because many houses reside close to or even touch each other; it usually causes the error of under segmentation. Our method solves this issue through scale detection and dome reshaping. A modified granulometry usingopening-by-reconstructioninstead ofopeningis proposed to detect the principle scales of the buildings. A morphological filtering algorithm at the detected continuous scales is developed to decompose a house into reshaped slices, which will be reconstructed as a dome. Thus, the domes are separate despite the joined houses, and are used to extract the markers of the houses. Finally, processes based on markers are developed to segment and model the houses. Among which, the multiple spectral image is used to detect the trees in the scene. Compared with other extraction methods, our technique decreases the fragment rate from 7.4 percent to 0.9 percent, the mixing rate from 14.8 percent to 0.9 percent.

                The process of efficient and effectiveDEMmerging is increasingly becoming more important. To allowDEManalysis for features of different scales, an increase in surface coverage cannot result in reduced measurement resolution. It is thus inevitable that merging individual high-resolutionDEMs will become common practice for applications such as hydraulic roughness studies for fluvial surfaces. This paper presents an efficient and effective merging solution, whereby accurate co-registration of individualDEMs collected from consistent viewpoints and standard averaging for overlapping elevations ensure seamless merging. The presented method is suitable forDEMs collected using any measurement technology, as long as individualDEMs overlap and are arranged on regular grids. The merging solution is applied to the study of a laboratory gravel bed measured with vertical stereo photogrammetry at the grain scale (>106points/m2). We show that the approach can be integrated into theDEMcollection workflow at the design stage, which optimizes the measurement performance. We present how resampling before merging can be beneficial to keep data handling requirements practical, whilst ensuring accurate surface representation. Finally, the effect of scale variation is studied, showing that seamless merging applies toDEMs with variable resolution.

                The objective of this study is to develop a method based on multivariate relevance vector regression (MVRVR) as a kernel-based Bayesian model for the estimation of above-ground biomass (AGB) in the Hyrcanian forests of Iran. FieldAGBdata from the Hyrcanian forests and multi-temporalPALSARback-scatter values are used for training and testing the methods. The results of theMVRVRmethod are then compared with other methods: multivariate linear regression (MLR), multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), and support vector regression (SVR). TheMLRmodel showed lower values of R2 than the three other approaches. Although theSVRmodel was found to be more accurate thanMLPNN, it had the lowest saturation point of 224.75 Mg/ha. The use ofMVRVRmodel significantly improves the estimation ofAGB(R2= 0.90;RMSE= 32.05 Mg/ha), and the model showed a superior performance in estimatingAGBwith the highest saturation point (297.81 Mg/ha).

            Discriminating Spectral Signatures Among and Within Two Closely Related Grapevine Species

                Several North American Vitis species are used to breed scions and rootstocks, including V. riparia and V. rupestris. However, the degree to which Vitis species can be distinguished using remote sensing is not well known. Here we explore whether two North American Vitis species and genotypes growing in a common garden can be discriminated with leaf and canopy hyperspectral reflectance factor data (350-2500 nm) using independent t-test and derivative analysis. Foliar properties and spectral indices of the grapevines were evaluated with analysis of the variance (ANOVA) and pair-wise Bonferroni adjusted t-tests. The results showed that V. riparia and V. rupestris can be distinguished at the leaf level spectra of visible, near- and infrared spectral regions. At the canopy level, genotypes were spectrally discriminated with limited success. The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) demonstrated the highest potential not only to differentiate two species, but also two genotype pair groups within V. rupestris. This finding was also true for the PRI calculated with simulated EO-1 Hyperion data. These capacities to distinguish Vitis species, and to a lesser extent genotypes, using spectral signatures have important applications in remote monitoring of vineyards for plants health and also for locating wild Vitis populations for future crop improvement efforts.

                High-resolution land-use and land-cover (LULC) and impervious surface maps were traditionally created by time-consuming field surveys or aerial photo interpretation and digitizing methods. In the United States, the recent availability of 1 m digital color orthoimagery through the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) offers an opportunity to update land cover maps for areas of interest. In this study, an object-based feature extraction and a regression tree technique were applied to theNAIPimagery for the Twin Cities Metropolitan Areas (TCMA) of Minnesota. An overall accuracy of 74 percent and 95 percent was achieved for the generalLULCclassification and the impervious surface map, respectively. It was found that both techniques could be used to extract impervious surfaces from theNAIPimagery with relatively high accuracy. TheLULCclassification results were compared to the 2006 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and another Landsat-based 2006 classification. Implications for future classification studies were also discussed.
