                Although traditional and web map producers strive to deliver up-to-date products and old aerial photographs do not fit in their concept, other users are rather interested in old aerial images and in temporal series. In Portugal, aerial surveys for mapping purposes started by the late thirties of the twentieth century as documented by the oldest existing aerial photos collection in the archives of the IGEOE in Lisbon. Being the oldest visual witnesses of the country, the relevance of the information they contain is unquestionable. The objective of this project is the recovery of an important national aerial photographic heritage hibernating in analogue format in the archives. In a test block, strategies to recover radiometry and spatial orientation were developed and successfully tested in order to make the photos accessible and workable by the modern scientific community and by the general public. A photo-geographic database has also been organized and made available.

                Within this paper, results of a test on the evaluation of the most recent photogrammetric digital airborne camera systems are presented. This project was initiated by the German Society of Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Geoinformation (DGPF), based on data from 12 different digital sensor systems flown in a well-controlled test site. The main topics of the evaluation phase are the analysis of geometric accuracy and sensor calibration, the radiometric performance including on-site radiometric calibration and multi-spectral land classifications, the performance of photogrammetric Digital Surface Model (DSM) generation, and the potential of manual stereoplotting from digital images. Within this paper, only results obtained at the Institute of Photogrammetry (IFP), Universitaet Stuttgart will be presented, comprehensively proving the high performance of digital camera systems and processing. The IFP served as the pilot center and additionally concentrated on the investigation of camera geometry and the image based generation of height data.

                Important considerations for large scale mapping from satellite images are information content and geometric fidelity. Cartosat series of satellites with stereo mapping capability have become the mainstay towards large scale mapping for urban and rural applications. Algorithms for processing of high-resolution Indian remote sensing satellite data has been developed at ADRIN and is used for operational generation of data products. Variations in the sensor model with respect to the viewing geometries of Cartosat-1 and Cartosat-2 are explained in the paper. Finally, an assessment of the mapping potential of the satellites is discussed. The geometric accuracy achieved from Cartosat-1 and Cartosat-2 images over the same checkpoints are compared. DEM, geometric accuracy, and capability for topographic feature capture are good enough for making 1:10 000 and 1:7 000 scale maps from Cartosat-1 and Cartosat-2, respectively. Based on the error estimation and analysis, it is concluded that if the strict photogrammetric processing model and ground control points are employed, high-resolution satellite imagery can be used for the generation and update of topographic maps of scale 1:10 000 and larger.

                The extraction of the third dimension from remote sensing data is a well known technique. Since in a number of countries aerial images and laser scanner data are unavailable, expensive or classified, stereoscopic high-resolution optical satellite images provide a viable alternative for generating digital surface and digital terrain models. Especially the automatic extraction of highly accurate 3D surface models in urban areas is still a very complicated task due to occlusions, large differences in height and the variety of objects and surface material.In this paper an analysis and a visual and quantitative comparison of three different matching algorithms for generating urban DSMs based on very high-resolution satellite images is presented. The three algorithms are least squares matching (LSM) in a region growing fashion, dynamic programming (DP) and semiglobal matching (SGM). The characteristics of the three algorithms as applied to four different Ikonos stereo pairs with a ground sampling distance of 1 m are shown. The following results were obtained: visually, in the LSM results the shape of the buildings is considerably smoothed. While in the DP results the building shape is sharper, only little detail is visible on the building roofs, and streaking along the epipolar lines causes problems. With SGM more details can be extracted and the results visually have the best quality. Based on reference data for the different test sites, the standard deviation of the building heights determined by LSM and DP is in the range of one pixel or slightly better, while it is in the range of half a pixel for SGM.

                The analysis of laser scanner data is of great interest for gaining geospatial information. Especially for segmentation, classification, or visualization purposes, the intensity measured with a laser scanner device can be helpful. For automatic intensity normalization, various aspects are of concern, like beam divergence and atmospheric attenuation, both depending on the range. Additionally, the intensity is influenced by the incidence angle between beam propagation direction and surface orientation. To gain the surface orientation, the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix for object points within a nearby environment are determined. After normalization the intensity does no longer depend on the incidence angle and is influenced by the material of the surface only. For surface reflection modeling, (a) the Lambertian, (b) the extended Lambertian, and (c) the Phong reflection model are introduced, to consider diffuse and specular backscattering characteristics of the surface. An airborne measurement campaign was carried out to investigate the influences of the incidence angle on the measured intensity. For investigations, 17 urban areas, such as traffic, building, and vegetation regions were studied and the derived improvements are depicted. The investigation shows that large intensity variation caused by the object surface orientation and the distance between sensor and object can be normalized by utilizing the standard Lambertian reflection model

                This paper is focused on the potential and limits of Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI), a powerful remote sensing technique used to measure deformation phenomena. It only refers to satellite-based PSI techniques, focusing on the most important sources of C-band SAR data: ERS and Envisat. In addition, it compares C- and X-band results, considering data from the high-resolution TerraSAR-X sensor. The paper begins with a description of the main characteristics of PSI. It then discusses the most important PSI products and their performances, analyzing their spatial sampling, the so-called residual topographic error and PSI geocoding, the average displacement rates, and the deformation time series. As C-band products are concerned, the paper reports some relevant PSI validation results, which come from the ESAfunded Terrafirma Validation Project. Regarding the X-band, it describes the results obtained over the City of Barcelona by processing 13 TerraSAR-X images. The last part discusses the main limits of PSI.

                In TerraSAR-X spotlight data features of man-made objects in urban areas become visible. In a case study, this paper presents results of a precision and geometrical accuracy investigation of extracted double-bounce lines in SAR images. Two TerraSAR-X (TSX) acquisitions of a complex urban scene are compared to simulated SAR images. Using a new line detection method, double-bounce lines are extracted from simulated and real imagery with sub-pixel accuracy. The deviation of an extracted double-bounce line polygon with regard to both an interpolated line and ground truth is analyzed and discussed. First, it is shown that Gaussian functions model the deviation of the interpolated line from the polygon sufficiently well. Second, the absolute geometrical accuracy of the extracted double-bounce lines is evaluated with respect to ground truth. Results of the case study confirm that double-bounce lines provide reliable geometrical information, for instance, for building extraction and SAR image classification.

            Complex-Valued Multi-Layer Perceptrons – An Application to Polarimetric SAR Data

                Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are powerful function approximators. In the last decades they were successfully applied to many different regression and classification problems. Their characteristics and convergence properties are well studied and relatively well understood, but they were originally designed to work with real-valued data. The main focus of this paper is the classification of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (POLSAR) data which are a complexvalued signal. Instead of using an arbitrarily projection of this complex-valued data to the real domain, the paper proposes the usage of complex-valued MLPs (CV-MLPs), which are an extension of MLPs to the complex domain. The paper provides a detailed yet general derivation of the complex backpropagation algorithm and mentions related problems as well as possible solutions. Furthermore, it evaluates the performance of CV-MLPs in a land-cover classification task in POLSAR images under several learning conditions, and compares the proposed classifier with standard methods. The experimental results show that CV-MLPs are successfully applicable to classification tasks in POLSAR data. They show good convergence properties and a better performance if compared to real-valued MLPs.
