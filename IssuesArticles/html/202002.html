                To mitigate instantaneously evolving biases in satellite retrievals, a stochastic approach is applied over West Africa. This stochastic approach independently self-corrects Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) wet biases, unlike the cumulative density function (CDF) matching that rescales satellite retrievals with respect to several years of reference data. Ranked probability skill score (RPSS) is used as nonlocal root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) to assess stochastic retrievals. Stochastic method successfully decreasesRMSEsfrom 0.146 m3/m3to 0.056 m3/m3in the Republic of Benin and from 0.080 m3/m3to 0.038 m3/m3in Niger, while theCDFmatching method exacerbates the originalSMOSbiases up to 0.141 m3/m3in Niger, and 0.120 m3/m3in Benin. Unlike theCDFmatching or European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA))–interim soil moisture, only a stochastic retrieval responds to Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission rainfall. Based on the effects of bias correction, RPSS is suggested as a nonlocal verification without needing local measurements.

                The social-economic statistics collected from local governments are the main access for the central government to achieve national economic circumstance, especially for China. However, the statistics of almost 10% of national counties are missing or inconsistent due to the statistical caliber change in the wave of urbanization during economic development. Some researchers proposed to apply a night luminosity product to solve such issue. However, it lacks the ability to distinguish between the wealthy populations with a dense distribution and the less developed places. In this paper, the publicly available daytime Landsat images are used to estimate economic statistics. An end-to-end multi-task deep learning framework is constructed to estimate the county-level economy of Mainland China and the overall accuracy of this model achieves higher than 85%. The experiments show that our model provides a potential strategy to make up for the missing statistics and examines the reliability of the statistics collected for the central government.

                A collection of spectral indices, derived from a range of remote sensing imagery spatial resolutions, are compared to on-farm measurements of maize chlorophyll content and yield at two trial farms in central Malawi to evaluate what spatial resolutions are most effective for relating multispectral images with crop status. Single and multiple linear regressions were tested for spatial resolutions ranging from 7 cm to 20 m using a small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) and satellite imagery from Planet,SPOT6, Pléiades, and Sentinel-2. Results suggest that imagery with spatial resolutions nearer the maize plant scale (i.e., 14–27 cm) are most effective for relating spectral signals with crop health on smallholder farms in Malawi. Consistent with other studies, green-band indices were more strongly correlated with maize chlorophyll content and yield than conventional red-band indices, and multivariable models often outperformed single variable models.

                Owing to poor descriptiveness, weak robustness, and high computation complexity of local shape descriptors (LSDs), point-cloud registration in the case of partial overlap and object recognition in a cluttered environment are still challeng- ing tasks. For this purpose, anLSDis developed in this article by proposing a new local reference frame (LRF) method and designing a novel feature representation. In theLRFmethod, two weighting methods are applied to obtain robustness to noise, point-density variation, and incomplete shape. Additionally, a vector representation is calculated to disambiguate the sign of the x-axis. The feature representation encodes the local information by generating the local coordinate images from five views. Thus, more geometric and spatial information is included in the descriptor. Finally, the performance of theLRFmethod and theLSDis evaluated on several popular data sets. The experimental results demonstrate well that theLRFis robust to noise, point-density variation, and incomplete shape, and theLSDholds strong robustness, superior descriptiveness, and high computational efficiency.
