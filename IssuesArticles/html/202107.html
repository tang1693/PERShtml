                Three-dimensional reconstruction from a single image has excellent future prospects. The use of neural networks for three-dimensional reconstruction has achieved remarkable results. Most of the current point-cloud-based three-dimensional reconstruction networks are trained using nonreal data sets and do not have good generalizability. Based on the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago ()data set of large-scale scenes, this article proposes a method for processing real data sets. The data set produced in this work can better train our network model and realize point cloud reconstruction based on a single picture of the real world. Finally, the constructed point cloud data correspond well to the corresponding three-dimensional shapes, and to a certain extent, the disadvantage of the uneven distribution of the point cloud data obtained by light detection and ranging scanning is overcome using the proposed method.

                Bundle adjustment (BA) is a technique for refining sensor orientations of satellite images, while adjustment accuracy is correlated with feature matching results. Feature matching often contains high uncertainties in weak/repeat textures, while BA results are helpful in reducing these uncertainties. To compute more accurate orientations, this article incorporates BA and feature matching in a unified framework and formulates the union as the optimization of a global energy function so that the solutions of the BA and feature matching are constrained with each other. To avoid a degeneracy in the optimization, we propose a comprised solution by breaking the optimization of the global energy function into two-step suboptimizations and compute the local minimums of each suboptimization in an incremental manner. Experiments on multi-view high-resolution satellite images show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art orientation techniques with or without accurate least-squares matching.

                The spatiotemporal evolution of an impervious surface (IS) is significant for urban planning. In this paper, the IS was extracted and its spatiotemporal evolution for the Chengdu urban area was analyzed based on Landsat imagery. Our experimental results indicated that convolutional neural networks achieved the better performance with an overall accuracy of 98.32%, Kappa coefficient of 0.98, and Macro F1 of 98.28%, and the farmland was replaced by IS from 2001 to 2017, and the IS area (ISA) increased by 51.24 km2; that is, the growth rate was up to 13.8% in sixteen years. According to the landscape metrics, the IS expanded and agglomerated into large patches from small fragmented ones. In addition, the gross domestic product change of the secondary industry was similar to the change of ISA between 2001 and 2017. Thus, the spatiotemporal evolution of IS was associated with the economic development of the Chengdu urban area in the past sixteen years.

            Optimizing the Segmentation of a High-Resolution Image by Using a Local Scale Parameter

                Image segmentation is a critical procedure in object-based identification and classification of remote sensing data. However, optimal scale-parameter selection presents a challenge, given the presence of complex landscapes and uncertain feature changes. This study proposes a local optimal segmentation approach that considers both intersegment heterogeneity and intrasegment homogeneity, uses the standard deviation and local Moran's index to explore each optimal segment across different scale parameters, and combines the optimal segments into a single layer. The optimal segment is measured by using high-spatial-resolution images. Results show that our approach out-performs and generates less error than the global optimal segmentation approach. The variety of land cover types or intrasegment homogeneity leads to segment matching with the geo-objects on different scales. Local optimal segmentation demonstrates sensitivity to land cover discrepancy and provides good performance on cross-scale segmentation.

                Urban spectral indices have made promising improvements in the last two decades in urban land use land cover studies through mapping, estimation, change detection, time-series analyzing, urban dynamics, monitoring, modeling, and so on. Remote sensing spectral indices are unsupervised, unbiased, rapid, scalable, and quantitative in information extraction. Hence, we aimed to summarize the most relevant urban spectral indices by focusing on multispectral, thermal, and nighttime lights indices. We use the search terms "urban index", "built-up index", "normalized difference built-up area (NDBI )", "impervious surface index", and "spectral urban index" to collect relevant literature from the "Web of Science Core Collection" database. We found that all urban spectral indices developed since 2003, except NDBI. This review will help understand the applications of urban spectral indices, the selection of indices based on available spectral bands, and their merits and demerits.
