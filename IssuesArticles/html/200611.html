                Identification of the onset of vegetation greenup is a key-factor in characterizing and monitoring vegetation dynamics over large areas. However, the relationship between greenup onset dates estimated from satellite imagery and the actual growth stage of vegetation is often unclear. Herein, we present an approach for comparing pixel-level dnset dates to regional planting and emergence information for agricultural crops, with the goal of drawing reliable conclusions regarding the physical growth stage of the vegetation of interest at the time of greenup onset. To accomplish this, we calculated onset of greenup using modis 250 m, 16-day composite NDVl time series data for Kansas for 2001 and a recently proposed methodology for greenup detection. We then evaluated the estimated greenup dates using the locations of 1,417 large field sites that were planted to corn, soybeans, or sorghum in 2001, in conjunction with United States Department of Agriculture (usda) weekly crop progress reports containing crop planting and emergence percentage estimates.Average greenup onset dates calculated for the three summer crops showed that the dates were consistent with the relative planting order of corn, sorghum, and soybeans across the state. However, the influence of pre-crop vegetation (weeds and "volunteer" crops) introduced an early bias for the greenup onset dates calculated for many field sites. This pre-crop vegetation signal was most pronounced for the later planted summer crops (soybeans and sorghum) and in areas of Kansas that receive higher annual precipitation. The most reliable results were obtained for corn in semi-arid western Kansas, where pre-crop vegetation had considerably less influence on the greenup onset date calculations. The greenup onset date calculated for corn in western Kansas was found to occur 23 days after 50 percent of the crop had emerged. Corn’s greenup onset was detected, on average, at the agronomic stage where plants are 15 to 45 cm (6 to 18 inches) tall and the crop begins its rapid growth.

                The SRTM dataset is available at the USGS seamless website with one arc-second pixel spacing for the U.S. Recently, the value for horizontal resolution has been questioned. One paper (Smith and Sandwell, 2003) suggests that 60 meters may be more accurate, implying that the resolution is twice the provided spacing. For users of this data, the horizontal resolution is very important for their analyses. Hence, this paper addresses this important question by using two different approaches: coherence spectra and step-response. The coherence spectra approach uses statistical techniques to compare the SRTM dataset against a more accurate one, while the step response approach uses the observed step response in many areas of the dataset to estimate the width of the averaging function used to produce the SRTM data.Results from this study show that the resolution is between 1 and 1.6 pixels, depending on the local variability of the elevation data; with higher resolution near sharp edges and corners, and lower resolution in smoother areas.

                This paper puts forward a pixel-based and a region-based method for detecting land-use changes using a multi-temporal pair of satelliteKVRpanchromatic and aerial Daedalus multispectral images. These methods, based on fuzzy logic, provide a confidence level of their post-classification change detection results.They were applied to support an early stage of mine clearance in Croatia, where mines laid during the latest conflict (1991 to 1995) cause disruption in the land-use evolution. They were used for locating the agricultural land that was abandoned during the war and is therefore considered as a mine contamination indicator. The mere location of the abandoned agricultural land is of limited use for supporting mine clearance. On the other hand, the integration of the location and spatial confidence level can help the mine experts in their decision making by evaluating both unlikelihood and likelihood of a plot of land to be abandoned.

                Epipolar resampling aims at generating normalized images where conjugate points are located along the same row. Such a characteristic makes normalized imagery important for many applications such as automatic image matching, aerial triangulation, DEM and ortho-photo generation, and stereo-viewing. Traditionally, the input media for the normalization process are digital images captured by frame cameras. These images could be either derived by scanning analog photographs or directly captured by digital cameras. Current digital frame cameras provide smaller format imagery compared to those of analog cameras. In this regard, linear array scanners are emerging as a viable substitute to two-dimensional digital frame cameras. However, linear array scanners have more complex imaging geometry than that of frame cameras. In general, the imaging geometry of linear array scanners produces non-straight epipolar lines. Moreover, epipolar resampling of captured scenes according to the rigorous model, which faithfully describes the imaging process, requires the knowledge of the internal and external sensor characteristics as well as a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the object space. Recently, parallel projection has emerged as an alternative model approximating the imaging geometry of high altitude scanners with narrow angular field of view. In contrast to the rigorous model, the parallel projection model does not require the internal or the external characteristics of the imaging system and produces straight epipolar lines. In this paper, the parallel projection equations are modified for better modeling of linear array scanners. The modified parallel projection model is then used to resample linear array scanner scenes according to epipolar geometry. Experimental results using Ikonos and SPOT data demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed methodology.

                Detailed GIS studies across spatially complex rangeland landscapes, including the Aspen Parkland of western Canada, require accurate digital elevation models (DEM). Following the interpolation of last return lidar (light detection and ranging) data into a DEM, a series of 256 reference plots, stratified by vegetation type, slope and lidar sensor sampling angle, were surveyed using a total laser station, differential GPS and 27 interconnected benchmarks to assess variation in DEM accuracy. Interpolation using Inverse Distance Weighting IDW resulted in lower mean error than other methods. Across the study area, overall signed error and RMSE were +0.02 m and 0.59 m, respectively. Signed errors indicated elevations were over-estimated in forest but under-estimated within meadow habitats. Increasing slope gradient increased vertical absolute errors and RMSE. In contrast, lidar sampling angle had little impact on measured error. These results have implications for the development and use of high-resolution DEM models derived from lidar data.

            Urban Surface Biophysical Descriptors and Land Surface Temperature Variations

                In remote sensing studies of land surface temperatures (LST), thematic land-use and land-cover (LULC) data are frequently-employed for simple correlation analyses between LULC types and their thermal signatures. Development of quantitative surface descriptors could improve our capabilities for modeling urban thermal landscapes and advance urban climate research. This study developed an analytical procedure based upon a spectral unmixing model for characterizing and quantifying the urban landscape in Indianapolis, Indiana. A Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus image of the study area, acquired on 22 June 2002, was spectrally unmixed into four fraction endmembers, namely, green vegetation, soil, high and low albedo. Impervious surface was then computed from the high and low albedo images. A hybrid classification procedure was developed to classify the fraction images into seven land-use and land-cover classes. Next, pixel-based LST measurements were related to urban surface biophysical descriptors derived from spectral mixture analysis (SMA). Correlation analyses were conducted to investigate land-cover based relationships between LST and impervious surface and green vegetation fractions for an analysis of the causes of LST variations. Results indicate that fraction images derived from SMA were effective for quantifying the urban morphology and for providing reliable measurements of biophysical variables such as vegetation abundance, soil, and impervious surface. An examination of LST variations within census block groups and their relationships with the compositions of LULC types, biophysical descriptors, and other relevant spatial data shows that LST possessed a weaker relation with the LULC compositions than with other variables (including urban biophysical descriptors, remote sensing biophysical variables, CIS-based impervious surface variables, and population density). Further research should be directed to refine spectral mixture modeling. The use of multi-temporal remote sensing data for urban time-space modeling and comparison of urban morphology in different geographical settings are also feasible.

                In forestry, the availability of high spatial resolution (<1 m/pixel) imagery from new earth observation satellites like Ikonos favours a shift in the image analysis paradigm from a pixel-based approach towards one dealing directly with the essential structuring element of such images: the individual tree crown (ITC). This paper gives an initial assessment of the effects of 1 m and 4 m/pixel spatial resolutions (panchromatic and multispectral bands, respectively) on the detection, delineation, and classification of the individual tree crowns seen in Ikonos images. Winter and summer Ikonos images of the Hudson plantation of the Petawawa Research Forest, Ontario, Canada were analyzed. The panchromatic images were resampled to 0.5 m/pixel and then smoothed using a 3 × 3 kernel mean filter. A valley-following algorithm and rule-based isolation module were applied to delineate the individual tree crowns. Local maxima within a moving 3 × 3 window (i.e., Tree Tops) were also extracted from the smoothed images for comparison. Crown delineation and detection results were summarised and compared with field tree counts. Overall, the ITC delineation and the local maxima approaches led to tree counts that were on average 15 percent off for both seasons. Visual inspection reveals delineation of clusters of two or three crowns as a common source of error. Crown-based species spectral signatures were generated for six classes representing conifer species, plus a hardwood class and a shrub class. After the ITC-based classification, classification accuracy was ascertained using separate test areas of known species. The overall accuracy was 59 percent. Important confusion exists between red and white spruces, and mature versus immature white pines, but post-classification regroupings into single spruce and white pine classes led to an overall accuracy of 67 percent.
