                Pulse density, the number of laser pulses that intercept a surface per unit area, is a key consideration when acquiring an Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) dataset. This study compares area-based vegetation structure metrics derived from multi-return ALS simulated at six pulse densities (0.05 to 4 pl m-2) across a range of forest types: from savannah woodlands to dense rainforests. Results suggest that accurate measurement of structure metrics (canopy height, canopy cover, and vertical canopy structure) can be achieved with a pulse density of 0.5 pl m-2across all forest types when compared to a dataset of 10 pl m-2. For pulse densities <0.5 pl m-2, two main sources of error lead to inaccuracies in estimation: the poor identification of the ground surface and sparse vegetation cover leading to under sampling of the canopy profile. This analysis provides useful information for land managers determining capture specifications for large-area ALS acquisitions.

                Unsupervised change detection techniques have been widely employed in the remote-sensing area when suitable reference data is not available. Image (or Index) differencing is one of the most commonly used methods due to its simplicity. However, past applications of image differencing were often inefficient in separating real change and noise due to the lack of steps for feature selection and integration of contextual information. To address these issues, we propose a novel unsupervised procedure which uses two complementary features, namely luminance and saturation, extracted from multispectral images, and combines T-point thresholding, Bayes fusion, and Markov Random Fields. Through a case study, the performance of our proposed procedure was compared with other three unsupervised change-detection methods including Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Fuzzy c-means (FCM), and Expectation Maximum-Markov Random Field (EM-MRF). The change detection results from our proposed method are more compact with less noise than those from other methods over urban areas. The quantitative accuracy assessment indicates that the overall accuracy and Kappa statistic of our proposed procedure are 95.1 percent and 83.3 percent, respectively, which are significantly higher than the other three unsupervised change detection methods.

            Valuing Geospatial Information: Using the Contingent Valuation Method to Estimate the Economic Benefits of Landsat Satellite Imagery

                While the U.S. government does not charge for downloading Landsat images, the images have value to users. This paper demonstrates a method that can value Landsat and other imagery to users. A survey of downloaders of Landsat images found: (a) established US users have a mean value of $912 USD per scene; (b) new US users and users returning when imagery became free have a mean value of $367 USD per scene. Total US user benefits for the 2.38 million scenes downloaded is $1.8 billion USD. While these benefits indicate a high willingness-to-pay among many Landsat downloaders, it would be economically inefficient for the US government to charge for Landsat imagery. Charging a price of $100 USD a scene would result in an efficiency loss of $37.5 million a year. This economic information should be useful to policy-makers who must decide about the future of this and similar remote sensing programs.

            Using International Standards to Control the Positional Quality of Spatial Data

                A positional quality control method based on the application of the International Standard ISO 2859 is proposed. This entails a common framework for dealing with the control of all other spatial data quality components (e.g., completeness, consistency, etc.). We propose a relationship between the parameters “acceptable quality level” and “limiting quality” of the international standard and positional quality by means of observed error models. This proposal does not require any assumption for positional errors (e.g., normality), which means that the application is universal. It can be applied to any type of positional and geometric controls (points, line-strings), to any dimension (1D, 2D, 3D, etc.) and with parametric or non-parametric error models (e.g., lidar). This paper introduces ISO 2859, presents the statistical bases of the proposal and develops two examples of application, the first dealing with a lot-by-lot control and the second, isolated lot control.

                The present study is aimed at developing a methodology to extract maize, a predominant energy crop, and efficiently map its spatial distribution in a Natura 2000 region of northern Germany. Following a GEOBIA approach, segmentation was performed on two hierarchical levels. Level 1 consisted of field boundaries, and level 2 represented variations within level 1. Decision rules were developed for level 2 based on spectral information, vegetation indices, standard deviations and knowledge of crop phenology. For this purpose, first, level 2 image objects were classified. Subsequently classification was shifted to level 1. Maize covered 10.6 percent of total study area. The presented methodology gives the advanced user the flexibility to integrate expert knowledge in the classifier. In addition, the implementation time of decision rules was very fast and helped to produce results with high accuracy.
