                There are three strategies by which the accuracy of classification can be improved after the imagery that will be used for the classification has been chosen. These are to improve the definition of the class decision surfaces, to maximize the between class distances, and to reduce the within class variances. This paper reports on work done to investigate the relationship between classification accuracy and within class variances, where generally accepted measures of accuracy derived from the Confusion Matrix are used as the indicators of classification accuracy. This paper shows that the within class variances are a function of image resolution, and it provides a mechanism based on the Average Local Variance (ALV) function to find the resolution that will yield the highest relative within field classification accuracy by minimizing the within class variances

                In recent years, object-oriented image analysis has been widely adopted by the remote sensing community. Much attention has been given to its application, while the fundamental issue of scale, here characterized by spatial object-definition, seems largely neglected.In the case of vegetation parameters like aboveground biomass and leaf area index (LAI), fundamental objects are individual trees or shrubs, each of which has a specific value. Their spatial extent, however, does not match pixels in size and shape, nor does it fit the requirements of regional studies. Estimation of vegetation parameters consequently demands larger observation units, like vegetation patches, which are better represented by variably shaped objects than by square pixels.This study aims to investigate optimal object definition for biomass and LAI. We have data from 243 field plots in our test site in southern France. They cover a vegetation range fromlandestogarriguetomaquis, which is considered to be the climax vegetation in the area. A HyMap image covers the area.The image is subjected to a Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) transformation, after which it is segmented with ten different heterogeneities. The result is ten object sets, each having a different mean object size. These object sets are combined with the original image with the mean band values serving as object attributes.Field observations are linked to the corresponding objects for each object set. Using Ridge regression, relations between field observations and spectral values are identified. The prediction error is determined for each object set by cross validation. The overall lowest prediction error indicates the optimal heterogeneity for segmentation.Results show that the scale of prediction affects prediction accuracy, that increasing the object size yields an optimum in prediction accuracy, and that aboveground biomass and LAI can be associated with different optimal object sizes. Furthermore, it is shown that the accuracy of parameter estimation is higher for object-oriented analysis than for per-pixel analysis.

                Super-resolution or sub-pixel class mapping is the task of providing fine spatial resolution maps of, for example, land-cover classes, from satellite sensor measurements obtained at a coarser spatial resolution. Often, the only information available consists of coarse class fraction data, typically obtained through spectral unmixing. This paper shows how to integrate, in addition to such coarse fractions, class labels at a set of fine pixels obtained independent of the satellite sensor measurements. The integration of such fine spatial resolution information is achieved within the Indicator Kriging formalism in either a prediction or simulation mode. The spatial dissimilarity or texture of class labels at the fine (target) resolution is quantified in a non-parametric way from an analog scene using a set of experimental indicator semivariogram maps. The output of the proposed procedure consists of maps of probabilities of class occurrence, or of a series of simulated class maps characterizing the inherent spatial uncertainty in the super-resolution mapping process.

            Variability in Soft Classification Prediction and its implications for Sub-pixel Scale Change Detection and Super Resolution Mapping

                The impact of intra-class spectral variability on the estimation of sub-pixel land-cover class composition with a linear mixture model is explored. It is shown that the nature of intra-class variation present has a marked impact on the accuracy of sub-pixel class composition estimation, as it violates the assumption that a class can be represented by a single spectral endmember. It is suggested that a distribution of possible class compositions can be derived from pixels instead of a single class composition prediction. This distribution provides a richer indication of possible sub-pixel class compositions and highlights a limitation for super-resolution mapping. Moreover, the class composition distribution information may be used to derive different scenarios of changes when used in a post-classification comparison type approach to change detection. This latter issue is illustrated with an example of forest cover change in Brazil from Landsat TM data.

            Assessing Alternatives for Modeling the Spatial Distribution of Multiple Land-cover Classes at Sub-pixel Scales

                We introduce and evaluate three methods for modeling the spatial distribution of multiple land-cover classes at sub-pixel scales: (a) sequential categorical swapping, (b) simultaneous categorical swapping, and (c) simulated annealing. Method 1, a modification of a binary pixel-swapping algorithm, allocates each class in turn to maximize internal spatial autocorrelation. Method 2 simultaneously examines all pairs of cell-class combinations within a pixel to determine the most appropriate pairs of sub-pixels to swap. Method 3 employs simulated annealing to swap cells. While convergence is relatively slow, Method 3 offers increased flexibility. Each method is applied to a classified Landsat-7 ETM dataset that has been resampled to a spatial resolution of 210 m, and evaluated for accuracy performance and computational efficiency.

            Scaling Field Data to Calibrate and Validate Moderate Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Models

                Validation and calibration are essential components of nearly all remote sensing-based studies. In both cases, ground measurements are collected and then related to the remote sensing observations or model results. In many situations, and particularly in studies that use moderate resolution remote sensing, a mismatch exists between the sensor’s field of view and the scale at which in situ measurements are collected. The use of in situ measurements for model calibration and validation, therefore, requires a robust and defensible method to spatially aggregate ground measurements to the scale at which the remotely sensed data are acquired. This paper examines this challenge and specifically considers two different approaches for aggregating field measurements to match the spatial resolution of moderate spatial resolution remote sensing data: (a) landscape stratification; and (b) averaging of fine spatial resolution maps. The results show that an empirically estimated stratification based on a regression tree method provides a statistically defensible and operational basis for performing this type of procedure.

            Land-use/Land-cover Classification with Multispectral and Hyperspectral EO-1 Data

                We compared the capability of the Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) Hyperion hyperspectral (HS) data with that of the EO-1 Advanced Land Imager (ALI) multispectral (MS) data for discriminating different land-use and land-cover classes in Fremont, California. We designed a classification scheme of two levels with level I including general classes and level II including more specific classes. Classification shows that the HS data does not produce better results than the MS data when we directly applied a Mahalanobis distance (MD) classifier.We tested a number of feature reduction and extraction algorithms for the HS image. These algorithms include principal component analysis (PCA), segmented PCA (SEGPCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), segmented LDA (SEGLDA), penalized discriminant analysis (PDA) and segmented PDA (SEGPDA). Feature reductions were all followed by an MD classifier for image classification. With SEGPDA, SEGLDA, PDA, and LDA, similar accuracies were achieved while a segmentation-based approach we proposed (SEGPDA or SEGLDA) greatly improved computation efficiency. They all outperformed SEGPCA and PCA by 4 to 5 percent (level II) and 1 to 3 percent (level I) in classification accuracy.For level II classification, overall accuracies obtained by using the features extracted from the HS image were 2 to 3 percent greater than those obtained with the MS image. For various vegetation class and impervious land use categories, the HS data consistently produced better results than the MS data. For level I classification, the HS image generated a thematic map that is <0.01 greater in kappa coefficient comparing to the MS image. When we collapsed the level II classification map to a level I map, 5 percent (HS) to 7 percent (MS) improvements were achieved.

The output of the proposed procedure consists of maps of probabilities of class occurrence, or of a series of simulated class maps characterizing the inherent spatial uncertainty in the super-resolution mapping process.

                The impact of intra-class spectral variability on the estimation of sub-pixel land-cover class composition with a linear mixture model is explored. It is shown that the nature of intra-class variation present has a marked impact on the accuracy of sub-pixel class composition estimation, as it violates the assumption that a class can be represented by a single spectral endmember. It is suggested that a distribution of possible class compositions can be derived from pixels instead of a single class composition prediction. This distribution provides a richer indication of possible sub-pixel class compositions and highlights a limitation for super-resolution mapping. Moreover, the class composition distribution information may be used to derive different scenarios of changes when used in a post-classification comparison type approach to change detection. This latter issue is illustrated with an example of forest cover change in Brazil from Landsat TM data.

                We introduce and evaluate three methods for modeling the spatial distribution of multiple land-cover classes at sub-pixel scales: (a) sequential categorical swapping, (b) simultaneous categorical swapping, and (c) simulated annealing. Method 1, a modification of a binary pixel-swapping algorithm, allocates each class in turn to maximize internal spatial autocorrelation. Method 2 simultaneously examines all pairs of cell-class combinations within a pixel to determine the most appropriate pairs of sub-pixels to swap. Method 3 employs simulated annealing to swap cells. While convergence is relatively slow, Method 3 offers increased flexibility. Each method is applied to a classified Landsat-7 ETM dataset that has been resampled to a spatial resolution of 210 m, and evaluated for accuracy performance and computational efficiency.

            Scaling Field Data to Calibrate and Validate Moderate Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Models

                Validation and calibration are essential components of nearly all remote sensing-based studies. In both cases, ground measurements are collected and then related to the remote sensing observations or model results. In many situations, and particularly in studies that use moderate resolution remote sensing, a mismatch exists between the sensor’s field of view and the scale at which in situ measurements are collected. The use of in situ measurements for model calibration and validation, therefore, requires a robust and defensible method to spatially aggregate ground measurements to the scale at which the remotely sensed data are acquired. This paper examines this challenge and specifically considers two different approaches for aggregating field measurements to match the spatial resolution of moderate spatial resolution remote sensing data: (a) landscape stratification; and (b) averaging of fine spatial resolution maps. The results show that an empirically estimated stratification based on a regression tree method provides a statistically defensible and operational basis for performing this type of procedure.

            Land-use/Land-cover Classification with Multispectral and Hyperspectral EO-1 Data

                We compared the capability of the Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) Hyperion hyperspectral (HS) data with that of the EO-1 Advanced Land Imager (ALI) multispectral (MS) data for discriminating different land-use and land-cover classes in Fremont, California. We designed a classification scheme of two levels with level I including general classes and level II including more specific classes. Classification shows that the HS data does not produce better results than the MS data when we directly applied a Mahalanobis distance (MD) classifier.We tested a number of feature reduction and extraction algorithms for the HS image. These algorithms include principal component analysis (PCA), segmented PCA (SEGPCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), segmented LDA (SEGLDA), penalized discriminant analysis (PDA) and segmented PDA (SEGPDA). Feature reductions were all followed by an MD classifier for image classification. With SEGPDA, SEGLDA, PDA, and LDA, similar accuracies were achieved while a segmentation-based approach we proposed (SEGPDA or SEGLDA) greatly improved computation efficiency. They all outperformed SEGPCA and PCA by 4 to 5 percent (level II) and 1 to 3 percent (level I) in classification accuracy.For level II classification, overall accuracies obtained by using the features extracted from the HS image were 2 to 3 percent greater than those obtained with the MS image. For various vegetation class and impervious land use categories, the HS data consistently produced better results than the MS data. For level I classification, the HS image generated a thematic map that is <0.01 greater in kappa coefficient comparing to the MS image. When we collapsed the level II classification map to a level I map, 5 percent (HS) to 7 percent (MS) improvements were achieved.
