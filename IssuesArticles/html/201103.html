                Accurate forest structural parameters are crucial to forest inventory, and modeling of the carbon cycle and wildlife habitat. Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) is particularly suitable to the measurement of forest structural parameters. In this paper, we describe a pilot study to extract forest structural parameters, such as tree height, diameter at breast height (DBH), and position of individual tree using a terrestrial lidar (LMS-Z360i; Riegel, Inc.). The lidar was operated to acquire both vertical and horizontal scanning in the field in order to obtain a point cloud of the whole scene. An Iterative Closet Point (ICP) algorithm was introduced to obtain the transformation matrix of each range image and to mosaic multiple range images together. Based on the mosaiced data set, a variable scale and threshold filtering method was used to separate ground from the vegetation. Meanwhile, a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and a Canopy Height Model (CHM) were generated from the classified point cloud. A stem detection algorithm was used to extract the location of individual trees. A slice above 1.3 m from the ground was extracted and rasterized. A circle fitting algorithm combined with the Hough transform was used to retrieve the DBH based on the rasterized grid. Tree heights were calculated using the height difference between the minimum and maximum Z values within the position of each individual tree with a 1 m buffer. All of the 26 trees were detected correctly, tree height and DBH were determined with a precision of 0.76 m and 3.4 cm, respectively, comparing with those visually measured in the lidar data. Our methods and results confirm that terrestrial lidar can provide nondestructive, high-resolution, and automatic determination of parameters required in forest inventory.

                Modeling the3Dcanopy structure of trees provides the structural mapping capability on which to assign distributed values of light-driven physiological processes in tree canopies. We evaluate the potential of automatically extracted skeletons from terrestrial lidar data as a basis for modeling canopy structure. The automatic and species independent evaluation method for lidar data of trees is based on the SKELTRE algorithm. The SKELTRE skeleton is a graphical representation of the branch hierarchy. The extraction of the branch hierarchy utilizes a graph splitting procedure to extract the branches from the skeleton. Analyzing the distance between the point cloud points and the skeleton is the key to the branch diameter. Frequency distributions of branch length and diameter were chosen to test the algorithm performance in comparison to manually measured data and resulted in a correlation of up to 0.78 for the branch length and up to 0.99 for the branch diameter.

                This paper introduces a multi-level morphological active contour (MMAC) algorithm to identify and delineate tree crowns in mountainous forest based on rasterized airborne lidar data. MMAC is a generalized tree crown mapping algorithm which can accommodate multiple heads in a crown as well as overlapping crowns. The MMAC algorithm comprises three steps: bottom up erosion (BUE) which identifies stand candidates, top down dilation (TDD) which estimates the crown periphery, and an active contour model (ACM) which delineates crown contours. Three sample plots were selected in Alishan National Scenic Area, Taiwan, (predominantly alder, sugi, and red cypress) for evaluation of the algorithm. When compared with ground survey data, the algorithm achieved an average detection accuracy of 24 percent omission error and 13 percent commission error in identifying individual trees in mountainous forest stands. Detection accuracy is potentially related to stand density.

                A novel approach for improving the consistency of intensity measurements using range-based normalization is introduced. The normalization is data-driven, can be fully automated, and involves scaling differences in observed intensity between returns collocated in space but registered to different laser scanning swaths. The scaling is proportional to the overall rate of attenuation f of laser energy. The utility of this approach for applications of lidar over forests was evaluated by examining classification results of broad cover types obtained using observed and normalized intensity measurements in an Oregon study area. The normalization was more effective for single returns, leading to a 53 percent reduction in intensity coefficient of variation between observed and range-normalized measurements. The poor cover type classification accuracy (44.4 percent; kappa 0.167) obtained by using observed intensities of first returns improved substantially to 75.6 percent (kappa 0.624) when using above-ground, single returns and f = 2.04.

                This study investigates the potential of discrete return light detection and ranging (lidar) data to characterize forest succession in a mixed mature forest in central Ontario using indices applied to the lidar point cloud. Derived indices include statistical indices, predicted Lorey’s height (R2=0.86; RSME=2.36 m) and quadratic mean diameter-at-breast-height (R2=0.68; RMSE=1.21 cm), canopy density indices and an information theory based complexity index. To assess how well these indices are able to capture the vertical structure of forest stands, they are compared to Oliver and Larson’s (1996) four stages of forest stand development. Best subsets regressions indicated that no single index is able to separate all four stages adequately. However, the predicted Lorey’s height index is optimal for separating early from mid succession stages (p<.0001) and a combination of height and complexity indices performed best to discriminate between mid- and late-succession stages (p<.0001).

                This paper presents a method to estimate forest parameters and surface topography from NASA’s Geosciences Laser Altimeter System (GLAS). Their potential use as observational inputs to models is demonstrated using a wind-risk model for the UK, ForestGALES. Relative heights above ground were used as biophysical parameter estimators. Top Height was estimated with R2=0.73, RMSE=4.5 m. Diameter at breast height estimates differed for conifer-dominated stands (R2=0.72, RMSE=0.07 m) and for stands containing mostly broadleaves (R2=0.41, RMSE=0.11 m). Ground elevation estimation produced R2=0.997, RMSE=2.2 m. These three parameters were applied to ForestGALES for stand-level assessment of wind-throw risk. Stability is sensitive to small differences in tree dimensions, and therefore vegetation parameters require greater accuracy than those currently retrievable from GLAS to more reliably determine risk of wind-throw. Future satellite lidar missions such as NASA’s DESDynI sensor aim to produce improved vegetation parameter estimation plus greater spatial coverage which would offer more appropriate inputs for forestry models.

                This study developed a new method to derive forest type information from large-footprint lidar data based on full waveform analysis. For this purpose, the raw waveform was decomposed into Gaussian components, and canopy return and ground return of the waveforms were separated. Two types of metrics hypothesized to have relationship with forest types were derived from the canopy return part of the waveform. The first type of metrics is quantile-based metrics reflecting the vertical distribution of canopy return energy, and the second type is statistical characteristics of the Gaussian components of canopy return part. Support Vector Machine classification was applied to different combinations of the metrics to find their relationship with different forest types. The results showed that the second type of metrics, indicating the canopy stratum characteristics, showed great promise in separating broad-leaved and needle-leaved forests with the accuracy ranging from 88.68 percent to 90.57 percent and Kappa statistic from 0.7406 to 0.7868.
