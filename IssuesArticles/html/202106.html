                Multispectral satellite imagery is the primary data source for monitoring land cover change and characterizing land cover globally. However, the consistency of land cover monitoring is limited by the spatial and temporal resolutions of the acquired satellite images. The public availability of daily high-resolution images is still scarce. This paper aims to fill this gap by proposing a novel spatiotemporal fusion method to enhance daily low spatial resolution land cover mapping using a weakly supervised deep convolutional neural network. We merge Sentinel images and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS )-derived thematic land cover maps under the application background of massive remote sensing data and the large spatial resolution gaps between MODIS data and Sentinel images. The neural network training was conducted on the public data set SEN12MS, while the validation and testing used ground truth data from the 2020 IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society data fusion contest. The proposed data fusion method shows that the synthesized land cover map has significantly higher spatial resolution than the corresponding MODIS-derived land cover map. The ensemble approach can be implemented for generating high-resolution time series of satellite images by fusing fine images from Sentinel-1 and -2 and daily coarse images from MODIS.

                The influences of ecological protection redlines on urban sustainable development can significantly vary from place to place with distinct ecological functions and human activity interference. However, recent research lacks the evaluation of ecological functions and human activity interference in ecological protection redline areas near urban areas. This article presents an evaluation method consisting of two evaluation criteria systems: an ecological function evaluation criteria system based on conserving water resources and soil and maintaining biodiversity and a human activity interfer- ence evaluation criteria system based on the human activity impact index, population and road network density, and the intensity of tourism activity and livelihood sewage discharge. This evaluation method was verified in Zoige County, China, by using remote sensing data to evaluate ecological functions and human activity interference in the ecological redline area for an urban environment. This evaluation method is one of the preliminary studies of urban sustainable develop- ment planning, and the result could provide a basis for the formulation of urban sustainable development strategy.

                Digital elevation model (DEM) filtering is critical in DEM production, and large-area meter-level resolution DEM is mainly generated from high-resolution satellite images. However, the current DEM filtering methods are mostly aimed at laser scanning data and tend to excessively remove ground points when processing a satellite digital surface model (DSM). To accurately filter out buildings and preserve terrain, we propose a DEM filtering algorithm using building segmentation results of orthophoto. Based on morphological filtering, our method estimates the probability of being a built-up area or mountains for DSM, and according to this probability the filtering parameters are adaptively adjusted. For robustness, our method performs the above filtering operation on DSM through a sliding-window approach, and finally the nonground points are determined by the votes of multiple filtering. Experiments against six representative data sets have shown that our method achieved superior perfor- mance than classical algorithms and commercial software.

            A Combined Unmixing Framework for Impervious Surface Mapping on Medium-Resolution Images with Visible Shadows

                Spectral unmixing methods with medium-resolution remote sensing images have become the main approach to mapping urban impervious-surface information. However, as more tall buildings appear, numerous visible shadows exist in medium-resolution images; these have usually been ignored in previous research, but they seriously affect accuracy. To solve this problem, we propose a combined unmixing framework to extract impervious surface in nonshadow and shadow areas, using linear and nonlinear unmixing models, respectively. First shadow is separated from nonshadow. Then a nonlinear unmixing method is selected to map impervious surface in shadow, which is more suitable to the complex imaging environment in shadow, and a classic linear unmixing model in nonshadow. Through experimental tests, the proposed combined unmixing framework is shown to effectively reduce error in two study areas compared with classical unmixing methods.

                Many manifold learning algorithms conduct an eigen vector analysis on a data-similarity matrix with a size of N×N, where N is the number of data points. Thus, the memory complexity of the analysis is no less than O(N2). We pres- ent in this article an incremental manifold learning approach to handle large hyperspectral data sets for land use identification. In our method, the number of dimensions for the high-dimensional hyperspectral-image data set is obtained with the training data set. A local curvature varia- tion algorithm is utilized to sample a subset of data points as landmarks. Then a manifold skeleton is identified based on the landmarks. Our method is validated on three AVIRIS hyperspectral data sets, outperforming the comparison algorithms with a k–nearest-neighbor classifier and achieving the second best performance with support vector machine.
