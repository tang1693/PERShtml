                Some requirements which an ideal geographic information system (GIS) must meet to cope with the challenges of the future are described. We look at data modeling, the integration of geographic information science and photogrammetry, update and refinement of a geospatial database, and data integration. We claim that data modeling needs to be carried out in3D based on a topologic data structure with the possibility for incorporating change. Photogrammetric operations such as the generation of digital terrain models or the manual and automatic acquisition of vector data from imagery should be considered as modules of future GIS, which should also have efficient mechanisms for incremental updating and versioning. Finally, the integration of all types of data should be possible, e.g., various vector data sets as well as DTMs and images.We illustrate the requirements with the help of three examples, one describing data acquisition and modeling in an interdisciplinary project, one dealing with quality control and update using imagery, and the last one presenting an algorithm for the integration of a2D data set and a DTM.This paper discusses GIS from a photogrammetric point of view with an emphasis on imaging and data acquisition. While we believe that the discussed requirements are vital for the development of GIS, we are aware of the fact that other issues such as database design, software architecture, visualization, geospatial data infrastructure, and web mapping, only briefly mentioned or not discussed at all in this paper, are of similar importance for the field.

                Technological advances in positioning and imaging sensors, combined with the explosion in wireless mobile communication systems that occurred during the last decade of the twentieth century, practically redefined and substantially extended the concept of mobile mapping. The advent of the first mobile mapping systems (MMS) in the early 1990s initiated the process of establishing modern, virtually ground-control-free photogrammetry and digital mapping. By the end of the last decade, mobile mapping technology had made remarkable progress, evolving from rather simple land-based systems to more sophisticated, real-time multitasking and multisensor systems, operational in land and airborne environments. New specialized systems, based on modern imaging sensors, such as CCD (charge-coupled device) cameras, lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) and hyperspectral/multispectral scanners, are being developed, aimed at automatic data acquisition for geoinformatics, thematic mapping, land classification, terrain modeling, emergency response, homeland security, etc. This paper provides an overview of the mobile mapping concept, with a special emphasis on the MMS paradigm shift from the post-mission to near-real-time systems that occurred in the past few years. A short review of the direct georeferencing concept is given, and the major techniques (sensors) used for platform georegistration, as well as the primary radiolocation techniques based on wireless networks, are presented. An overview of the major imaging sensors and the importance of multisensor system calibration are also provided. Future perspectives of mobile mapping and its extension towards telegeoinformatics are also discussed. Some examples of mobile geospatial technology used in automatic object recognition, real-time highway centerline mapping, thematic mapping, and city modeling with lidar and multispectral imagery are included.

                A classification technique which distinguishes between man-made and natural textural features visible on high resolution satellite images is introduced. The proposed work aims to evaluate non-linear classification techniques by the unification of appropriate texture analysis methods and a learning Bayesian classifier which is more robust against data uncertainty than the other types of linear classifiers. The classification technique introduced within this work will also provide an opportunity for fully automated thematic and land-use map generation.

                A rule-based expert system has been the most common artifi-cial intelligence (AI) technique for system integration with geographic information systems (GIS) because of its simple rule structure. In this paper, a rule-based expert system is presented that uses an interactive question-and-answer sequence integrated with GIS for spatial data mapping. The integrated system consists of three main parts: expert, user, and map. Rules can be constructed easily in the expert part using English. Users can derive a solution to a specific problem from the rules in the user part through the interactive question-and-answer sequence. The solution can then be mapped directly in the GIS (map) part. This system is applied to the interactive interpretation and mapping of aerial photographs for an urban area. The land-use/land-cover map results in 93.44 percent overall accuracy with a kappa index of 0.9288.

                Development control in urban planning is a collaborative decision-making process where a group of urban planners and land management staffs review or process the building application(s) submitted by a public agency and private citizen according to predefined regulations and workflow. This paper presents an event-driven approach for designing and developing a GIS-based Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) system for urban development control. This approach attempts to model both the structural and behavioral aspects of the development control process by integrated representation of agents, events, and states as well as their relations. These relations can be represented with UML (Unified Modeling Language), causal entity-relation diagram, and Event Pattern Language-based formal specifications.The integration of heterogeneous spatial and non-spatial data within such a GIS-based CSCW system for development control is also introduced in this paper. A method to link spatial objects and attributes in the multiscale, multitype dataset is proposed. Moreover, three kinds of specific functions are developed for handling routine works of development control, such as office automation functions, desktop spatial data handling and mapping tools, and generic queries.

                The functional layout, the operational features, and the characteristic results of the information fusion method ICAROS NET are presented. This is an innovative technique for the assessment of air quality and the related potential health effects at urban and regional scales. It is based on the multilayer fusion of environmental and epidemiological data and models aiming at reducing the error inherent in environmental measurements and their statistical interpretation. ICAROS NET exploits to the fullest the information potential of Earth observation data, atmospheric chemical and transport models, and ground-based measurements. The assimilation of information from all three data sources into an optimized computational model allows the estimation of tropospheric particulate loading at very high precision and very high spatial resolution.
