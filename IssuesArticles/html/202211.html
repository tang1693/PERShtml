                Nowadays, the type of vehicles, either tracked or wheeled in the Army has increased considerably and every decision maker wants the current details of off-road trafficability for operation planning. Therefore, vehicle-specific trafficability maps are the need of the hour. Emphasis should be given on soils capable of bearing the moving load of a vehicle and it is an important factor to be considered. Soil variability in spatial and temporal dimensions affects the assessment of off-road trafficability. Genetically, it is assumed that similar soil types behave similarly at a regional scale to reduce the complexity due to its variability. Remolding Cone Index (RCI) of Soil is the indicator of its capability and for generic solution; its value can be related to gravimetric moisture of soil for getting a general idea. In this paper, a logics-based, new concept has been introduced to rationalize the RCI values of these moist areas. Most significantly, moisture- and water-bound areas play an important role in the assessment of off-road trafficability. Therefore, to cover larger areas, a grid-based approach was taken as a base and, to get a preliminary idea of prevailing moisture, Normalized Difference Water Index was also mapped. Every vehicle has fixed vehicle cone index based on its vehicular characteristics and can be related with RCI for trafficability purpose. This new technique will save time and field work and is immensely useful for the trafficability assessment of any specific vehicle.

                It was difficult to accurately obtain crop planting structure by using the spectral information of high spatial resolution and low spatial resolution multispectral images of panchromatic images at the same time. In this paper, we propose a method of planting structure extraction based on indices and an improved U-Net semantic segmentation network. Based on the original band of Landsat-8, we used an image fusion algorithm to highlight the characteristics of vegetation, water, and soil respectively by three indices added, and the improved U-Net network was used to classify the type of planting structure. The results showed that the overall accuracy of classification was more than 91.6%, and the accuracy of crops was up to 93.8%. Automated water extraction index in image fusion effectively improved the classification accuracy. This method could extract a variety of information about planting structures automatically and accurately. It provided theoretical support for adjusting and optimizing regional planting structures.

            Managing Earth Hazards Using the Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for the Industrial Internet of Things Network

                Wireless networks using resource management with the enormous number of Internet of Things (IoT) users is a critical problem in developing networks for the fifth generation. The primary aim of this research is to optimize the use of IoT network resources. Earth surface features can be identified and their geo-biophysical properties estimated using radiation as the medium of interaction in remote sensing techniques (RST). Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has significantly improved traditional resource management, which is challenging to model. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) network has to be carried out in real time with excess network resources. Conventional techniques have a significant challenge because of the extensive range and complexity of wireless networks. The DRL method has been used in several areas, including management and allocation of resources, dynamic channel access, mobile downloading, unified edge computing, caching and communication, and fog radio access networks. DRL -IIoT is more successful than the Q-learning technique for a single agent. The design and analysis of the DRL -based approach in stationary base stations to solve the typical assignment of resources issues have been mostly restricted. The DRL is used as a clustering technique to construct the primary model of the system with k-means. This article discusses optical and microwave sensors in RST techniques and applications, examines the areas where there are gaps, and discusses Earth hazards. Furthermore, a comprehensive resource-based strengthening learning system is developed to ensure the best use of resources. Simulation results show that the suggested method efficiently (97.24%) allocates available spectrum, cache, and computer resources to deep deterministic policy gradient benchmarks.

                Using new remote sensing technology to study agricultural crops will support advances in food and water security. The recently launched, new generation spaceborne hyperspectral sensors, German DLR Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer (DESIS) and Italian PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA), provide unprecedented data in hundreds of narrow spectral bands for the study of the Earth. Therefore, our overarching goal in this study was to use these data to explore advances that can be made in agricultural research. We selected PRISMA and DESIS images during the 2020 growing season in California's Central Valley to study seven major crops. PRISMA and DESIS images were highly correlated (R 2of 0.9–0.95). Out of the 235 DESIS bands (400–1000 nm) and 238 PRISMA bands (400–2500 nm), 26 (11%) and 45 (19%) bands, respectively, were optimal to study agricultural crops. These optimal bands provided crop type classification accuracies of 83–90%. Hyperspectral vegetation indices to estimate plant pigment content, stress, biomass, moisture, and cellulose/lignin content were also identified.

                To extract buildings accurately, we propose a foreground-aware refinement network for building extraction. In particular, in order to reduce the false positive of buildings, we design the foreground-aware module using the attention gate block, which effectively suppresses the features of nonbuilding and enhances the sensitivity of the model to buildings. In addition, we introduce the reverse attention mechanism in the detail refinement module. Specifically, this module guides the network to learn to supplement the missing details of the buildings by erasing the currently predicted regions of buildings and achieves more accurate and complete building extraction. To further optimize the network, we design hybrid loss, which combines BCE loss and SSIM loss, to supervise network learning from both pixel and structure layers. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our network over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality.
