                The manual delineation of vegetation patches or forest stands is a costly and crucial stage in any land-cover mapping project or forest inventory based upon photointerpretation. Recent computer techniques have eased the task of the interpreter; however, a good deal of craftsmanship is still required in the delineation. In an effort to contribute to the automation of this process, we introduce Size-Constrained Region Merging (SCRM), a recently implemented software tool that provides the interpreter with an initial template of the tobe- mapped area that may reduce the manual digitization portion of the interpretation. In essence, SCRM transforms an ortho-rectified aerial or satellite image (single or multichannel) into a polygon vector layer that resembles the work of a human interpreter, whom with no a priori knowledge of the scene, was given the task of partitioning the image into a number of homogeneous polygons all exceeding a minimum size. We provide background information on SCRM foundations and workflow, and illustrate its application on three different types of satellite images.

                Traditional change detection approaches have been proven to be difficult in detecting vegetation changes in the moist tropical regions with multitemporal images. This paper explores the integration of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and SPOT High Resolution Geometric (HRG) instrument data for vegetation change detection in the Brazilian Amazon. A principal component analysis was used to integrate TM and HRG panchromatic data. Vegetation change/non-change was detected with the image differencing approach based on the TM and HRG fused image and the corresponding TM image. A rule-based approach was used to classify the TM and HRG multispectral images into thematic maps with three coarse land-cover classes: forest, non-forest vegetation, and non-vegetation lands. A hybrid approach combining image differencing and post-classification comparison was used to detect vegetation change trajectories. This research indicates promising vegetation change techniques, especially for vegetation gain and loss, even if very limited reference data are available.

                Edge effects have been a problem in image classification especially when scale-based textural methods were included in the classification process. This paper proposes a new approach to reducing edge effects. The essence of the new approach is that all pixels in a moving window make use of the textural information instead of only the center pixel as in the traditional moving window method. The performance of the new approach was tested in three classification scenarios. The results show that the new approach generally produced higher accuracy with larger window size and was much less affected by the edge issues than the traditional moving window method. The new approach yields satisfactory results as long as the window size is smaller than the land-use polygons and the class boundaries are not too complex.

                The advanced differential interferometric SAR techniques (A-DINSAR), based on time series of SAR images, are powerful geodetic tools for land deformation monitoring. This paper, which is focused on a particular A-DINSAR technique, named Stable Point Network, concisely outlines its characteristics and describes its products: average deformation maps, deformation time series, and the maps of the residual topographic error used to precisely geocode the A-DINSAR products. Furthermore, it illustrates the performance of the technique on a test area located in Barcelona, Spain. From this experiment, interesting features are highlighted: the capability to cover wide areas and at the same time measuring thin infrastructures, such as the main dike of the port; the good agreement between the deformation velocities and the reference values coming from leveling campaigns; the high sensitivity of the A-DINSAR estimations, which can measure millimeter-level periodical deformations due to thermal dilation, and the precise geocoding of the A-DINSAR products.

                Land surface temperature (LST) is a significant parameter in urban environmental analysis. Current research mainly focuses on the impact of land-use and land-cover (LULC) on LST. Seldom has research examined LST variations based on the integration of biophysical and demographic variables, especially for a rapidly developing city such as Beijing, China. This study combines the techniques of remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) to detect the spatial variation of LST and determine its quantitative relationship with several biophysical and demographic variables based on statistical modeling for the central area of Beijing. LST and LULC data were retrieved from a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image. Building heights were delimited from the shadows identified on a panchromatic SPOT image. The integration of LULC and census data was further applied to retrieve grid-based population density. Results indicate that the LST pattern was non-symmetrical and non-concentric with high temperature zones clustered towards the south of the central axis and within the fourth ring road. The percentage of forest, farmland, and water per grid cell were found to be most significant factors, which can explain 71.3 percent of LST variance. Principal component regression analysis shows that LST was positively correlated with the percentage of low density built-up, high density built-up, extremely-high buildings, low buildings per grid cell, and population density, but was negatively correlated with the percentage of forest, farmland, and water bodies per grid cell. The findings of this study can be applied as the theoretical basis for improving urban planning for mitigating the effects of urban heat islands.

                Commercial high spatial resolution satellite data now provide a synoptic and consistent source of digital imagery with detail comparable to that of aerial photography. In the work described here, per-pixel classification, image fusion, and GIS-based map refinement techniques were tailored to pan-sharpened 0.61 m QuickBird imagery to develop a six-category urban land-cover map with 89.3 percent overall accuracy (κ =0.87). The study area was a rapidly developing 71.5 km2part of suburban Raleigh, North Carolina, U.S.A., within the Neuse River basin. “Edge pixels” were a source of classification error as was spectral overlap between bare soil and impervious surfaces and among vegetated cover types. Shadows were not a significant source of classification error. These findings demonstrate that conventional spectral-based classification methods can be used to generate highly accurate maps of urban landscapes using high spatial resolution imagery.

                Urban development has expanded rapidly in Las Vegas, Nevada of the United States, over the last fifty years. A major environmental change associated with this urbanization trend is the transformation of the landscape from natural cover types to increasingly anthropogenic impervious surface. This research utilizes remote sensing data from both the Landsat and Terra-Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instruments in conjunction with digital orthophotography to estimate urban extent and its temporal changes by determining sub-pixel impervious surfaces. Percent impervious surface area has shown encouraging agreement with urban land extent and development density. Results indicate that total urban land-use increases approximately 110 percent from 1984 to 2002. Most of the increases are associated with medium-to high-density urban development. Places having significant increases in impervious surfaces are in the northwestern and southeastern parts of Las Vegas. Most high-density urban development, however, appears in central Las Vegas. Impervious surface conditions for 2002 measured from Landsat and ASTER satellite data are compared in terms of their accuracy.
