                Ongoing innovations in dense multi-view stereo image matching meanwhile allow for 3Ddata collection using image sequences captured from mobile mapping platforms even in complex and densely built-up areas. However, the extraction of dense and precise 3Dpoint clouds from such street-level imagery presumes high quality georeferencing as a first processing step. While standard direct georeferencing solves this task in open areas, poorGNSScoverage in densely built-up areas and urban canyons frequently prevents sufficient accuracy and reliability. Thus, we use bundle block adjustment, which additionally integrates tie and control point information for precise georeferencing of our multi-camera mobile mapping system. Subsequently, this allows the adaption of a state-of-the-art dense image matching pipeline to provide a suitable 3Drepresentation of the captured urban structures. In addition to the presentation of different processing steps, this paper also provides an evaluation of the achieved image-based 3Dcapture in a dense urban environment.

                Thanks to the development of mobile mapping technologies, close-range photogrammetry (CRP) has advanced to be an efficient mapping method for a variety of applications. A compactCRPsystem equipped with multiple cameras and aGPSreceiver is one of those advanced portable mapping systems. A portable panoramic image mapping system (PPIMS) was specially designed to capture panoramic images with eight cameras and to obtain the position of image station with aGPSreceiver. A PPIMS can be considered as a panoramicCRPsystem. The coordinates of an object point can be determined by the intersection of panoramic image points. For the implementation, we propose a new concept of photogrammetry by using panoramic images. Eight images captured byPPIMSforms a spherical panorama image (SPI). Instead of using the original images, PPIMSSPIsare then used for photogrammetric triangulation and mapping. Under this circumstance, oneSPIis formed for each station, and it is associated with only one set of exterior orientation (EO) parameters. Traditional collinearity equations are not applicable toSPItriangulation and mapping. Therefore, a novel bundle adjustment algorithm is proposed to solveEOof multi-stationSPIs. BecausePPIMSSPIsare not idealSPIs, a correction scheme was also developed to correct the imperfect geometry ofPPIMS SPI. Two test studies were performed for the data collected at a campus test field of National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) and at a historical site of Tainan. Both cases demonstrate the feasibility ofSPIbundle adjustment and applying corrections forPPIMSSPIsnecessary for effective for bundle adjustment. Furthermore, the experiment's results also confirm thatSPIscan replace original images forPPIMStriangulation.

            Rigorous Strip Adjustment of UAV-based Laserscanning Data Including Time-Dependent Correction of Trajectory Errors

                A new generation of laser scanners mounted on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have the potential to provide high-quality point clouds of comparatively small areas (a few hectares). The high maneuverability of theUAVs, a typically large field of view of the laser scanners, and a comparatively small measurement range lead to point clouds with very high point density, less occlusions, and low measurement noise. However, due to the limited payload ofUAVs, lightweight navigation sensors with a moderate level of accuracy are used to estimate the platform's trajectory. As a consequence, the georeferencing quality of the point clouds is usually sub-optimal; for this, strip adjustment can be performed. The main goal of strip adjustment is to simultaneously optimize the relative and absolute orientation of the strip-wise collected point clouds. This is done by fully re-calibrating the laser scanning system and by correcting systematic measurement errors of the trajectory. In this paper, we extend our previous work on the topic of strip adjustment by the estimation of time-dependent trajectory errors. The errors are thereby modelled by natural cubic splines with constant segment length in time domain. First results confirm the suitability of this flexible correction model by reducing the relative and absolute strip discrepancies to 1.38 cm and 1.65 cm, respectively.

                Derived point clouds from laser scanners and image-based dense-matching techniques usually include tremendous number of points. Processing (e.g., segmenting) such huge dataset is time-consuming and might not be necessary. For example, a planar surface just needs few points to be defined. In contrast, linear/cylindrical and rough features require more points for reliable modeling since during the data acquisition process, only a portion of linear/cylindrical features is present in the point cloud.This paper introduces an adaptive down-sampling strategy for removing redundant points from high density planar regions while retaining points in planar areas with sparse points and all the points within linear/cylindrical and rough neighborhoods. To demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed procedure, a comparison of segmentation results using original laser and image-based point clouds as well as the adaptively, uniformly, and point-spacing-based down-sampled point clouds are presented while commenting on the computational efficiency and the segmentation quality.

            Generating a Hazard Map of Dynamic Objects Using Lidar Mobile Mapping

                One of the hardest problems for future self-driving cars is to predict hazardous situations involving pedestrians and cyclists. Human drivers solve this problem typically by having a deeper understanding of the scene. The technical equivalent of this is to provide a hazard map, which serves as a prior for self-driving cars, enabling them to adjust driving speed and processing thresholds.In this paper, we present a method to derive such a hazard map using lidar mobile mapping. Pedestrians and cyclists are obtained from a sequence of point clouds by segmentation and classification. Their locations are then accumulated in a grid map, which serves as a "heat map" for possible hazardous situations. To demonstrate our approach, we generated a map using lidar mobile mapping, obtained by twelve measurement campaigns in Hanover (Germany). Our results show different outcomes for the city center, residential areas, busy roads, and road junctions.

                Full-waveform lidar data provides supplementary radiometric as well as more accurate geometric target information, when compared to discrete return systems. In this research, a wide range of classes in an urban scene; including trees, medium vegetation, low vegetation (grass), water bodies, pitched roofs, flat roofs, asphalt, vehicles, power lines, walls (fences) and concrete are considered. In order to tackle the challenge of distinguishing geometrically similar classes and enhancing the separability of other targets, a new set of features based on deconvolved waveforms is introduced. The positive effect of the proposed feature dataset on classification accuracy in individual classes is shown using two ensemble classifiers (random forests and RUSBoost). Performance of the classifiers is improved by integration with sampling techniques, especially for the under-represented classes. The final output of the proposed method is a highly detailed land cover map of the urban scene, which affords good separability between critical classes.
