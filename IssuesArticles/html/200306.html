                Interagency programs have made it possible for scientists from the USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS) to conduct remote sensing research with researchers from various federal, state, and private organizations since 1965. Cumulative results from these cooperative studies have established the scientific basis for using remotely acquired imagery to better understand and manage the Earth’s agricultural and natural resources. Examples of these partnerships include the 1965 Statement of Agreement between USDA and NASA that formally began ARS’s remote sensing research, the Large Area Crop Inventory Experiment (LACIE, 1974), the ARS Wheat Yield Project (1976), Agriculture and Resources Inventory Surveys Through Aerospace Remote Sensing (AgRISTARS, 1980), the China Wheat Project (1983), and AG 20/20 (1999). This paper provides a brief overview of these collaborations.

                Farm managers are becoming increasingly aware of the spatial variability in crop production with the growing availability of yield monitors. Often this variability can be related to differences in soil properties (e.g., texture, organic matter, salinity levels, and nutrient status) within the field. To develop management approaches to address this variability, high spatial resolution soil property maps are often needed. Some soil properties have been related directly to a soil spectral response, or inferred based on remotely sensed measurements of crop canopies, including soil texture, nitrogen level, organic matter content, and salinity status. While many studies have obtained promising results, several interfering factors can limit approaches solely based on spectral response, including tillage conditions and crop residue. A number of different ground-based sensors have been used to rapidly assess soil properties “on the go” (e.g., sensor mounted on a tractor and data mapped with coincident position information) and the data from these sensors compliment image-based data. On-the-go sensors have been developed to rapidly map soil organic matter content, electrical conductivity, nitrate content, and compaction. Model and statistical methods show promise to integrate these groundand image-based data sources to maximize the information from each source for soil property mapping.

                An overview of remote sensing research in hydrometeorology, with an emphasis on the major contributions that have been made by United States Department of Agriculture- Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) scientists, is provided. The major contributions are separated into deriving from remote sensing (1) hydrometeorological state variables and (2) energy fluxes, particularly evapotranspiration which includes plant water stress. For the state variables, remote sensing algorithms have been developed for estimating land surface temperatures from brightness temperature observations correcting for atmospheric and emissivity effects, estimating near-surface soil moisture from passive microwave remote sensing, determining snow cover from visible and snow water equivalent from microwave data, and estimating landscape roughness, topography, vegetation height, and fractional cover from lidar distancing technology. For the hydrometeorological fluxes, including plant water stress, models estimating evapotranspiration have been developed using land surface temperature as a key boundary condition with recent schemes designed to more reliably handle partial vegetation cover conditions. These research efforts in estimating evapotranspiration with remotely sensed surface temperatures have been utilized by ARS researchers in the development of the Crop Water Stress Index and Water Deficit Index for assessing plant water stress. In addition, the development of the Thermal Kinetic Window and Crop Specific Temperatures have revealed the dynamic interactions among foliage temperature, plant species, and the physical environment. ARS researchers continue to develop new and improved remote sensing algorithms for evaluating state variables and fluxes. Moreover, they are involved in new research directions to address science questions impeding hydrometeorological research. These include investigating the utility of combining multifrequency remote sensing data for improved estimation of land surface properties, and incorporating remote sensing for evaluating the effects of landscape heterogeneity on atmospheric dynamics and mean air properties and resulting feedbacks on the land surface fluxes.

                Scientists with the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and various government agencies and private institutions have provided a great deal of fundamental information relating spectral reflectance and thermal emittance properties of soils and crops to their agronomic and biophysical characteristics. This knowledge has facilitated the development and use of various remote sensing methods for non-destructive monitoring of plant growth and development and for the detection of many environmental stresses which limit plant productivity. Coupled with rapid advances in computing and positionlocating technologies, remote sensing from ground-, air-, and space-based platforms is now capable of providing detailed spatial and temporal information on plant response to their local environment that is needed for site specific agricultural management approaches. This manuscript, which emphasizes contributions by ARS researchers, reviews the biophysical basis of remote sensing; examines approaches that have been developed, refined, and tested for management of water, nutrients, and pests in agricultural crops; and assesses the role of remote sensing in yield prediction. It concludes with a discussion of challenges facing remote sensing in the future.

                Monitoring crop condition and production estimates at the state and county level is of great interest to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The National Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture conducts field interviews with sampled farm operators and obtains crop cuttings to make crop yield estimates at regional and state levels. NASS needs supplemental spatial data that provides timely information on crop condition and potential yields. In this research, the crop model EPIC (Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator) was adapted for simulations at regional scales. Satellite remotely sensed data provide a real-time assessment of the magnitude and variation of crop condition parameters, and this study investigates the use of these parameters as an input to a crop growth model. This investigation was conducted in the semi-arid region of North Dakota in the southeastern part of the state. The primary objective was to evaluate a method of integrating parameters retrieved from satellite imagery in a crop growth model to simulate spring wheat yields at the sub-county and county levels. The input parameters derived from remotely sensed data provided spatial integrity, as well as a real-time calibration of model simulated parameters during the season, to ensure that the modeled and observed conditions agree. A radiative transfer model, SAIL (Scattered by Arbitrary Inclined Leaves), provided the link between the satellite data and crop model. The model parameters were simulated in a geographic information system grid, which was the platform for aggregating yields at local and regional scales. A model calibration was performed to initialize the model parameters. This calibration was performed using Landsat data over three southeast counties in North Dakota. The model was then used to simulate crop yields for the state of North Dakota with inputs derived from NOAA AVHRR data. The calibration and the state level simulations are compared with spring wheat yields reported by NASS objective yield surveys.

                Rangelands are grasslands, shrublands, and savannas used by wildlife for habitat and livestock in order to produce food and fiber. Assessment and monitoring of rangelands are currently based on comparing the plant species present in relation to an expected successional end-state defined by the ecological site. In the future, assessment and monitoring may be based on indicators of ecosystem health, including sustainability of soil, sustainability of plant production, and presence of invasive weed species.USDAAgricultural Research Service(ARS)scientists are actively engaged in developing quantitative, repeatable, and low-cost methods to measure indicators of ecosystem health using remote sensing. Noxious weed infestations can be determined by careful selection of the spatial resolution, spectral bands, and timing of image acquisition. Rangeland productivity can be estimated with either Landsat or Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer data using models of gross primary production based on radiation use efficiency. Lidar measurements are useful for canopy structure and soil roughness, indicating susceptibility to erosion. The value of remote sensing for rangeland management depends in part on combining the imagery with other spatial data within geographic information systems. Finally, ARSscientists are developing the knowledge on which future range-land assessment and monitoring tools will be developed.

                Remote sensing techniques can be used to monitor water quality parameters (i.e., suspended sediments (turbidity), chlorophyll, and temperature). Optical and thermal sensors on boats, aircraft, and satellites provide both spatial and temporal information needed to monitor changes in water quality parameters for developing management practices to improve water quality. Recent and planned launches of satellites with improved spectral and spatial resolution sensors should lead to greater use of remote sensing techniques to assess and monitor water quality parameters. Integration of remotely sensed data, GPS, and GIS technologies provides a valuable tool for monitoring and assessing waterways. Remotely sensed data can be used to create a permanent geographically located database to provide a baseline for future comparisons. The integrated use of remotely sensed data, GPS, and GIS will enable consultants and natural resource managers to develop management plans for a variety of natural resource management applications.

                This review addresses the challenges and progress in sensor development and radiometric correction for agricultural applications with particular emphasis on activities within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS). Examples of sensor development include on-site development of sensors and platforms, participation in cooperative research and development agreements (CRADA) with commercial companies, and membership on NASA science teams. Examples of progress made in sensor radiometric correction suitable for agriculture are presented for both laboratory and field environments. The direction of future sensor development includes integrated sensors and systems, sensor standardization, and new sensor technologies measuring fluorescence and soil electrical conductivity, and utilizing LIght Detection and Ranging (lidar), hyperspectral, and multiband thermal wavelengths. The upcoming challenges include definition of the core spectral regions for agriculture and the sensor specifications for a dedicated, orbiting agricultural sensor, determination of an operational approach for reflectance and temperature retrieval, and enhanced communication between image providers, research scientists, and users. This review concludes with a number of avenues through which USDA could promote sensor development and radiometric correction for agricultural applications. These include developing a network of large permanent calibration targets at USDA ARS locations; investing in new technologies; pooling resources to support large-scale field experiments; determining ARS-wide standards for sensor development, calibration, and deployment; and funding interagency agreements to achieve common goals.
