                The transmitted laser mode of Geosciences Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) is a significant factor in determining the received pulse waveforms, which are used for inversing target information. The inversion algorithms in the scientific literature are based on the assumption that the transmitted laser is circular Gaussian. The practical laser pattern ofGLASis not circularly symmetric, but elliptical Gaussian. The received pulse shape will contain a bias, which would cause an error in the inversion information. In this paper, we describe new theoretical models about received pulse signal and inversion errors of range, surface slope and roughness. We present the results of waveforms shape and inversion errors for three representative terrains with different surface slope and roughness. The results show that the maximal inversion errors of range, surface slope, and roughness will reach 24.25 cm, 8.82Â° and 4.58 m, respectively, which cannot be negligible. Therefore, the inversion information should be reevaluated and amended depending on the type of terrain.

                Repeat station imaging (RSI) is an approach to precise aerial image registration and change detection. It involves planning and conducting aerial imaging flights such that the same sensor returns to the same imaging stations over time, replicating view geometry, and the resultant images are geometrically processed on a frame-by-frame basis. The objective of this paper is to elucidate and model the geometric elements associated with RSI capture and processing that influence the accuracy of co-registration. When each type of offset or difference in orientation is modeled separately, relative displacement of features in RSI pairs are linear functions of the varying orientation parameters and focal length, with the exception of an inverse square relationship with altitude above ground level; the combination of higher altitude and longer focal length reduces image displacements approximately in half. The average difference (bias) between modeled and measured parallax in ground dimensions is 0.1 m. Isolating the effects of orientation and offset factors is a useful first step towards developing a robust analytical model of the geometry of RSI pairs.

            Modeling the Effects of Horizontal Positional Error on Classification Accuracy Statistics

                Using a concept proposed by Stehman and Czaplewski (1997), we implemented spatially-explicit Monte Carlo simulations to test the effects of manually introduced horizontal positional error on standard inter-rater statistics derived from twelve classified high-resolution images. Through simulations we found that both overall and kappa accuracies decrease markedly with increasing error distance, varying greatly across distances relevant to practical application. The use of ground reference sites falling solely in homogeneous patches significantly improves inter-rater statistics and calls into question the use of kernel-smoothed data in one-time accuracy assessments. Our simulations offer insight into the scale of both structural and cover type heterogeneity across our landscapes, and support a new method for minimizing the effects of positional error on map accuracy. We recommend that analysts use caution when applying traditional accuracy assessment strategies to categorical maps, particularly when working with high-resolution imagery.

            Vegetation Effects Modeling in Soil Moisture Retrieval Using MSVI

                Brightness temperature (BT) measured by passive microwave sensors is usually affected by soil moisture, vegetation cover, and soil roughness. Soil moisture estimates have been limited to regions that had either bare soil or low to moderate amounts of vegetation cover.In this study, Simultaneous Land Parameters Retrieval Model (SLPRM) as an iterative least-squares minimization method has been used. This algorithm retrieves surface soil moisture, land surface temperature, and canopy temperature simultaneously using brightness temperature data in bare soil, low to moderate and higher amounts of vegetation cover.Furthermore, a new index calledMSVI(Multi Sensor Vegetation Index) has been introduced to approximate vegetation effects on properly observed brightness temperatures. The algorithm includes model construction, calibration, and validation using observations carried out for theSMEX03(Soil Moisture Experiment 2003) region in the South and North of Oklahoma. The results indicated about 0.9 percent improvement on soil moisture estimation accuracy using theMSVI.
