                The objectives of this research were to (a) develop a geo-object-based classification system for accurately mapping riparian land-cover classes for two QuickBird images, and (b) compare change maps derived from geo-object-based and per-pixel inputs used in three change detection techniques. The change detection techniques included post-classification comparison, image differencing, and the tasseled cap transformation. Two QuickBird images, atmospherically corrected to at-surface reflectance, were captured in May and August 2007 for a savanna woodlands area along Mimosa Creek in Central Queensland, Australia. Concurrent in-situ land-cover identification and lidar data were used for calibration and validation. The geo-object-based classification results showed that the use of class-related features and membership functions could be standardized for classifying the two QuickBird images. The geo-object-based inputs provided more accurate change detection results than those derived from the pixel-based inputs, as the geo-object-based approach reduced mis-registration and shadowing effects and allowed inclusion of context relationships.

                Vegetation mapping was performed using geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) and very high spatial resolution (VHR) imagery for two study areas in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. This study investigated how accurately GEOBIA with ancillary data emulates manual interpretation in rugged mountain areas for multi-level vegetation classes of the National Vegetation Classification System (NVCS). It was discovered that the incorporation of texture and topographic variables with spectral data from scanned color infrared aerial photographs increased the overall accuracy of GEOBIA vegetation classification by 2.8 percent and 5.0 percent Kappa. In a separate study using multispectral Ikonos imagery, the use of elevation, aspect, slope and proximity to streams produced NVCS macro-group vegetation segmentations that resembled manual interpretation and significantly improved the overall accuracy to 76.6 percent, Kappa 0.57. Ancillary information may thus aid in GEOBIA vegetation mapping for updating vegetation inventories in rugged mountain areas.

            Fuzzy Image Segmentation for Urban Land-Cover Classification

                A main problem of hard image segmentation is that, in complex landscapes, such as urban areas, it is very hard to produce meaningful crisp image-objects. This paper proposes a fuzzy approach for image segmentation aimed to produce fuzzy image-regions expressing degrees of membership of pixels to different target classes. This approach, called Fuzzy Image-Regions Method (FIRME), is a natural way to deal with the inherent ambiguity of remotely sensed images. The FIRME approach comprises three main stages: (a) image segmentation which creates fuzzy image-regions, (b) feature analysis which measures properties of fuzzy image regions, and (c) classification which produces the intended land-cover classes. The FIRME method was evaluated in a land-cover classification experiment using high spectral resolution imagery in an urban zone in Bogota, Colombia. Results suggest that in complex environments, fuzzy image segmentation may be a suitable alternative for GEOBIA as it produces higher thematic accuracy than the hard image segmentation and other traditional classifiers.

            Real World Objects in GEOBIA through the Exploitation of Existing Digital Cartography and Image Segmentation

                Descriptions of Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) often identify image segmentation as the initial step. This may be reasonable in some cases, but segmentation might also be considered a “black art,” due to its image dependence and the limited amount control available to users. The resulting segments reflect the spectral structure of the image rather than the physical structure of the landscape with no one-to-one relationship between real world objects and segments. Geographic analysis often begins in the context of existing mapping. In regions with high quality large scale cartography, an obvious question is why is this information not used in the GEOBIA process? It is therefore proposed that GEOBIA be redefined to use the best existing real world feature datasets as the starting point before segmentation is considered. Such an approach would increase opportunities for integration, improve map update initiatives, and widen uptake by end user communities.

                Keeping existing vector databases up to date is a real challenge for GIS data providers. This study directly compares a map with a more recent image in order to detect the discrepancies between them. An automatic workflow was designed to process the image based on existing information extracted from the vector database. First, geographic object-based image analysis provided automatically labeled image segments after matching the vector database to the image. Then, discrepancies were detected using a statistical iterative trimming, where outliers were excluded based on a likelihood threshold. Applied on forest map updating, the proposed workflow was able to detect about 75 percent of the forest regeneration, and 100 percent of the clear cuts with less than 10 percent of commission errors. This discrepancy detection approach assumes that discrepancy corresponds to small proportion of the map area and is very promising in diverse applications thanks to its flexibility.

                This paper describes an optimized implementation of an object-based cellular automata (CA) model recently developed to overcome the sensitivity of standard raster CA models to cell size and neighborhood configuration. In this CA model, space is partitioned using a vector structure in which the polygons correspond to meaningful geographical entities. The model allows the geometric transformation of each object based on the influence of its respective neighbors. In addition, it incorporates the concept of dynamic neighborhood where the neighborhood relationships among objects are expressed semantically, removing any restriction of distance in the neighborhood definition. The optimized implementation described in this paper makes use of a spatial database and spatial indexes to handle several spatial operations, which considerably reduces the computation time required for the simulations. The model is simple, flexible and robust, and can be easily adapted to various geographic areas at different scales.

                Remote sensing technology still faces challenges when it comes to monitoring tasks that must be able to stand up to validation from technical, scientific, and practical points of view, in other words, when entering into established, fully operational workflows. In this paper, we present an approach for delineating and monitoring aggregated spatial units relevant to regional planning tasks, which has been fully validated within a 3,654 km2area in the Stuttgart Region of southwestern Germany. This has been achieved by developing algorithms for semi-automated (geo-) object-based class modeling of biotope complexes, which are aggregated, functionally homogenous (but not necessarily spectrally homogenous) units. High levels of complexity in the target classes and the need for integration of auxiliary geodata as a priori knowledge meant that different methods of information extraction were required to be combined in an operational workflow, and that new validation strategies were needed for quality assessment. A total of 31,698 biotope complexes were delineated for the entire Stuttgart Region, with an average size of 11.5 ha for each complex. Approximately 86 percent of the biotope complex boundaries were shown to have been correctly delineated.
