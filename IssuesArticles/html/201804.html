                Landslide risk assessment based on Differential InterferometricSARanalyses (DInSAR) is associated with a number of error effects. We here approach the problem of assessing landslide risks over mountainous areas, whereDInSARobservations are often influenced by orographic effects and inaccurate base topographies by employing a dedicated error compensation. In order to obtain accurate information on surface deformation, we apply corrections forDInSARinterferograms using high-resolution base topography and water vapor information obtained from a satellite radiometer. We observe that the correctedDInSARoutput is in accordance with the environmental context as inferred by geological and geomorphological settings. It is feasible to better quantify landslide monitoring schemes whenever high- accuracy atmospheric error maps and a methodology to effectively compensate for external errors inDInSARinterferograms are available. The approach in this study can be further upgraded for futureSAR-based assessments and various error correction approaches for even more precise landslide risk assessments.

                In this paper, we present an unsupervised learning framework for analyzing activities and interactions in surveillance videos. In our framework, three levels of video events are connected by Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) model: low-level visual features, simple atomic activities, and multi-agent interactions. Atomic activities are represented as distribution of low-level features, while complicated interactions are represented as distribution of atomic activities. This learning process is unsupervised. Given a training video sequence, low-level visual features are extracted based on optic flow and then clustered into different atomic activities and video clips are clustered into different interactions. TheHDPmodel automatically decides the number of clusters, i.e., the categories of atomic activities and interactions. Based on the learned atomic activities and interactions, a training dataset is generated to train the Gaussian Process (GP) classifier. Then, the trainedGPmodels work in newly captured video to classify interactions and detect abnormal events in real time. Furthermore, the temporal dependencies between video events learned by HDP-Hidden Markov Models (HMM) are effectively integrated intoGPclassifier to enhance the accuracy of the classification in newly captured videos. Our framework couples the benefits of the generative model (HDP) with the discriminant model (GP). We provide detailed experiments showing that our framework enjoys favorable performance in video event classification in real-time in a crowded traffic scene.

                The life-cycle (usability) of a control point's position is tied closely to the control point's stability, its datum, and velocity changes across a region due to crustal movement. Analyses of the coordinates of numerous control points stored in the Idaho and Montana Multi-State Control Point Database (MCPD) showed no statistical differences due to a point's stability and its physical setting. However, analyses comparing various realizations of horizontal datum revealed some significant differences. Specifically, there is >1 m difference observed between coordinates usingNAD83(1986) relative toNAD83(2011) and approximately 2 cm difference betweenNAD83(CORS96) andNAD83(2011) coordinates. A comparison of vertical coordinates derived from geoid models revealed a 30 cm mean difference betweenGEOID03 andGEOID12A, and >60 cm difference betweenGEOID99 andGEOID12A. The impact of velocity on these coordinates was apparent and varies strongly with local tectonics across the eastern Idaho study area. This study supports theNGSrecommendation to use the most current realization of horizontal and vertical datum available.
