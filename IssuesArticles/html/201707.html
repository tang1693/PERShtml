                Long-term observations of the Antarctic ice sheet will contribute to a quantitative evaluation and precise prediction of the sea level change induced by global changes in climate. This paper proposes an improved rigorous geometric modeling method for the declassifiedKH-5 ARGONsatellite images collected in Antarctica in 1960s. The scanned film images are preprocessed beforehand to enhance the quality for further analysis. Systematic errors such as lens distortion and atmospheric refraction are also considered and corrected. A scheme is proposed to measure the ground control points for the historical images based on modern image mosaic andDEMproducts. The bundle adjustment results of four blocks in regions in East Antarctica present a geometric positioning accuracy of less than one nominal pixel resolution (140 m) in both horizontal and vertical directions, outperforming the published results. A regionalDEMof the ice sheet that represents the topography in 1963 is then generated from the stereoARGONimages for the first time, the evaluation of which shows its consistency with the modern product but with great value for studying the recent change history of the ice sheet.

                Ground control points (GCPs) are necessary in order to achieve precise georeferencing of high-resolution satellite (HRS) imagery. However, measuringGCPsis costly, laborious, and time consuming. In some remote areas, we cannot even obtain well-definedGCPs. In this study, a strip constraint model is established. Based on the bias-compensated rational function model and the strip constraint model, a feasible extrapolated georeferencing approach forHRSimagery is presented. The presented approach remains effective even when the intermediate images in the strip are unavailable. Experimental results of the two ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) nadir datasets show that the direct georeferencing accuracy of theZY-3nadir images reaches only 9 to 12 pixels. With fourGCPsin the first image, the georeferencing accuracy of the other images in the strip is improved to better than 2 pixels through extrapolated georeferencing.

                Object-based image analysis and machine learning classification procedures, after field calibration and photogrammetric processing of consumer-grade unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) digital camera data, were implemented to classify tree species in a conifer forest in the Great Lakes/St Lawrence Lowlands Ecoregion, Ontario, Canada. A red-green-blue (RGB) digital camera yielded approximately 72 percent classification accuracy for three commercial tree species and one conifer shrub. Accuracy improved approximately 15 percent, to 87 percent overall, with higher radiometric quality data acquired separately using a digital camera that included near infrared observations (at a lower spatial resolution). Interpretation of the point cloud, spectral, texture and object (tree crown) classification Variable Importance (VI) selected by a machine learning algorithm suggested a good correspondence with the traditional aerial photointerpretation cues used in the development of well-established large-scale photography northern conifer elimination keys, which use three-dimensional crown shape, spectral response (tone), texture derivatives to quantify branching characteristics, and crown size, development and outline features. These results suggest that commonly available consumer-gradeUAV-based digital cameras can be used with object-based image analysis to obtain acceptable conifer species classification accuracy to support operational forest inventory applications.

                The unique climate and topography of the Tibetan Plateau produce an abundant distribution of lakes. These lakes are important indicators of climate change, and changes in lake area have critical implications for water resources and ecological conditions. Lake area change can be monitored using the huge sets of high-resolution remote sensing data available, but this demands an automatic water classification system. This study develops an algorithm for automatic water classification using ChineseGF-1 (or Gaofen-1) wide-field-of-view (WFV) satellite data. The originalGF-1WFVdata were automatically preprocessed with radiometric correction and orthorectification. The single-band threshold and two global-local segmentation methods were employed to distinguish water from non-water features. Three methods of determining the optimal thresholds for normalized difference water index (NDWI) images were compared: Iterative Self Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA); global-local segmentation with thresholds specified by stepwise iteration; and the Otsu method. The water classification from two steps of global-local segmentations showed better performance than the single-band threshold andISODATAmethods. TheGF-1WFV-based lake mapping across the entire Tibetan Plateau in 2015 using the global-local segmentations with thresholds from the Otsu method showed high quality and efficiency in automatic water classification. This method can be extended to other satellite datasets, and makes the high-resolution global monitoring and mapping of lakes possible.
