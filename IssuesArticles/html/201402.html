                A novel algorithm that employs modified white top-hat(MWTH)transform with directional edge constraints is proposed in this study to automatically extract ground points from airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) data.MWTHtransform can effectively distinguish above-ground objects that are smaller than the window size and higher than the height difference threshold. Directional edge constraints significantly decrease omission errors from protruding ground features. IncorporatingMWTHtransform and directional edge constraints enables the simultaneous consideration of the size, height, and edge characteristics of lidar data for judging above-ground objects. Experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm exhibits promising performance and high accuracy in various complicated landscapes, even in areas with dramatic changes in elevation. The proposed algorithm has minimal omission and commission error oscillation for different test sites, thereby demonstrating its stability and reliability in a wide range of applications.

                In this study we demonstrate that sample strips of lidar in combination with Landsat can be used to predict forest attributes more precisely than from Landsat alone. While lidar and Landsat can each be used alone in vegetation mapping, the cost of wall to wall lidar may exceed users’ financial resources, and Landsat may not support the desired level of prediction precision. We compare fitted linear models and k nearest neighbors (kNN) methods to link field measurements, lidar, and Landsat. We also compare 900 m2and 8,100 m2resolutions to link lidar to Landsat. An approach with lidar and Landsat together reduced estimates of residual variability for biomass by up to 36 percent relative to using Landsat alone. Linear models generally performed better than kNN approaches, and when linking lidar to Landsat, using 8,100 m2resolution performed better than 900 m2.

                A new method for the automatic extraction of parking lot structures from an aerial orthophoto is proposed which has two major stages. Line features of a parking lot are first extracted by using a line extraction method with principle orientation constraints which offers a reliable basis for the extraction of parking lots structures by emphasizing on the extraction of accurate parking line information. The structure of the parking lots are then determined from the extracted parking lines through a maximum intersection orientation method, parameter-estimating procedure, and a self-adaptive growth method. A comparative experiment is shown and the result indicates that the proposed method can effectively extract parking lot structures with high correctness, high-quality completeness, and good geometric accuracy.

                In this paper, using spatial and spectral characteristics of the WorldView-2 satellite imagery, capabilities of multi-agent systems are used for solving multiple object recognition difficulties in complex urban areas. The methodology has two main steps: object based image analysis (OBIA) and multi-agent object recognition. In the first step, segmentation and multi-process object classification based on spectral, textural, and structural features are performed. Classified regions are used as an input dataset in the multi-agent system in order to modify object recognition results. According to the results from the object based image analysis process, using contextual relations and structural features, the overall accuracy and Kappa improved by 17.79 percent and 0.253, respectively. Using knowledge-based reasoning and cooperative capabilities of agents in the multi-agent system in this paper, most of the remaining difficulties are decreased and values 90.95 percent and 0.876 are obtained for the overall accuracy and Kappa, respectively, of the object recognition results.

                For the rigorous, physical modeling of spaceborne, push-broom imaging sensors, over-parameterization and the resulting dependencies among sensor model parameters are a continuing issue causing instability and ambiguity during parameter estimation. Traditionally, this problem has been tackled by a fixed subset approach or by using a priori stochastic constraints, which generally require the user’s intuition or intervention but with no guarantee that an optimal solution is obtained. An efficient and automated procedure to find an optimal parameter subset, that is independent and meets accuracy requirements, has been developed and tested using six images from six representative sensors. The experimental results show a stable performance of the developed procedure which results in a quality subset by the evaluation criteria and tries to minimize the checkpoint misclosure (i.e., LOOCV RMSE) so that the resulting subset can be considered optimum. Therefore, the proposed procedure can be beneficial to the users and sensor model developers by providing an optimal and subjective solution to the well known over-parameterization problem in satellite sensor model.

                The combination of Rapid Eye satellite imagery and light detection and ranging (lidar) derivatives was assessed for mapping land-cover within a mountaintop coal surface mine complex in the southern coalfields of West Virginia, USA. Support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), and boosted classification and regression trees (CART) algorithms were used. Incorporation of the lidar-derived data increased map accuracy in comparison to using only the five imagery bands, and SVM generally produced a more accurate classification than the ensemble tree algorithms based on overall map accuracy, Kappa statistics, allocation disagreement, quantity disagreement, and McNemar’s test of statistical significance. Based on measures of predictor variable importance within the ensemble tree classifiers, the normalized digital surface model (nDSM) was found to be more useful than first return intensity data for differentiating the classes.
