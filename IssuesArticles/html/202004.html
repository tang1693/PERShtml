                An important and difficult point in the application of satellite imagery is refining the positioning model and improving the geometric accuracy. In this study, we focus on improvement in geometric accuracy and develop a new rational function model (RFM) refinement method. First, we derive the conversion relationship between the rigorous sensor model and theRFM, based on which we illustrate the approximate meaning of the zero-order and first-order terms of the rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs). Second, the correlation problem betweenRPCsand the influence of individualRPCson geometric positioning accuracy are analyzed and verified. The dominant coefficients that determine geolocation are then identified. Finally, a newRFMrefinement method based on direct correction of the dominant coefficients is proposed and validated. The experiments, conducted withZY3-02satellite imagery, indicate that the proposed method can effectively improve the geometric accuracy of satellite images.

                Time series of leaf area index (LAI) products are now widely used, and the temporal validation is the prerequisite for their proper application. However, a systematical comparison between different products using both direct and indirect methods is still lacking. The objective of this paper is to assess and compare the temporal performances of fourLAIproducts: Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer(MODIS) LAI (MOD)15A2, MOD15A2h, Geoland2 Version 1(GEOV1), and Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS). The study area, which is dominated by grasslands, is located in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP), and temperature is the main stress factor affecting grass growth. Both a correlation analysis with temperature and a direct comparison with temporally continuousLAIreference maps were implemented in our temporal validation experiments. The results show that no single product can capture the rapid change and the seasonal trend inLAIsimultaneously, and the compositing period used in each product determines the quality of the correspondingLAItime series. TheMOD15A2andMOD15A2hproducts, which have short compositing windows (eight days), are suitable for detecting rapid change. A grazing-induced biomass decrease that occurred around day of year 205 in 2014 in our study area was clearly revealed in these two products. For the GEOV1andGLASSproducts, which have compositing windows of 30 days and 1 year, respectively, the grazing date was shifted (GEOV1) or even invisible (GLASS). However, products with prolonged compositing windows may be more robust to observation noise, and the resulting products may be suitable for capturing the seasonal trend. This study highlights that the concurrent use of data from various sensors onboard different satellites, and the introduction of new generations of satellites (e.g.,Gaofen-6), are two promising ways to further improve existingLAItime series.

            Building Extraction from High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images Based on GrabCut with Automatic Selection of Foreground and Background Samples

                This article proposes a new building extraction method from high-resolution remote sensing images, based on GrabCut, which can automatically select foreground and background samples under the constraints of building elevation contour lines. First the image is rotated according to the direction of pixel displacement calculated by the rational function Model. Second, the Canny operator, combined with morphology and the Hough transform, is used to extract the building's elevation contour lines. Third, seed points and interesting points of the building are selected under the constraint of the contour line and the geodesic distance. Then foreground and background samples are obtained according to these points. Fourth, GrabCut and geometric features are used to carry out image segmentation and extract buildings. Finally, WorldView satellite images are used to verify the proposed method. Experimental results show that the average accuracy can reach 86.34%, which is 15.12% higher than other building extraction methods.

            Topographic and Geomorphological Mapping and Analysis of the Chang'E-4 Landing Site on the Far Side of the Moon

                The Chinese lunar probe Chang'E-4 successfully landed in the Von Kármán crater on the far side of the Moon. This paper presents the topographic and geomorphological mapping and their joint analysis for selecting the Chang'E-4 landing site in the Von Kármán crater. A digital topographic model (DTM) of the Von Kármán crater, with a spatial resolution of 30 m, was generated through the integrated processing of Chang'E-2 images (7 m/pixel) and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Laser Altimeter (LOLA) data. Slope maps were derived from theDTM. Terrain occlusions to both the Sun and the relay satellite were studied. Craters with diameters ≥ 70 m were detected to generate a crater density map. Rocks with diameters ≥ 2 m were also extracted to generate a rock abundance map using anLROnarrow angle camera (NAC) image mosaic. The joint topographic and geomorphological analysis identified three subregions for landing. One of them, recommended as the highest-priority landing site, was the one in which Chang'E-4 eventually landed. After the successful landing of Chang'E-4, we immediately determined the precise location of the lander by the integrated processing of orbiter, descent and ground images. We also conducted a detailed analysis around the landing location. The results revealed that the Chang'E-4 lander has excellent visibility to the Sun and relay satellite; the lander is on a slope of about 4.5° towards the southwest, and the rock abundance around the landing location is almost 0. The developed methods and results can benefit future soft-landing missions to the Moon and other celestial bodies.
