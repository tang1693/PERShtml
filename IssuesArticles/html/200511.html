                Assessing the conditions of coastal and shallow lagoon waters is a top priority among environmental monitoring activities, due the high ecological and economic importance of relevant resources. Satellite remote sensing offers great potential for this scope, although the interpretation of the spectral responses of shallow areas is complicated by the mixed signal coming from the water column and the bottom. This is particularly the case when using satellite data taken in few wide spectral channels, such as those of the Landsat TM and ETM= sensors, which were not specifically designed for marine applications. Relying on the hypothesis that these data are anyway informative on shallow water conditions, an unsupervised procedure was developed to separate the spectral contributions of seawater and bottom on the basis of simple approximations. The procedure is based on the simulation of different water/bottom multispectral configurations up to find out that which best fits the observed data. The validation of the procedure was carried out by its application first to synthetic images and next to two TM and one ETM= scenes taken over the Orbetello Lagoon in Central Italy. The outputs produced in the latter case were evaluated by comparison to existing ground references. In particular, correlation analyses were performed between the original and decomposed spectral signatures and the concentrations of optically active water constituents (pigments and yellow substance) measured “in situ” at dates close to those of the satellite data acquisitions. These analyses demonstrated the potential of the methodology, while also highlighting some limitations which could be overcome through the use of imagery taken by sensors with enhanced spectral and radiometric features.

                This paper compares different image processing routines to identify suitable remote sensing variables for urban classification in the Marion County, Indiana, USA, using a Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image. The ETM+ multispectral, panchromatic, and thermal images are used. Incorporation of spectral signature, texture, and surface temperature is examined, as well as data fusion techniques for combining a higher spatial resolution image with lower spatial resolution multispectral images. Results indicate that incorporation of texture from lower spatial resolution images or of a temperature image cannot improve classification accuracies. However, incorporation of textures derived from a higher spatial resolution panchromatic image improves the classification accuracy. In particular, use of data fusion result and texture image yields the best classification accuracy with an overall accuracy of 78 percent and a kappa index of 0.73 for eleven land use and land cover classes.

                Since 1999, very high spatial resolution satellite data represent the surface of the Earth with more detail. However, information extraction by per pixel multispectral classification techniques proves to be very complex owing to the internal variability increase in land-cover units and to the weakness of spectral resolution. Image segmentation before classification was proposed as an alternative approach, but a large variety of segmentation algorithms were developed during the last 20 years, and a comparison of their implementation on very high spatial resolution images is necessary. In this study, four algorithms from the two main groups of segmentation algorithms (boundary-based and region-based) were evaluated and compared. In order to compare the algorithms, an evaluation of each algorithm was carried out with empirical discrepancy evaluation methods. This evaluation is carried out with a visual segmentation of Ikonos panchromatic images. The results show that the choice of parameters is very important and has a great influence on the segmentation results. The selected boundary-based algorithms are sensitive to the noise or texture. Better results are obtained with region-based algorithms, but a problem with the transition zones between the contrasted objects can be present.

            Geometric Accuracy Evaluation of the DEM Generated by the Russian TK-350 Stereo Scenes Using the SRTM X- and C-band Interferometric DEMs

                TK-350 stereo-scenes covering 200 km μ 300 km on the ground with a base-to-height-ratio of 0.52 have been analysed on Zonguldak testfield in the northwest of Turkey. The pixel size on the ground is 10 m. Control points digitised from 1:25 000 scale topographic maps have been used in the test. The sensor orientation was executed by the PCI Geomatica®V8.2 software package. TK-350 stereo-images can yield 3D geopositioning to an accuracy of about 10 m horizontally and 17 m vertically. Based on this orientation, DEM with 40 m cell size was generated by the related module of PCI system. For the validation of extracted DEM, matched data was checked against the interferometric DEMs from SRTM X- and C-band SAR data. Based on this comparison, the RMSE of Z values was found to be in the range of 25.6 to 36.9 m and 28.7 to 38.7 m outside and inside the forest area, respectively. However, accuracy results obtained against the SRTM C-band DEM are more representative than those of X-band since the coverage of C-band DEM on the interest area is larger than the X-band. There are some systematic shifts of the TK-350 DEM against the SRTM DEMs which lie between the 3.7 m to 6.2 m which is probably due to the different sensor orientation of TK-350 and SRTM datasets. Height discrepancies are also analysed as a function of terrain slope. It was found that slope depending components were always larger in the case of C-band DEM because of its larger cell spacing. In the forest areas, more dependency upon the slope was observed against the open areas.

                Forest regeneration assessment is an important forest management goal that requires accurate data about site-specific forest type and stand density. In this study, a methodology was developed to convert regression model output to maps of predicted softwood and hardwood percent cover at the scale of a Landsat ETM+ pixel. These maps provide forest type and percent cover at higher spatial scale (0.09 ha) than traditional GIS forest stand databases employ (e.g., 2 to 4 ha minimum mapping units). A modified accuracy assessment was performed between the Landsat regression derived maps and GIS type maps to evaluate their relative agreement. Two variations of the traditional error matrix were examined. The first was a “plus-one” matrix, where values next to the diagonal were included in the agreement calculations. The second variation, considered most appropriate for this study, included the use of “fuzzy logic” where the off-diagonal values were weighted for a better approximation of the GIS forest mapping criteria and forest type composition of the northern New England forest. The fuzzy logic error matrix indicated strong agreement between the regression derived and GIS forest type maps with an overall agreement ranging from 76 percent to 79 percent. Producer’s agreement from the fuzzy-logic error matrices ranged from 89 percent to 97 percent for softwood classes and 72 percent to 77 percent for hardwood. User’s agreement for softwood ranged from 71 percent to 82 percent and 80 percent to 87 percent for hardwood. These results suggest that the Landsat-derived maps can provide objective and reliable site-specific forest type and percent cover information that is not dependent on subjective photo interpretation methods. These maps will be evaluated in future studies to demonstrate practical forest regeneration management applications.

                This study evaluates six different approaches to classifying and mapping fire severity using multi-temporal Landsat Thematic Mapper data. The six approaches tested include: two based on temporal image differencing and ratioing between pre-fire and post-fire images, two based on principal component analysis of pre- and post-fire imagery, and two based on artificial neural networks, one using just post-fire imagery and the other both pre- and post-fire imagery. Our results demonstrated the potential value for any of these methods to provide quantitative fire severity maps, but one of the image differencing methods (ND4/7) provided a flexible, robust, and analytically simple approach that could be applied anywhere in the Continental U.S.Based on the results of this test, the ND4/7 was implemented operationally to classify and map fire severity over 1.2 million hectares burned in the Northern Rocky Mountains and Northern Great Plains during the 2000 fire season, as well as the 2001 fire season (Gmelin and Brewer, 2002). Approximately the same procedure was adopted in 2001 by the USDA Forest Service, Remote Sensing Applications Center to produce Burned Area Reflectance Classifications for national-level support of Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation activities (Orlemann, 2002).

                In this paper, we describe an “Adaptive Patch Projection” scheme that can accelerate the orthorectification for satellite images without losing accuracy. The proposed scheme is comprised of two major components: (a) orbit modeling, and (b) image orthorectification. In orbit modeling, we provide a collocation procedure to determine the precise orbits. In image orthorectification, the area of interest is sequentially subdivided into four quadrate tiles until a specified threshold for terrain variations is met. The threshold of maximum terrain variation in a tile will be optimized according to the computational efficiency and the accuracy requirements. Once the ground tiles are determined, we perform adaptive patch projection to the corresponding image pixels. Test images from SPOT5 Supermode and QuickBird satellites are included. The experimental results show that this algorithm can minimize the orthorectification computation time, while the modeling error is insignificant.
