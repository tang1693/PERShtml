                With respect to the inevitable mis-registration and shadow effects on change detection analysis, we propose objectbased post-classification of the Multivariate Alteration Detection components (OB-MAD). Very high spatial resolution images of drained, managed wetland ponds were used to compare the proposed OB-MAD method with three commonly used classification methods in terms of minimizing the influence of mis-registration and shadow on the change detection analysis: (a) the traditional MAD method with thresholds (Threshold-MAD), (b) a pixel-based postclassification of MAD components with decision tree analysis (PB-MAD), and (c) a traditional object-based postclassification method (OB-traditional). The OB-MAD method, which utilizes shape and textural information of objects derived from MAD components, produced the highest accuracy with respect to wetland change detection and successfully minimized the influence from the geometric distortion and shadow on the changed area.

                In 2009, the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry released a new global digital elevation model (GDEM) derived from reprocessed Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data from the Terra satellite. An initial, empirical assessment of the accuracy and characteristics of the GDEM was carried out using a globally-distributed sample dataset. Statistical and visual analyses of the GDEM, using known reference DEMs and ground control points (GCPs) for comparison, revealed a systematic bias in the ASTER GDEM elevations, higher average noise levels, and a lower effective ground resolution compared to the reference data, as well as numerous topo-graphic artifacts and anomalies. The GDEM appears to meet its accuracy specifications when compared to the reference DEMs, but compared to the GCPs, some of the areas are questionable. In areas that lack good quality terrain data, the GDEM may prove useful, but must be used with care.

            Developing Snow Cover Parameters Maps from MODIS, AMSR-E, and Blended Snow Products

                Snow cover onset date (SCOD), snow cover end date (SCED), and snow cover duration (SCD) are important parameters for providing comprehensive characteristics of regional or global snow cover conditions and are traditionally derived from in situ observations. In this study, we test three methods, two new (1 and 2) and one published (W_X), in deriving those parameters from remotely sensed snow cover maps, i.e., AMSR-E, MODIS multi-day combined (MODISMC8), and MODIS/AMSR-E blended. These image-derived parameters are evaluated against those from in situ measurements at 244 SNOTEL stations in the Pacific Northwest, during the 2006 to 2008 hydrological years. Results indicate that biases are mainly from scale difference between images and in situ observations and that the Method 2/MODISMC8 combination performs the best. Three SCD maps (one for each year) have very similar distribution patterns, although the SCOD and SCED maps vary from year to year and from area to area.

            A Genetic Programming Approach to Estimate Vegetation Cover in the Context of Soil Erosion Assessment

                This work describes a genetic programming (GP) approach that creates vegetation indices (VI’s) to automatically detect the sum of healthy, dry, and dead vegetation. Nowadays, it is acknowledged that VI’s are the most popular method for extracting vegetation information from satellite imagery. In particular, erosion models like the “Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation” (RUSLE) can use VI’s as input to measure the effects of the RUSLE soil cover factor (C). However, the results are generally incomplete, because most indices recognize only healthy vegetation. The aim of this study is to devise a novel approach for designing new VI’s that are better - correlated with C, using field and satellite information. Our approach consists on stating the problem in terms of optimization through GP learning, building novel indices by iteratively recombining a set of numerical operators and spectral channels until the best composite operator is found. Experimental results illustrate the efficiency and reliability of our approach in contrast with traditional indices like those of the NDVI and SAVI family. This study provides evidence that similar problems related to soil erosion assessment could be analyzed with our proposed methodology.

                This paper analyzes the effect of the addition of historical land-use as a descriptive feature in plot-based image classification when updating land-use/land-cover geospatial databases. Several historical databases have been simulated to assess the influence and significance of this feature in the classification. The causes, nature, and evolution of classification errors as the database currency varies are analyzed; and the impact of these errors on change detection during the updating process is evaluated. The results show that the addition of historical land-use information increases the overall accuracy of image classifications. During a database updating process, changes are detected by comparing the historical land-use with the classification results. The main drawback of employing historical land-use as a descriptive feature in image classification for change detection is that the percentage of undetectable errors significantly increases as more accurate is the database information.
