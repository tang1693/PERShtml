                Remote estimation of canopy structure is important in forestry and a variety of environmental applications. Multiple Forward Mode (MFM) look-up table (LUT) inversion of canopy reflectance models is one approach for obtaining forest canopy biophysical-structural information (BSI). MFM provides inversion results from models that are not invertible directly, and has advantages in terms of software requirements, model complexity, computational demands, and provision of physically-based BSI output. Proper handling of MFM-LUT parameterization and inherent uncertainty in the inversion procedure at the critical final BSI retrieval stage is essential, and is the theme of this paper. Three approaches are presented for deriving BSI from MFMLUT multiple solution sets: reflectance equality (REQ), nearest spectral distance (NSD), and spectral range domain (SRD). These approaches were validated at a Rocky Mountain test site, for which SRD corresponded best with field data, with RMSE 0.4 m and 0.8 m obtained for horizontal and vertical crown radius, respectively. Recommendations for selecting MFM inversion approaches are provided for future applications.

                Hemispheric image processing with the goal of solar radiation determination from ground-based fisheye images is a valuable tool for silvicultural analysis in forest ecosystems. The basic idea of the technique is taking a hemispheric crown image with a camera equipped with a 180° fisheye lens, segmenting the image in order to identify solar radiation relevant open sky areas, and then merging the open sky area with a radiation and sun-path model in order to compute the total annual or seasonal solar radiation for a plant. The results of hemispheric image processing can be used to quantitatively evaluate the growth chances of ground vegetation (e.g., tree regeneration) in forest ecosystems.This paper shows steps towards the operationalization and optimization of the method. As a prerequisite to support geometric handling and georeferencing of hemispheric images, an equi-angular camera model is shown to describe the imaging geometry of fisheye lenses. The model is extended by a set of additional parameters to handle deviations from the ideal model. In practical tests, a precision potential of 0.1 pixels could be obtained with off-the-shelf fisheye lenses. In addition, a method for handling the effects of chromatic aberration, which may amount to several pixels in fisheye lens systems, is discussed. The central topic of the paper is the development of a versatile method for segmenting hemispheric forest crown images. The method is based on linear segment-oriented classification on radial profiles. It combines global thresholding techniques with local image analysis to ensure a reliable segmentation in different types of forest under various cloud conditions. Sub-pixel classification is incorporated to optimize the accuracy of the method. The performance of the developed method is validated in a number of practical tests.

            Application of Association Rule Mining for Exploring the Relationship between Urban Land Surface Temperature and Biophysical/Social Parameters

                This paper explores the relationship between remote sensing measurements of land surface temperature and biophysical/socioeconomic data by utilizing the association rule mining technique. The surfaces associated with urban uses typically radiate more heat as compared to its rural counterparts. There is a need to quantitatively analyze this contrast in temperature and the biophysical and social characteristics which influence it. Furthermore, in order to consider the urban heat island (UHI) effect, a parameterization is required to account for the urban surface characteristics impacts on the magnitude of land surface temperature (LST). The association rule mining model has demonstrated to bring in additional quantitative information concerning the relationships among urban parameters. The ASTER data from 2000 was used for the selection of appropriate variables to be used in the model. This information was then used for generating association rules between land-use land-cover (LULC) and LST information from 2000, 2001, and 2004. The results thus obtained quantitatively described the relationships between various urban parameters. It was found that there was little change in the percentage area of the LULC types from 2000 to 2004. This made the comparison of the results possible. In the case of the 2000 data, it was found that forest and impervious surfaces had strong association with temperature and scaled normalized difference vegetation index (SNDVI). Specific zones such as hospitals and universities had negative association with water. The comparison of data from 2000, 2001, and 2004 suggests that impervious surface and the zoning category of airport had a strong association. Nevertheless, the information extracted needs to be analyzed in greater detail in order to arrive at robust decision rules. Overall, the model so developed has demonstrated to be effective in predicting associations between urban LST and pertinent factors. This model could be useful for urban planners and environmental managers in quantifying rules that characterize a particular urban landscape.

            An Assessment of Geometric Activity Features for Per-pixel Classification of Urban Man-made Objects using Very High Resolution Satellite Imagery

                In this paper, we propose the use of Geometric Activity (GA) features for detecting man-made objects in urban areas using VHR satellite imagery. These features describe the geometric context of a pixel without the necessity of segmentation and can be integrated as extra bands in a per-pixel classification. Two main types of GA features were investigated: ridge features based on the well-known facet model and morphological features obtained by applying closing transforms with structuring elements of different size and shape. Our findings show a substantial increase in classification accuracy for the man-made object classes “roads and buildings with dark roof” after inclusion of GA features. Next to GA features, the use of object-based features derived from eCognition®, containing both geometric and textural information, was also investigated for per-pixel classification. Accuracies obtained with object-based features are comparable to the accuracies obtained with GA features. The inclusion of both GA features and object-based features further improves the overall accuracy. GA features and object-based features thus contain complementary information.

            Agro-ecological Interpretation of Rice Cropping Systems in Flood-prone Areas using MODIS Imagery

                This study attempts a new approach using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time-series imagery to evaluate the agro-ecological interpretation of rice-cropping systems in flood-prone areas. A series of wavelet-based methodologies were applied to reveal the dynamic relationships among annual flood inundation, rice phenology, and land-use change in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). The rice-heading dates of multi-cropping areas were estimated by detecting the local maximal points in smoothed Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) profiles, using the Wavelet-based Filter for determining Crop Phenology (WFCP) and Wavelet-based Filter for evaluating the spatial distribution of Cropping Systems (WFCS) methods. The temporal information for annual flood intensity was determined for the six annual flood seasons over the period from 2000 to 2005 by the Wavelet-based Filter for detecting spatio-temporal changes in the Flood Inundation (WFFI) method. Analysis using remote sensing techniques revealed an interaction between the regional environment and agricultural activity in the VMD. First, comparing the estimated heading date of the winter-spring rice with the end date of flood inundation showed that the cropping season for the winter-spring rice in the flood-prone area fluctuates depending on the annual change in flood scale. This result implied that the onset of winter-spring rice is spatially and temporally linked to the variable flood-recession season, and hence the annual change in flood scale. Secondly, the field survey study of the yearly change in the rice-cropping system in the An Giang province from 2000 to 2006 showed that the triple rice-cropped area in the An Giang province expanded from 2000 to 2005, because the construction of a ring-dyke system and water-resource infrastructure allowed an additional rice crop to be sustained during the flood season. However, the area of the third rice crop in the An Giang province decreased drastically in 2006 as a result of the management of pest outbreaks. Although the regional water-resource environment was gradually transformed by the construction of water-resource infrastructure, in order to achieve favorable conditions for a third rice crop during the flood season, the rapid change in land-use for agricultural activity may complicate the spatio-temporal configuration of the agricultural environment in the VMD. This case study used MODIS time-series imagery to help understand the functions of the macro-scale ecosystem, including annual flood regimes and human activity.

                Mangrove wetlands are economically and ecologically important ecosystems and accurate assessment of these wetlands with remote sensing can assist in their management and conservation. This study was conducted to evaluate airborne AISA+ hyperspectral imagery and image transformation and classification techniques for mapping black mangrove populations on the south Texas Gulf coast. AISA+ hyperspectral imagery was acquired from two study sites and both minimum noise fraction (MNF) and inverse MNF transforms were performed. Four classification methods, including minimum distance, Mahalanobis distance, maximum likelihood, and spectral angle mapper (SAM), were applied to the noise-reduced hyperspectral imagery and to the band-reduced MNF imagery for distinguishing black mangrove from associated plant species and other cover types. Accuracy assessment showed that overall accuracy varied from 84 percent to 95 percent for site 1 and from 69 percent to 91 percent for site 2 among the eight classifications for each site. The MNF images provided similar or better classification results compared with the hyperspectral images among the four classifiers. Kappa analysis showed that there were no significant differences among the four classifiers with the MNF imagery, though maximum likelihood provided excellent overall and class accuracies for both sites. Producer’s and user’s accuracies for black mangrove were 91 percent and 94 percent, respectively, for site 1 and both 91 percent for site 2 based on maximum likelihood applied to the MNF imagery. These results indicate that airborne hyper-spectral imagery combined with image transformation and classification techniques can be a useful tool for monitoring and mapping black mangrove distributions in coastal environments.

                The advent of Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) technique provides a promising resource for three-dimensional building detection. Due to the difficulty of removing vegetation, most building detection methods fuse lidar data with multi-spectral images for vegetation indices and relatively few approaches use only lidar data. However, the fusing process may cause errors introduced by resolution and time difference, shadow and high-rise building displacement problems, and the geo-referencing process. This research presents a morphological building detecting method to identify buildings by gradually removing non-building pixels. First, a ground-filtering algorithm separates ground pixels with buildings, trees, and other objects. Then, an analytical approach removes the remaining non-building pixels using size, shape, height, building element structure, and the height difference between the first and last returns. The experimental results show that this method provides a comparative performance with an overall accuracy of 95.46 percent as in a study site in Austin urban area.

In practical tests, a precision potential of 0.1 pixels could be obtained with off-the-shelf fisheye lenses. In addition, a method for handling the effects of chromatic aberration, which may amount to several pixels in fisheye lens systems, is discussed. The central topic of the paper is the development of a versatile method for segmenting hemispheric forest crown images. The method is based on linear segment-oriented classification on radial profiles. It combines global thresholding techniques with local image analysis to ensure a reliable segmentation in different types of forest under various cloud conditions. Sub-pixel classification is incorporated to optimize the accuracy of the method. The performance of the developed method is validated in a number of practical tests.

                This paper explores the relationship between remote sensing measurements of land surface temperature and biophysical/socioeconomic data by utilizing the association rule mining technique. The surfaces associated with urban uses typically radiate more heat as compared to its rural counterparts. There is a need to quantitatively analyze this contrast in temperature and the biophysical and social characteristics which influence it. Furthermore, in order to consider the urban heat island (UHI) effect, a parameterization is required to account for the urban surface characteristics impacts on the magnitude of land surface temperature (LST). The association rule mining model has demonstrated to bring in additional quantitative information concerning the relationships among urban parameters. The ASTER data from 2000 was used for the selection of appropriate variables to be used in the model. This information was then used for generating association rules between land-use land-cover (LULC) and LST information from 2000, 2001, and 2004. The results thus obtained quantitatively described the relationships between various urban parameters. It was found that there was little change in the percentage area of the LULC types from 2000 to 2004. This made the comparison of the results possible. In the case of the 2000 data, it was found that forest and impervious surfaces had strong association with temperature and scaled normalized difference vegetation index (SNDVI). Specific zones such as hospitals and universities had negative association with water. The comparison of data from 2000, 2001, and 2004 suggests that impervious surface and the zoning category of airport had a strong association. Nevertheless, the information extracted needs to be analyzed in greater detail in order to arrive at robust decision rules. Overall, the model so developed has demonstrated to be effective in predicting associations between urban LST and pertinent factors. This model could be useful for urban planners and environmental managers in quantifying rules that characterize a particular urban landscape.

                In this paper, we propose the use of Geometric Activity (GA) features for detecting man-made objects in urban areas using VHR satellite imagery. These features describe the geometric context of a pixel without the necessity of segmentation and can be integrated as extra bands in a per-pixel classification. Two main types of GA features were investigated: ridge features based on the well-known facet model and morphological features obtained by applying closing transforms with structuring elements of different size and shape. Our findings show a substantial increase in classification accuracy for the man-made object classes “roads and buildings with dark roof” after inclusion of GA features. Next to GA features, the use of object-based features derived from eCognition®, containing both geometric and textural information, was also investigated for per-pixel classification. Accuracies obtained with object-based features are comparable to the accuracies obtained with GA features. The inclusion of both GA features and object-based features further improves the overall accuracy. GA features and object-based features thus contain complementary information.

                This study attempts a new approach using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time-series imagery to evaluate the agro-ecological interpretation of rice-cropping systems in flood-prone areas. A series of wavelet-based methodologies were applied to reveal the dynamic relationships among annual flood inundation, rice phenology, and land-use change in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). The rice-heading dates of multi-cropping areas were estimated by detecting the local maximal points in smoothed Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) profiles, using the Wavelet-based Filter for determining Crop Phenology (WFCP) and Wavelet-based Filter for evaluating the spatial distribution of Cropping Systems (WFCS) methods. The temporal information for annual flood intensity was determined for the six annual flood seasons over the period from 2000 to 2005 by the Wavelet-based Filter for detecting spatio-temporal changes in the Flood Inundation (WFFI) method. Analysis using remote sensing techniques revealed an interaction between the regional environment and agricultural activity in the VMD. First, comparing the estimated heading date of the winter-spring rice with the end date of flood inundation showed that the cropping season for the winter-spring rice in the flood-prone area fluctuates depending on the annual change in flood scale. This result implied that the onset of winter-spring rice is spatially and temporally linked to the variable flood-recession season, and hence the annual change in flood scale. Secondly, the field survey study of the yearly change in the rice-cropping system in the An Giang province from 2000 to 2006 showed that the triple rice-cropped area in the An Giang province expanded from 2000 to 2005, because the construction of a ring-dyke system and water-resource infrastructure allowed an additional rice crop to be sustained during the flood season. However, the area of the third rice crop in the An Giang province decreased drastically in 2006 as a result of the management of pest outbreaks. Although the regional water-resource environment was gradually transformed by the construction of water-resource infrastructure, in order to achieve favorable conditions for a third rice crop during the flood season, the rapid change in land-use for agricultural activity may complicate the spatio-temporal configuration of the agricultural environment in the VMD. This case study used MODIS time-series imagery to help understand the functions of the macro-scale ecosystem, including annual flood regimes and human activity.

                Mangrove wetlands are economically and ecologically important ecosystems and accurate assessment of these wetlands with remote sensing can assist in their management and conservation. This study was conducted to evaluate airborne AISA+ hyperspectral imagery and image transformation and classification techniques for mapping black mangrove populations on the south Texas Gulf coast. AISA+ hyperspectral imagery was acquired from two study sites and both minimum noise fraction (MNF) and inverse MNF transforms were performed. Four classification methods, including minimum distance, Mahalanobis distance, maximum likelihood, and spectral angle mapper (SAM), were applied to the noise-reduced hyperspectral imagery and to the band-reduced MNF imagery for distinguishing black mangrove from associated plant species and other cover types. Accuracy assessment showed that overall accuracy varied from 84 percent to 95 percent for site 1 and from 69 percent to 91 percent for site 2 among the eight classifications for each site. The MNF images provided similar or better classification results compared with the hyperspectral images among the four classifiers. Kappa analysis showed that there were no significant differences among the four classifiers with the MNF imagery, though maximum likelihood provided excellent overall and class accuracies for both sites. Producer’s and user’s accuracies for black mangrove were 91 percent and 94 percent, respectively, for site 1 and both 91 percent for site 2 based on maximum likelihood applied to the MNF imagery. These results indicate that airborne hyper-spectral imagery combined with image transformation and classification techniques can be a useful tool for monitoring and mapping black mangrove distributions in coastal environments.

                The advent of Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) technique provides a promising resource for three-dimensional building detection. Due to the difficulty of removing vegetation, most building detection methods fuse lidar data with multi-spectral images for vegetation indices and relatively few approaches use only lidar data. However, the fusing process may cause errors introduced by resolution and time difference, shadow and high-rise building displacement problems, and the geo-referencing process. This research presents a morphological building detecting method to identify buildings by gradually removing non-building pixels. First, a ground-filtering algorithm separates ground pixels with buildings, trees, and other objects. Then, an analytical approach removes the remaining non-building pixels using size, shape, height, building element structure, and the height difference between the first and last returns. The experimental results show that this method provides a comparative performance with an overall accuracy of 95.46 percent as in a study site in Austin urban area.
