                Both UAV photogrammetry and lidar have become common in deriv- ing three-dimensional models of urban scenes, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. However, the fusion of these multi- source data is still challenging, in which registration is one of the most important stages. In this paper, we propose a method of coarse point cloud registration which consists of two steps. The first step is to extract urban building facades in both an oblique photogram- metric point cloud and a lidar point cloud. The second step is to align the two point clouds using the extracted building facades. Object Vicinity Distribution Feature (Dijkman and Van Den Heuvel 2002) is introduced to describe the distribution of building facades and register the two heterologous point clouds. This method provides a good initial state for later refined registration process and is transla - tion, rotation, and scale invariant. Experiment results show that the accuracy of this proposed automatic registration method is equiva- lent to the accuracy of manual registration with control points.

                Over the last two decades, urban growth has become a major issue in Lahore, accelerating land surface temperature (LST) rise. The present study focused on estimating the current situation and simulating the future LST patterns in Lahore using remote sensing data and machine learning models. The semi-automated classification model was applied for the estimation of LST from 2000 to 2020. Then, the cellular automata-artificial neural networks (CA-ANN) module was implemented to predict future LST patterns for 2030 and 2040, respectively. Our research findings revealed that an average of 2.8 °C of land surface temperature has increased, with a mean LST value from 37.25 °C to 40.10 °C in Lahore during the last two decades from 2000 to 2020. Moreover, keeping CA-ANN simulations for land surface temperature, an increase of 2.2 °C is projected through 2040, and mean LST values will be increased from 40.1 °C to 42.31 °C by 2040. The CA-ANN model was validated for future LST simulation with an overall Kappa value of 0.82 and 86.2% of correctness for the years 2030 and 2040 using modules for land-use change evaluation. The study also indicates that land surface temperature is an important factor in environmental changes. Therefore, it is suggested that future urban planning should focus on urban rooftop plantations and vegetation conservation to minimize land surface temperature increases in Lahore.

                The permanganate index (CODMn), defined as a comprehensive index to measure the degree of surface water pollution by organic matter and reducing inorganic matter, plays an important role in indicating water pollution and evaluating aquatic ecological health. However, remote sensing monitoring of water quality is presently focused mainly on phytoplankton, suspended particulate matter, and yellow substance, while there is still great uncertainty in the retrieval of CODMn. In this study, the Landsat-8 surface reflectance data set from Google Earth Engine and in situ CODMnmeasurements were matched. The support vector regression (SVR) machine learning model was calibrated using the matchups. With the SVR model, this study estimates the CODMnin Hongze Lake, presents the historical spatiotemporal CODMndistributions, and discusses the affecting factors of the change trend of the CODMnin Hongze Lake. The results showed that the SVR model adequately estimated CODMn, with a sum squared error of 1.49 mg2/L2, a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.95, and a root mean square error of 0.15 mg/L. CODMnin Hongze Lake was high in general and showed a decreasing trend in the past decade. Huai River, Xinsu River, and Huaihongxin River were still the main sources of oxygen-consuming pollutants in Hongze Lake. The wetland natural reserve near Yugou had a significant effect on reducing CODMn. This study provides not only a scientific reference for the management of CODMnin Hongze Lake, but also a feasible scheme for remote sensing monitoring of CODMnin inland water.

                The Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration (YRDUA) is one of the most active economic development regions in China. However, the YRDUA is facing the severe test of sustainable development. Therefore, this study evaluates the urban comprehensive carrying capacity (UCCC) of cities in the YRDUA from 2009 to 2019 from natural, social, and economic perspectives, and uses the Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression model to analyze driving factors of spatiotemporal variations of the UCCC. Besides, this study divides the UCCC into three levels: high, medium, and low. The results indicate that: 1) there is a significant spatial heterogeneity of the UCCC in the YRDUA; 2) the UCCC in the YRDUA is generally at medium level and presents a gradually increasing trend; 3) 10 driving factors significantly affect the UCCC, and the influence intensity is non-stationary in time and space. These findings can provide references for improving the UCCC in the YRDUA.
