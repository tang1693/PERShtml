                This paper assesses the potential of a single HYSPIRI scene to estimate cover of the non-native invasive buffelgrass (Pennisetum ciliare) in a heterogeneous Sonoran Desert scrub ecosystem. We simulated HYSPIRI (60 m) along with two multispectral sensors, Thematic Mapper (TM; 30 m) and Advanced Space-borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Spectrometer (ASTER; 15 m), from high-resolution Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS; 3.2 m) imagery in an area infested by buffelgrass near Tucson, Arizona. We compared classification accuracies of all simulated sensors at spatial resolutions of 15 m, 30 m, and 60 m to evaluate tradeoffs of spectral and spatial resolution across the sensors. Although spectroscopically superior to Landsat TM and ASTER, ASTER easily outperformed HYSPIRI for small infestations (225 m2) on account of its spatial resolution. Shortwave-infrared bands near 2.2 µm were key indicators for both HYSPIRI and ASTER, highlighting the benefit of narrow-wave SWIR for mapping invasive species in arid ecosystems.

                In this paper, the system errors produced by the most widely used ideal panoramic camera model for a close-range multi-camera rig are indicated and analytically modeled according to a rigorous panoramic camera model, and a comprehensive comparison between the two models is given. First, the 3D localization errors of the ideal model are analyzed that shows the correlations with the object-image distance and the viewing angles. Second, the epipolar errors are analyzed and are observed to exhibit changes with the rotation angles and z-coordinates of the image points. Finally, tests are carried out in space resection, epipolar constraints, and bundle adjustment with different sensor models. The outdoor tests with small object-image distance (several meters) show the difference between the two models is notably slight. In contrast, the indoor tests with larger object-image distance (more than 15 m) show the rigorous model produces 2 cm better measurement accuracy than the ideal.

                Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) image processing has become a hot research topic in SAR remote sensing field in recent years. However, due to the complexity of the image and limited availability of advanced techniques, PolSAR image processing is still a challenging issue. In this paper the suggestion of ensemble learning (EL) is introduced into PolSAR image classification by integrating various polarimetric features and multiple classifiers. The most popular ensemble learning methods, including Bagging, AdaBoost, and Rotation Forest are adopted to combine multiple classifiers and polarimetric features. The proposed classification scheme is evaluated on three real PolSAR data. Experimental results shows that the covariance and coherence features can give better performance than other polarimetric decomposition features, and complementary between different polarimetric decomposition features improving the classification performance. Although a weak classifier gives unsatisfactory classification accuracy on polarimetric decomposition features, the performance can be highly improved by using EL strategies.

            Mapping India on Large Scales - A Quick and Viable Solution

                For most of the mapping and engineering survey projects, the heights are still required above Mean Sea Level (MSL), whereas the heights given by Global Positioning System (GPS) are in terms of the WGS84 ellipsoid. The heights above MSL are called Orthometric Heights. Presently for India and many other countries, who have not yet established their own geoid, there is no method to convert the ellipsoidal heights to Orthometric heights. For such countries, the only way available to obtain Orthometric heights is through establishing a dense network of leveling lines that is very time consuming, cumbersome, and manpower- and cost-intensive. An alternative solution has been proposed that requires only a very few ground control points to be provided by GPS and a skeletal leveling network for large scale photogrammetric mapping without compromising accuracy. The concept has been validated with the aid of two test areas. It is shown that by adopting the proposed method, there is a significant reduction in the required number of GPS control points by more than 55 percent and the number of MSL height control points (as also the preprocessing/postpointing effort) by as much as 90 percent.

            Nested Regression Based Optimal Selection (NRBOS) of Rational Polynomial Coefficients

                Although the rational function model (RFM) is widely applied in photogrammetry, the application of terrain-dependent RFM is limited because of the requirement for numerous ground control points (GCPs) and the strong correlation between the coefficients. A new method, NRBOS, based on nested regression was proposed to select the optimal RPCs automatically and to gain stable solutions of terrain-dependent RFM using a small amount of GCPs. Different types of images, including QuickBird, SPOT5, Landsat-5, and ALOS, were involved in the tests. NRBOS method performed better than conventional methods in estimating RPCs, and even provided a reliable solution when less than 39 GCPs were used. Additionally, the test results showed that the simplified RPCs are almost as accurate as the vendor-provided RPCs. Consequently, in favorable situations such as when the orientation parameters of the satellite are not available or are not sufficiently accurate, the proposed method has the potential to take the place of the regular terrain-independent RFM.

            A Statistical Model Inspired by the National Map Accuracy Standard

                This work proposes a statistical model inspired by the National Map Accuracy Standard pass/fail philosophy. The model is formulated as the composition of a statistical Binomial model on other statistical base models (parametric or nonparametric). This formulation allows adapting of the pass/fail philosophy of the NMAS to any desired statistical base model, tolerance, percentage of points in error, and risks. The main contribution of this proposal is a common framework for dealing with sampling and risks with independence of the underlying base model (parametric or nonparametric). The use of nonparametric base models is explained and exemplified for the 1D case. For 2D and 3D, the Gaussian base model has been adopted. The Gaussian models allow the combining of error components by means of the Chi Squared and the Gamma distributions. For the 2D case, different situations have been considered in order to analyze the pass/fail behavior, and producer’s and user’s risks.

                Although the rational function model (RFM) is widely applied in photogrammetry, the application of terrain-dependent RFM is limited because of the requirement for numerous ground control points (GCPs) and the strong correlation between the coefficients. A new method, NRBOS, based on nested regression was proposed to select the optimal RPCs automatically and to gain stable solutions of terrain-dependent RFM using a small amount of GCPs. Different types of images, including QuickBird, SPOT5, Landsat-5, and ALOS, were involved in the tests. NRBOS method performed better than conventional methods in estimating RPCs, and even provided a reliable solution when less than 39 GCPs were used. Additionally, the test results showed that the simplified RPCs are almost as accurate as the vendor-provided RPCs. Consequently, in favorable situations such as when the orientation parameters of the satellite are not available or are not sufficiently accurate, the proposed method has the potential to take the place of the regular terrain-independent RFM.

                This work proposes a statistical model inspired by the National Map Accuracy Standard pass/fail philosophy. The model is formulated as the composition of a statistical Binomial model on other statistical base models (parametric or nonparametric). This formulation allows adapting of the pass/fail philosophy of the NMAS to any desired statistical base model, tolerance, percentage of points in error, and risks. The main contribution of this proposal is a common framework for dealing with sampling and risks with independence of the underlying base model (parametric or nonparametric). The use of nonparametric base models is explained and exemplified for the 1D case. For 2D and 3D, the Gaussian base model has been adopted. The Gaussian models allow the combining of error components by means of the Chi Squared and the Gamma distributions. For the 2D case, different situations have been considered in order to analyze the pass/fail behavior, and producer’s and user’s risks.
