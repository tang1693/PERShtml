                This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for the accuracy assessment of taxonomically diverse LULC maps. A widely accepted difficulty in assessing such maps is associated with the vagueness in the interpretation of complex landscapes. For every class of the map, this method quantified the thematic and positional fuzziness of accuracy, induced by this difficulty. The labeling protocol consisted of a fuzzy comparison between the map and a reference maplet, for which degrees of positional and thematic tolerance can be user-defined. The construction of reference maplets permitted a flexible analysis (comparable with the assessment of other maps) of the positional fuzziness of the reference dataset and of the vagueness of the assessment process, while the alternate evaluation protocol, based on traditional point like data collection, did not allow such analysis.

                Future sea level rise caused by climate change would disrupt the physical processes, economic activities, and social systems in coastal regions. Based on a hypothetical global sea level increase of one to six meters, we developed GIS methods to assess and visualize the global impacts of potential inundation using the best available global datasets. After susceptible areas were delineated, we estimated that the size of the areas is between 1.055 (one meter) to 2.193 million km2(six meters). Population in the susceptible areas was estimated to range from 108 (one meter) to 431 million (six meters) people. Among the seven land-cover types in the susceptible areas, forest and grassland account for more than 60 percent for all the increments of sea level rise. A suite of interactive visuali-zation products was also developed to understand and communicate the ramifications of potential sea level rise.

            Forest Type Mapping using Object-specific Texture Measures from Multispectral Ikonos Imagery

                This study investigated the use of a geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) approach with the incorporation of object-specific grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture measures from a multispectral Ikonos image for delineation of deciduous, evergreen, and mixed forest types in Guilford Courthouse National Military Park, North Carolina. A series of automated segmentations was produced at a range of scales, each resulting in an associated range of number and size of objects (or segments). Prior to classification, the spatial autocorrelation of each segmentation was evaluated by calculating Moran’s I using the average image digital numbers (DNs) per segment. An initial assumption was made that the optimal segmentation scales would have the lowest spatial autocorrelation, and conversely, that over- and under-segmentation would result in higher autocorrelation between segments. At these optimal segmentation scales, the automated segmentation was found to yield information comparable to manually interpreted stand-level forest maps in terms of the size and classification of images identified from a spatial autocorre-lation analysis to have an optimal segmentation, compared to those determined to have over- and under-segmentation. An overall accuracy of 79 percent with a Kappa of 0.65 was obtained at the optimal segmentation scale of 19. The addition of object-specific GLCM multiple texture analysis improved classification accuracies up to a value of 83 percent overall accuracy and a Kappa of 0.71 by reducing the confusion between evergreen and mixed forest types. Although some misclassification still remained because of local segmentation quality, a visual assessment of the texture-enhanced GEOBIA classification generally agreeable with manually interpreted forest types.

            Developing Collaborative Classifiers using an Expert-based Model

                This paper presents a hierarchical, multi-stage adaptive strategy for image classification. We iteratively apply various classification methods (e.g., decision trees, neural networks), identify regions of parametric and geographic space where accuracy is low, and in these regions, test and apply alternate methods repeating the process until the entire image is classified. Currently, classifiers are evaluated through human input using an expert-based system; therefore, this paper acts as the proof of concept for collaborative classifiers. Because we decompose the problem into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks, our classification exhibits increased flexibility compared to existing methods since classification methods are tailored to the idiosyncrasies of specific regions. A major benefit of our approach is its scalability and collaborative support since selected low-accuracy classifiers can be easily replaced with others without affecting classification accuracy in high accuracy areas. At each stage, we develop spatially explicit accuracy metrics that provide straightforward assessment of results by non-experts and point to areas that need algorithmic improvement or ancillary data. Our approach is demonstrated in the task of detecting impervious surface areas, an important indicator for human-induced alterations to the environment, using a 2001 Landsat scene from Las Vegas, Nevada.

                Methodologies are developed and assessed for the delineation of urban areas on moderate resolution satellite images based on line feature extraction and processing. It is argued that a simple two component urban/rural road network model and a preliminary estimate of the extent of urban cover in a satellite scene can be used to quantify processing settings, such as line thresholds. As a result, urban delineation can be fully automated. Tests have been conducted with Landsat Thematic Mapper data of a candidate set of cities that exemplify the spectrum of North American urban landscapes. Producer accuracies in the range 60 to 80 percent are consistently for a variety of urban landscapes. While these performance levels are lower than those previously reported for small area, city-specific studies, they are comparable to those previously achieved in large-area, approaches (e.g., the National Land Cover Dataset initiative) that rely primarily on spectral attributes. It is concluded that better integrated use of spectral-spatial data processing have the potential to lead to improved operational urban mapping accuracies.

            Traffic Monitoring using Very High Resolution Satellite Imagery

                Very high resolution satellite images allow automated monitoring of road traffic conditions. Satellite surveillance has several obvious advantages over current methods, which consist of expensive single-point measurements made from pressure sensors, video surveillance, etc., in/or close to the road. The main limitation of using satellite surveillance is the time resolution; the continuously changing traffic situation must be deduced from a snapshot image. In cooperation with the Norwegian Road Authorities, we have developed an approach for detection of vehicles in Quick-Bird images. The algorithm consists of a segmentation step followed by object-based maximum likelihood classification. Additionally, we propose a new approach for prediction of vehicle shadows. The shadow information is used as a contextual feature in order to improve classification. The correct classification rate was 89 percent, excluding noise samples. The proposed method tends to underestimate the number of vehicles when compared to manual counts and in-road equipment counts.

                Vehicle counts and truck percentages are important input variables in both noise pollution and air quality models, but the acquisition of these variables through fixed-point methods can be expensive, labor-intensive, and provide incomplete spatial sampling. The increasing availability and decreasing cost of high spatial resolution imagery provides an opportunity to improve the descriptive ability of traffic volume analysis. This study describes an object-based classification technique to extract vehicle volumes and vehicle type distributions from aerial photos sampled throughout a large metropolitan area. We developed rules for optimizing segmentation parameters, and used feature space optimization to choose classification attributes and develop fuzzy-set memberships for classification. Vehicles were extracted from street areas with 91.8 percent accuracy. Furthermore, separation of vehicles into classes based on car, medium-sized truck, and buses/heavy truck definitions was achieved with 87.5 percent accuracy. We discuss implications of these results for traffic volume analysis and parameterization of existing noise and air pollution models, and suggest future work for traffic assessment using high-resolution remotely-sensed imagery.
