                The second part of this article examines the transition of midrange terrestrial laser scanning (TLS)–from applied research to applied markets. It looks at the crossover of technologies; their connection to broader developments in computing and microelectronics; and changes made based on application. The shift from initial uses in on-board guid- ance systems and terrain mapping to tripod-based survey for as-built documentation is a main focus. Origins of terms like digital twin are identified and, for the first time, the earliest examples of cultural heritage (CH) based midrangeTLSscans are shown and explained. Part two of this history of laser scanning is a comprehensive analysis upto the year 2020.

                Forests are an extremely valuable natural resource for human development. Satellite remote sensing technology has been widely used in global and regional forest monitoring and management. Accurate data on forest degradation and disturbances due to forest fire is important to understand forest ecosystem health and forest cover conditions. For a long time, satellite-based global burned area products were only available at coarse native spatial resolution, which was difficult for detecting small and highly fragmented fires. In order to analyze global burned forest areas at finer spatial resolution, in this study a novel, multi-year 30 meter resolution global burned forest area product was generated and released based on Landsat time series data. Statistics indicate that in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2018 the total area of burned forest land in the world was 94.14 million hm2, 96.65 million hm2, 59.52 million hm2, 76.42 million hm2, and 83.70 million hm2, respectively, with an average value of 82.09 million hm2. Spatial distribution patterns of global burned forest areas were investigated across different continents and climatic domains. It was found that burned forest areas were mainly distributed in Africa and Oceania, which accounted for approximately 73.85% and 6.81% of the globe, respectively. By climatic domain, the largest burned forest areas occurred in the tropics, with proportions between 88.44% and 95.05% of the world's total during the study period. Multi-year dynamic analysis shows the global burned forest areas varied considerably due to global climate anomalies, e.g., the La Niña phenomenon.

            Mapping Understory Invasive Plants in Urban Forests with Spectral and Temporal Unmixing of Landsat Imagery

                Successful eradication and management of invasive plants require frequent and accurate maps. Detection of invasive plants is difficult at moderate resolution because target species are often located in the forest understory among other vegetation types, and so produce mixed spectral signatures. Spectral unmixing approaches can help to decompose these spectral mixtures; however, they are typically applied to only one or a few images, and thus neglect phenological variability that may improve invasive species discrimination. We compared two approaches to multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis for detecting Ligustrum sinense in the southeastern United States: the use of temporal signatures of endmembers from full and select-date normalized difference vegetation index time series, and conventional spectral unmixing using a single image date. Our results suggest that using temporal signatures from all available imagery may be a good choice, with minimal impact to achievable accuracy, if a priori information on phenological differences between endmembers is unavailable, or imagery for periods of high phenological difference are unavailable.
