                In this study, we explore using satellite observations to assess community recovery from natural disasters such as fires and hurricanes, supplementing the Resilience Inference Model (RIM). The RIM model has been successfully used to quantify recoveries from hurricanes along the Gulf Coast, but it relies on long-term population changes over years or decades. Our approach integrates satellite observations to enhance recovery assessment with a shorter latency of weeks or months. Using fire, vegetation, and night light data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) with daily global observations, Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite/Advanced Baseline Imager, we quantitatively evaluate fire intensity, light outage, and urban greenness changes, along with subsequent recovery, focusing on the 2023 Maui fire and selected hurricane cases along the Gulf Coast. This approach complements the RIM model by introducing quantifiable physical parameters with shorter latency, particularly beneficial in areas where census data are either unavailable or unreliable.

                India yearly experiences natural disasters such as floods, droughts, cyclones, and landslides, which not only disrupt but also significantly affect the socioeconomic activities of its people. Darjeeling, one of the most valuable districts of West Bengal, India, is located in the foothills of the mighty Himalayas. Landslides in Darjeeling, particularly during the monsoon season, severely affect the socioeconomic conditions of the local population. This research creates a landslide susceptibility map of Darjeeling using the frequency ratio model (FRM) and geographical weighted regression (GWR). The study considers 16 landslide-conditioning factors and 743 past landslide events, of which 70% are used for modeling and the remaining 30% are used for validation. The generated landslide susceptibility map categorizes the area into very low, low, moderate, high, and very high susceptibility zones. Results show that most of the study area falls within the high susceptibility zone, covering approximately 28.45% of the region. The study also reveals that the northern hilly regions of the district are more prone to landslides compared with the southern part, based on FRM and GWR. The area under curve indicates that the model achieved a 74.7% success rate. The highest value of the landslide density index was found in areas classified as having very high landslide susceptibility. Therefore, considering the landslide susceptibility, implementation of effective management strategies is essential for ensuring the future development of the district.

                This study analyzes COVID-19 response strategies in the top 30 gross domestic product countries from the first case until 30 September 2021, a period marked by increased vaccinations, the dominance of the Delta variant, and changing public health measures. We examined which mitigation efforts effectively reduced new cases and the viral reproduction rate. Vaccination policies, movement restrictions, and mask mandates were critical in reducing cases per million, while testing, public information, income support, and contact tracing were crucial for lowering the viral reproduction rate. Vaccination policies did not significantly affect the reproduction rate during implementation. The gender of leaders showed no significant effect on cases, deaths, or excess mortality, though female leaders generally implemented fewer isolation days and prioritized additional measures like movement restrictions and stay-at-home orders.

                Disease surveillance, including risk modeling, is beneficial for infectious diseases. Risk prediction maps can be used to prioritize areas to deliver vaccines reducing disease transmission. For zoonotic infectious diseases such as Lyme disease, potential vaccine deployment areas include cost-effective places key to vectors, wildlife hosts, and humans. This paper uses machine-learning techniques to develop models to predict Lyme disease risk, then uses the critical variables within the models, as well those considered principal from previous literature, to create a Lyme disease risk map and to prioritize areas for wildlife vaccine deployment. It was found that highest disease risk is in the eastern United States, especially the upper Midwest and Northeast regions, which coincides with previous literature. The study found national parks and counties within these areas to prioritize wildlife vaccine deployment. Future work includes ground-truthing of the risk map and dispersal of vaccine to priority areas.

                Rapid urbanization and population growth have intensified the need for accurate and efficient identification of residential buildings in urban planning and disaster management. This paper presents a novel approach for identifying residential buildings by leveraging multiple source data and a transfer learning model, with a case study conducted in Galveston Island, Texas. We propose an integrated framework that combines very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery, lidar data, points of interest (POI) data, and GIS-based land use information to extract features of residential buildings. We fine-tune a pretrained deep learning model with our data sets to enhance the model’s adaptability and efficiency in detecting residential buildings in the study area. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high accuracy in identifying residential buildings, with overall accuracy of 85.6% in the case study. This study also offers valuable insights into the potential of combining multiple data sources and transfer learning techniques for improving residential building identification and other related tasks in urban remote sensing applications.

                In GIScience, problems of missing data in space or time are nontrivial. We implemented a Kriged Kalman filter (KKF)‐based data interpolation and assimilation technique and tested it for mapping bathymetry at unsampled locations and times. This technique integrates the Kriging and Kalman filter computation frameworks to perform spatiotemporal data assimilation, which can produce spatially and temporally continuous bathymetric fields from samples that are scarce in space and time. The spatiotemporal bathymetric field over the estuary of the Yangtze River was mapped based on the four boat-based depth echo-sounding surveys conducted in 1982, 1997, 2002, and 2010. Our validation and verification analyses showed that the KKF assimilation model can predict bathymetry accurately and reliably at unsampled locations and times. This paper demonstrates that KKF is superior to traditional spatial interpolation methods because it informs the interpolator with the temporal component that also extends the prediction to the time domain. The experiments indicate that greater time intervals in conducting bathymetric surveys result in a more pronounced influence on the performance of KKF than the spatial sparsity of depth samples. The ability of space-time prediction of bathymetry allows underwater depth measurements to be accurately aligned with satellite images, which is essential for improving multispectral image inversion in bathymetry studies.
