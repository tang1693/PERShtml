                Fully polarimetric L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter was collected using NASAâ€™s Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) SAR and regressed with in situ measurements of basal area (BA) and above ground biomass (AGB) of mature loblolly pine stands in North Carolina. Results found HH polarization consistently displayed the lowest correlations where HV and VV exhibited the highest correlations in all groups for both BA and AGB. When plantation stands were analyzed separately (plantation versus natural), correlation improved significantly for both BA (R2= 0.65, HV) and AGB (R2= 0.66, VV). Similarly, results improved when natural stands were analyzed separately resulting in the highest correlation for AGB (R2= 0.63, HV and VV). Data decomposition using the Freeman 3-component model indicated that the relative low correlations were due to the saturation of the L-band backscatter across the majority of the study area.

                The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using dual polarization ENVISAT ASAR and ALOS PALSAR data to capture temporal and spatial variations of pasture at paddock scale in Western Australia. SAR backscatter was correlated to NDVI, NDWI, and soil moisture index (M.I) to demonstrate the capability of SAR to measure biomass, plant water content, and soil moisture, respectively. The results proved that ENVI-SAT ASAR and ALOS PALSAR are able to monitor pasture, and the ability varies with sensor parameters (wavelength, polarization, and incidence angle) and field properties (soil moisture, vegetation type, biomass level). Paddock biomass and human activities can be detected; C-band is suitable for grass biomass and L-band detects water content of grass in drying stage. HV (VH) has advantage in detecting plant water content, while VV is sensitive to soil moisture. Ground measurements of pasture biomass successfully validated part of the correlation results.

            Integrating Disparate Lidar Data at the National Scale to Assess the Relationships between Height Above Ground, Land Cover and Ecoregions

                With the acquisition of lidar data for over 30 percent of the US, it is now possible to assess the three-dimensional distribution of features at the national scale. This paper integrates over 350 billion lidar points from 28 disparate datasets into a national-scale database and evaluates if height above ground is an important variable in the context of other nationalscale layers, such as the US Geological Survey National Land Cover Database and the US Environmental Protection Agency ecoregions maps. While the results were not homoscedastic and the available data did not allow for a complete height census in any of the classes, it does appear that where lidar data were used, there were detectable differences in heights among many of these national classification schemes. This study supports the hypothesis that there were real, detectable differences in heights in certain national-scale classification schemes, despite height not being a variable used in any of the classification routines.

            Fast Hierarchical Segmentation of High-Resolution Remote Sensing Image with Adaptive Edge Penalty

                A fast hierarchical segmentation method (FHS) for high-resolution remote sensing (HR) image is proposed in the paper. FHS is completely unsupervised. It is characterized by two aspects. First, the hierarchical segmentation process is accelerated by the improved linear nearest neighbor graph (LNNG) model and the segment tree model. It runs faster than other existing hierarchical segmentation methods, and can produce multi-resolution segmentations in time linear to the image size. Second, an adaptive edge penalty function is introduced to formulate the merging criterion, serving as a semantic factor. A set of QuickBird, WorldView, and aerial images is used to test the proposed method. The experiments show that the multi-resolution segmentations produced by FHS can represent objects at different scales very well. Moreover, the adaptive edge penalty function helps to remove meaningless weak edges within objects, enclosing the relation between segments and real-world objects.

                Increasing pressure to feed the growing population with scarce water resources requires accurate and routine cropland mapping. This paper develops and implements a rule-based automated cropland classification algorithm (ACCA) using multi-sensor remote sensing data. Pixel-by-pixel accuracy assessments showed that ACCA produced an overall accuracy of 96 percent (Khat= 0.8) when tested using independent data layers. Furthermore, ACCA-generated county cropland areas showed high agreement (R-square values 0.94) when compared with three independent data sources: (a) US Department of Agriculture (USDA) cropland data layer derived cropland areas, (b) county specific crop acreage data from the Farm Service Agency, and (c) the Census of Agriculture data for the 58 counties in California. Our results demonstrate the ability of ACCA to generate cropland extent and areas over space and time, in an automated fashion with high degree of accuracies year after year, greatly contributing to food and water security analysis and decision making.

            Synergistic Use of Optical and PolSAR Imagery for Urban Impervious Surface Estimation

                Impervious surface estimation has been widely conducted with medium-high resolution optical imagery. Challenges however, remain in aspects of spectral similarity of different objects, mixed pixel, and shadows of tall buildings or large tree crowns. In order to reduce these uncertainties, this study explores the synergistic use of optical and radar remote sensing datasets in highly populated urban areas. A comparative analysis is performed between the RADARSAT-2 full POLSAR image and the SPOT5 optical image. For both datasets, the C5.0 decision tree algorithm is applied to select features extracted to build a decision tree for urban impervious surface classification. It is found in this study that optical and POLSAR images possess different merits in delineating urban land surfaces. The POLSAR data is helpful for delineating bright impervious surfaces (e.g., buildings) and bare soils, which is often a difficult task for optical data. However, the confusion between dark impervious surfaces and bare soils becomes a severe problem due to similar surface scattering mechanisms. The intrinsic characteristics of radar scattering (e.g., layover and shadow effects) also result in high uncertainties in dense urban areas. These problems are leveraged when both optical and decomposed POLSAR features are considered. The results from this study indicate that the synergistic use of optical and POLSAR data could be an efficient approach to improving the estimation of urban impervious surfaces.
