                This paper presents a satellite navigation parameters-assisted orthorectification method for the generation of a seamless, full-coverage mosaic of the Greenland ice sheet using the over 60°N latitude Declassified Intelligence Satellite Photography (DISP) imagery. The model integrates the photogrammetric bundle adjustment model and satellite navigation parameters, which are expressed by a third order polynomial solving for the exterior orientation parameters of all images and satellite navigation parameters simultaneously. This is because of the fact that not each of DISP image contains sufficient Ground Control Points (GCPs), and it is almost impossible to find out or lay out the photogrammetrically targeted points prior to 1960s in the area of above 60°N latitude. The comparison of three orthorectification methods (camera model, second order polynomial, and the proposed method) demonstrated that the proposed method could reach highest accuracy of the other two methods. Finally, two full-coverage mosaics of Greenland using 24 DISP images from the ARGON 9034A Mission and 36 images from of the 9058A/59A mission were assembled. The average horizontal accuracy (relative to the SAR Mosaic) is estimated to be 168 m in flat area, and 183 m in mountainous area. The two mosaic products have been distributed for use of research community via CD and internet through the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) at no charge.

            Correction of Positional Errors and Geometric Distortions in Topographic Maps and DEMs Using a Rigorous SAR Simulation Technique

                In the history of surveying and mapping, a large volumes of topographic maps and digital elevation models have been created at various scales throughout the world. However, positional errors and geometric distortions may exist in the topographic contour maps and their derived DEMs due to inaccurate ground control and poor navigation techniques in the early years. In this paper, we present a new technique to detect and correct positional errors and geometric distortions in topographic data based on rigorous Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image simulation and mathematical modeling of SAR imaging geometry. Our method has been successfully applied to two USGS topographical data sets in Antarctica. Using Radarsat SAR imagery, positional errors of these two data sets have been reduced from 5 km to 200 m and from 200 m to 50 m, respectively.

            Urban Land-Cover Change Analysis in Central Puget Sound

                A methodology was developed to interpret and assess land cover change between 1991 and 1999 in Central Puget Sound, Washington at several scales (landscape, sub-basins, and 90 m grid window) relevant to regional and local decision makers. Land cover data are derived from USGS Landsat (Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper +) images of Central Puget Sound. Landsat data were registered, intercalibrated, and corrected for atmosphere and topography to ensure accuracy of land cover change assessment. We apply a hybrid classification method to each image to address the spectral heterogeneity of urbanizing regions. The method combines a supervised classification approach with a spectral unmixing approach to produce seven classes: >75 percent impervious, 15 to 75 percent impervious, forest, grass, clear cut, bare soil, and water. Land cover change is identified using the direct spatial comparison of classified images derived independently for each time period. We assess that the overall accuracy of each classified image was 91 percent for 1991 and 88 percent for 1999 respectively, which produces an accuracy of 85 percent for the change analysis. Our results show that urban growth over the last decade has produced an overall 6.7 percent increase in paved area.

                This paper examines characteristics of urban land-use and land-cover (LULC) classes using spectral mixture analysis (SMA), and develops a conceptual model for characterizing urban LULC patterns. A Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image of Indianapolis City was used in this research and a minimum noise fraction (MNF) transform was employed to convert the ETM+ image into principal components. Five image endmembers (shade, green vegetation, impervious surface, dry soil, and dark soil) were selected, and an unconstrained least-squares solution was used to un-mix the MNF components into fraction images. Different combinations of three or four endmembers were evaluated. The best fraction images were chosen to classify LULC classes based on a hybrid procedure that combined maximum-likelihood and decision-tree algorithms. The results indicate that the SMAbased approach significantly improved classification accuracy as compared to the maximum-likelihood classifier. The fraction images were found to be effective for characterizing the urban landscape patterns.

                Responding to an increasing interest in studying vegetation changes over time, we review current methods of processing black and white digital aerial photographs in order to classify tree cover in pinyon-juniper woodlands. Besides applying commonly used clustering and supervised maximum-likelihood methods, we have developed a new classifier, nearest edge thresholding, which is unsupervised and based on the principals of edge detection and density slicing. Comparison of the three methods’ abilities to predict field values at plot scales of 100 m2to 900 m2shows this new method is better or comparable to others at all scales, can be easily applied to digital imagery, and has high correspondence with ground-truthed field values of tree cover.

                Seasonal snow covers large land areas of the Earth. Information about the snow extent in these regions is important for climate studies and water resource management. A linear spectral mixture model for snow-covered forests (the SnowFor model) has previously been developed for flat terrain. The SnowFor model includes reflectance components for snow, trees and snow-free ground. In this paper, the model is extended to handle radiometric effects caused by topography on mixed pixels of snow and trees through subpixel topographic reflectance modeling. Empirical reflectance models for snow and trees, based on the local solar incidence angle, are proposed (TopoSnow and TopoTree models), and integrated into the SnowFor model. Experiments with two Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images are carried out in hilly, forested terrain in Alptal, Switzerland with full snow cover. Results show that the calibrated TopoSnow and TopoTree models enhance the modeling of reflectance variability from snow-covered forests for visible and near-infrared wavelengths. The performance of four other topographic correction methods is evaluated for snow-covered forests.

                An empirical technique has been developed that is used to predict seafloor facies from multibeam bathymetry and acoustic backscatter data collected in central Santa Monica Bay, California. A supervised classification used backscatter and sediment data to classify the area into zones of rock, gravelly-muddy sand, muddy sand, and mud. The derivative facies map was used to develop rules on a more sophisticated hierarchical decision-tree classification. The classification used four images, the acoustic-backscatter image, together with three variance images derived from the bathymetry and backscatter data. The classification predicted the distribution of seafloor facies of rock, gravelly-muddy sand, muddy sand, and mud. An accuracy assessment based on sediment samples shows the predicted seafloor facies map is 72 percent accurate.
