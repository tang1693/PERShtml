                Orthorectification of high-resolution satellite images using a terrain- dependent rational function model (RFM) is a difficult task requiring a well-distributed set of ground control points (GCPs), which is often time-consuming and costly operation. Further, RFM is sensitive to over-parameterization due to its many coefficients, which have no physical meaning. Optimization-based meta-heuristic algorithms ap- pear to be an efficient solution to overcome these limitations. This pa- per presents a complete automated RFM terrain-dependent orthorec- tification for satellite images. The proposed method has two parts; the first part suggests automating the GCP extraction by combing Scale- Invariant Feature Transform and Speeded Up Robust Features algo- rithms; and the second part introduces the cascaded meta-heuristic al- gorithm using genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization. In this stage, a modified K-means clustering selection technique was used to support the proposed algorithm for finding the best combinations of GCPs and RFM coefficients. The obtained results are promising in terms of accuracy and stability compared to other literature methods.

                Analyzing rice growth is essential for examining pests, illnesses, lodging, and yield. To create a Digital Surface Model (DSM ) of three important rice breeding stages, an efficient and fast (compared to manual monitoring) Unoccupied Aerial System was used to collect data. Outliers emerge in DSM as a result of the influence of environ- ment and equipment, and the outliers related to rice not only affect the extraction of rice growth changes but are also more challenging to remove. Therefore, after using ground control points uniform geodetic level for filtering, statistical outlier removal (SOR ) and quadratic surface filtering (QSF ) are used. After that, differential operations are applied to the DSM to create a differential digital surface model that can account for the change in rice plant height. Comparing the prediction accuracy before and after filtering: R2= 0.72, RMSE = 5.13cm, nRMSE = 10.65% for the initial point cloud; after QSF, R2= 0.89, RMSE = 2.51cm, nRMSE = 5.21%; after SOR, R2= 0.92, RMSE = 3.32cm, nRMSE = 6.89%. The findings demonstrate that point cloud filtering, particularly SOR, can increase the accuracy of rice monitoring. The method is effective for monitoring, and after filtering, the accuracy is sufficiently increased to satisfy the needs of growth analysis. This has some potential for application and extension.

                Line features are of great importance for the registration of the Vehicle-Borne Mobile Mapping System that contains both lidar and multiple-lens panoramic cameras. In this work, a spherical straight- line model is proposed to detect the unified line features in the panoramic imaging surface based on the Spherical Hough Transform. The local topological constraints and gradient image voting are also combined to register the line features between panoramic images and lidar point clouds within the Hough parameter space. Experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately extract the long strip targets on the panoramic images and avoid spurious or broken line-segments. Meanwhile, the line matching precision between point clouds and panoramic images are also improved.

                To address the problem of weak robustness against geometric attacks of remote sensing images' digital watermarking, a robust watermark- ing algorithm based on template watermarking is proposed in this paper, which improves the robustness of digital watermarking against geometric attacks by constructing stable geometric attack invari- ant features. In this paper, the Discrete Fourier Transform domain template watermark is used as the invariant feature against geometric attacks, and the embedding of the cyclic watermark is used to improve the watermark robustness for recovering the watermark synchroniza- tion relationship. To achieve blind extraction of the watermark, a parameter extraction method based on noise extraction is designed. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively improve the robustness of digital watermarking of remote sensing images against geometric attacks. Meanwhile, it can also resist common image processing attacks and compound attacks.
