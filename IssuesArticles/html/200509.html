                Depressions are often removed from digital elevation models (DEMs) used in hydro-geomorphic applications. Light detection and ranging (lidar) and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (INSAR) DEMs of flat to mountainous landscapes were used to evaluate the occurrence of artifact depressions caused by the representation of surfaces using grids and random elevation error. The number of depressions in DEMs that result from grid representation was inversely related to grid spacing; however, normalizing for the number of grid cells in a DEM demonstrated that coarser grids were relatively more vulnerable to depressions. Flat landscapes containing extensive lakes experienced more depressions related to grid spacing and placement than high-relief areas. Stochastic modelling showed that error magnitude controlled the extent of vulnerability within a landscape to depressions caused by random error. Nevertheless, certain areas were likely to experience depressions regardless of the magnitude of random error, including flat areas, valley bottoms, and highly convergent topography.

                Planimetric positional error limits the accuracy of landscape change measurements based on features interpreted from high spatial resolution imagery (≤ 1 m), and this limitation depends on the magnitude of the positional error, the spatial heterogeneity of landscapes, and the spatial extent of the change detection window (the change detection resolution). For this reason, accuracy assessments of change measurements from feature-based approaches require careful evaluation of the impacts of positional errors across landscapes differing in spatial heterogeneity at different change detection resolutions. We quantified such impacts by computing the false changes produced by spatially shifting and comparing high-resolution ecological maps derived by feature interpretation and ground interpretation of 1 m resolution Ikonos imagery of rural China and 0.3 m resolution aerial photographs of suburban United States. Change detection error increased significantly as positional errors increased, as landscape heterogeneity increased, and as the change detection resolution became finer. Regression-derived relationships between change estimation error and positional error, change detection resolution, and landscape heterogeneity allow calculation of the minimum change detection window size at which it is possible to obtain change measurements of a specified accuracy given any set of feature-based ecological maps and their positional error. Prediction of this “optimal change detection resolution” is critical in producing reliable high-resolution change measurements from feature-based ecological maps.

                The performance of MERIS as a tool for mapping chlorophyll-aconcentrations in lake waters has been evaluated using simulated and measured top of atmosphere radiances for Lake Garda (Italy). MERIS observations were simulated using hyperspectral data collected by the MIVIS imaging spectrometer in July 2000. MIVIS data were radiometrically corrected at the sensor altitude using the 6S radiative transfer code. The MERIS simulation process was verified using ETM+measurements acquired at the same time of the MIVIS flight and differences between simulated and actual radiance measurements in ETM+bands 1, 2, and 3 were about 10 percent. In July 2003, a cloud-free MERIS image was available. MERIS radiances of both dates were used to describe the variation of chlorophyll-acontent in the lake that was estimated synchronously to remote observations using continuous track fluorometer data. In 2000, when the mean value of chlorophyll-awas about 6 mg/m3the best performing algorithm (RMSE=0.58 mg/m3) was a ratio of band differences using VIS and NIR wavelengths. In 2003, when the chlorophyll-aconcentration in the lake was very low (mean <1 mg/m3), a single channel centered at 490 nm was the best index in describing spatial variations of chlorophyll-a(RMSE=0.10 mg/m3). The results suggest that MERIS observations are providing useful information for assessing and monitoring chlorophyll-adistribution in lacustrine ecosystems.

                Assessment of the relationship between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and precipitation is important in understanding vegetation and climate interaction at a large scale. NDVI response to precipitation, however, is difficult to quantify due to the lag and seasonality effects, which will vary due to vegetation cover type, soils and climate. A time series analysis was performed on biweekly NDVI and precipitation around weather stations in the northern and central U.S. Great Plains. Regression models that incorporate lag and seasonality effects were used to quantify the relationship between NDVI and lagged precipitation in grasslands and croplands. It was found that the time lag was shorter in the early growing season, but longer in the mid- to late-growing season for most locations. The regression models with seasonal adjustment indicate that the relationship between NDVI and precipitation over the entire growing season was strong, with R2values of 0.69 and 0.72 for grasslands and croplands, respectively. We conclude that vegetation greenness can be predicted using current and antecedent precipitation, if seasonal effects are taken into account.

                This study demonstrates the utilization of the well-defined points to improve the reliability and accuracy of image matching. The basic principle is: (a) to triangulate a few well-defined points within the stereo model area to form a coarse triangulation; (b) to detect certain amount of corners within each triangle for further matching; (c) to propagate the matching of corner points from the reference points (i.e., the three triangle vertices) to obtain the best matching for each of these corners; (d) to dynamically update the triangulation by inserting the newly matched corner; and (e) to further detect corners and perform matching for them until a pre-defined criteria (the minimum size of triangle or the largest number of points matched) is reached. Experimental results reveal: (a) the false matching caused by the occlusion and repetitive texture is diminished; (b) the accuracy is improved, i.e., with a reduction of RMSE of check points (located in different types of terrain areas) by 12 percent to 62 percent, and a reduction of the largest error by up to two times; and (c) most building corners and boundary points of main objects could be matched directly and accurately.

                The aim of the study is to test GPS equipment receivers commonly used for natural resource management, and to quantify recording rate and positioning quality under different conditions, the objective being to assist GPS users in their choices.Four factors were evaluated: (a) the type of receiver: three ranges of GPS equipment were compared; (b) forest cover effects (three covers were tested: open cover, coppice and deciduous high forest); (c) the effects of GPS survey components: the number of recordings (between 1 and 300), the Position Dilution of Precision (PDOP) thresholding (between 4 and 50), the time interval between recordings (between 1 and 15 seconds), and the differential correction effect; and (d) the season (winter and summer).A GPS survey was carried out and a database of 140,000 readings was established, from which a large number of random rover files were extracted for each combination of factors.It appears the only factor not to be significant is the seasonal effect. The type of equipment used and the forest cover effect both modify positioning accuracy by a factor of 2 or 3, as does the use of differential correction for Trimble receivers in open cover. Increasing the number of recordings and the time interval between recordings, and decreasing the PDOP threshold, improve precision, with a different effect according to the GPS receiver and the forest cover. The effect is generally more pronounced under high forest cover. The combined effects of GPS survey components produce significant changes in accuracy at the expense of the time spent in acquiring data.

                Cloud-free optical satellite imagery simplifies remote sensing, but land-cover phenology limits existing solutions to persistent cloudiness to compositing temporally resolute, spatially coarser imagery. Here, a new strategy for developing cloud-free imagery at finer resolution permits simple automatic change detection. The strategy uses regression trees to predict pixel values underneath clouds and cloud shadows in reference scenes from other scene dates. It then applies improved histogram matching to adjacent scenes. In the study area, the islands of Puerto Rico, Vieques, and Culebra, Landsat image mosaics resulting from this strategy permit accurate detection of land development with only spectral data and maximum likelihood classification. Between about 1991 and 2000, urban/built-up lands increased by 7.2 percent in Puerto Rico and 49 percent in Vieques and Culebra. The regression tree modeling and histogram matching require no manual interpretation. Consequently, they can support large volume processing to distribute cloud-free imagery for simple change detections with common classifiers.
