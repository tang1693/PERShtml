                The Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus instrument has two selectable gains for each spectral band. In the acquisition plan, the gains were initially set to maximize the entropy in each scene. One unintended consequence of this strategy was that, at times, dense vegetation saturated band 4 and deserts saturated all bands. A revised strategy, based on a land-cover classification and sun angle thresholds, reduced saturation, but resulted in gain changes occurring within the same scene on multiple overpasses. As the gain changes cause some loss of data and difficulties for some ground processing systems, a procedure was devised to shift the gain changes to the nearest predicted cloudy scenes. The results are still not totally satisfactory as gain changes still impact some scenes and saturation still occurs, particularly in ephemerally snow-covered regions. A primary conclusion of our experience with variable gain on Landsat-7 is that such an approach should not be employed on future global monitoring missions.

                The long-term acquisition plan (LTAP) was developed to fulfill the Landsat-7 (L7) mission of building and seasonally refreshing an archive of global, essentially cloud-free, sunlit, land scenes. The LTAP is considered one of the primary successes of the mission. By incorporating seasonality and cloud avoidance into the decision making used to schedule image acquisitions, the L7 data in the U.S. Landsat archive is more complete and of higher quality than has ever been previously achieved in the Landsat program.Development of the LTAP system evolved over more than a decade, starting in 1995. From 2002 to 2004 most attention has been given to validation of LTAP elements. We find that the original expectations and goals for the LTAP were surpassed for Landsat 7. When the L7 scan line corrector mirror failed, we adjusted the LTAP operations, effectively demonstrating the flexibility of the LTAP concept to address unanticipated needs. During validation, we also identified some seasonal and geographic acquisition shortcomings of the implementation: including how the spectral vegetation index measurements were used and regional/seasonal cloud climatology concerns. Some of these issues have already been at least partially addressed in the L7 LTAP, while others will wait further attention in the development of the LTAP for the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM). The lessons learned from a decade of work on the L7 LTAP provide a solid foundation upon which to build future mission LTAPs including the LDCM.

            Landsat in Context

                Earth remote sensing has long been considered essential to human endeavors. Beginning with military reconnaissance and evolving to weather, agriculture, environmental, and disaster monitoring, remote sensing broadens our view and provides context for our actions. While the provision of airborne remote sensing data is overwhelmingly a function of the commercial sector, space remote sensing remains predominately the purview of the public sector. Most attempts to commercialize space remote sensing have failed because there has not been a consumer base large enough to finance the enormous fixed costs of designing, building, launching, and operating space remote sensing systems. This paper reviews the business models for remote sensing with a particular emphasis on the Landsat program including its history and its political economy.

            Historical Record of Landsat Global Coverage

                The long-term, 34+year record of global Landsat remote sensing data is a critical resource to study the Earth system and human impacts on this system. The National Satellite Land Remote Sensing Data Archive (NSLRSDA) is charged by public law to: “maintain a permanent, comprehensive Government archive of global Landsat and other land remote sensing data for long-term monitoring and study of the changing global environment” (U.S. Congress, 1992). The advisory committee for NSLRSDA requested a detailed analysis of observation coverage within the U.S. Landsat holdings, as well as that acquired and held by International Cooperator (IC) stations. Our analyses, to date, have found gaps of varying magnitude in U.S. holdings of Landsat global coverage data, which appear to reflect technical or administrative variations in mission operations. In many cases it may be possible to partially fill these gaps in U.S. holdings through observations that were acquired and are now being held at International Cooperator stations.

                Landsat, first placed in orbit in 1972, established the U.S. as the world leader in land remote sensing. The Landsat system has contributed significantly to the understanding of the Earth’s environment, spawned revolutionary uses of space-based data by the commercial value-added industry, and encouraged a new generation of commercial satellites that provide regional, high-resolution spatial images. ThisPE&RSSpecial Issue provides an update to the 1997 25th Landsat anniversary issue, particularly focused on the contribution of Landsat-7 to the 34+year history of the Landsat mission. In this overview paper, we place the Landsat-7 system in context and show how mission operations have changed over time, increasingly exploiting the global monitoring capabilities of the Landsat observatory. Although considerable progress was made during the Landsat-7 era, there is much yet to learn about the historical record of Landsat global coverage: a truly valuable national treasure. The time to do so is now, as the memories of the early days of this historic program are fading as we speak.

            Characterization of the Landsat-7 ETM+ Automated Cloud-Cover Assessment (ACCA) Algorithm

                A scene-average automated cloud-cover assessment (ACCA) algorithm has been used for the Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) mission since its launch by NASA in 1999. ACCA assists in scheduling and confirming the acquisition of global “cloud-free” imagery for the U.S. archive. This paper documents the operational ACCA algorithm and validates its performance to a standard error of±5 percent. Visual assessment of clouds in three-band browse imagery were used for comparison to the five-band ACCA scores from a stratified sample of 212 ETM+2001 scenes. This comparison of independent cloud-cover estimators produced a 1:1 correlation with no offset. The largest commission errors were at high altitudes or at low solar illumination where snow was misclassified as clouds. The largest omission errors were associated with undetected optically thin cirrus clouds over water. There were no statistically significant systematic errors in ACCA scores analyzed by latitude, seasonality, or solar elevation angle. Enhancements for additional spectral bands, per-pixel masks, land/water boundaries, topography, shadows, multi-date and multi-sensor imagery were identified for possible use in future ACCA algorithms.
