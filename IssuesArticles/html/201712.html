                Establishing reliable correspondence for images of the same scene is still challenging work due to repetitive texture and unknown distortion. In this paper, we propose a region-matching method to simultaneously filter false matches and maximize good correspondence between images, even those with irregular distortion. First, a novel region descriptor, represented by a structure formed by four feature points (4FP-Structure), is presented to simplify matching with severe deformation. Furthermore, an expansion stage based on the special 4FP-Structure is adapted to detect and select as many high location accuracy correspondences as possible under a local affine-transformation constraint. Extensive experiments on both rigid and non-rigid image datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has a very high degree of correctness and significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

                We present a framework for modeling architectural structure of indoor scene given unorganized 3D point clouds collected from an indoor mobile laser scanning system. The proposed pipeline employs a decomposition-and-reconstruction strategy to create the indoor structural elements on the floor plan. In contrast with existing methods, our method can deal with both inner and outer wall reconstruction through solving the optimization energy problem using graph cuts. In addition, our approach does not rely on timestamp informa- tion encoding line-of-sight information from each point to the laser scanner. It allows our algorithm to process most of the data sets. In particular, the proposed alpha-shape based door reconstruction and a hierarchical clustering technique is able to identify each room without prior information regarding the total number of rooms. Our experiments on real and synthetic point cloud scenes show that our ap- proach is robust and accurate for modeling indoor spaces.

            A Survey of Geomatics Solutions for the Rapid Mapping of Natural Hazards

                Natural hazards demand a rapid assessment of the crisis situation and the use of Geomatics platforms, sensors and techniques can efficiently answer this need. Remotely sensed data can, in fact, provide a valuable source of broad scale information at each stage of the disaster management cycle, supporting scientists and authorities in the decision-making process. Geomatics-based procedures and techniques can be especially exploited in the emergency mapping domain for the extraction of reference (pre-event) and crisis (post-event) geographic data. The major challenges today concern the efficient selection (and integration) of the most fit-for-purpose mapping solution(s) and the development of automatic procedures to increase efficiency in data processing. This survey article provides a review of the current optical remote sensing sensors (both satellite and airborne) for rapid mapping applications. Advantages and disadvantages are evaluated in order to support the selection process of the most appropriate means to gather the required information (i. e., significant and value-added data). Since valuable information should be delivered in a very short time, the management of time is defined as a priority and several solutions are discussed to pursue efficiency in both data acquisition and processing. With this in mind, the most significant issues affecting time in each step of the work-flow and overall accuracy are analyzed and reported.

            Effect of Occupation Time on the Horizontal Accuracy of a Mapping-Grade GNSS Receiver under Dense Forest Canopy

                A mapping-grade dual frequency GNSS receiver was tested under dense forest canopy to determine the effect of occupation time on horizontal accuracy. The U. S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis unit in the Pacific Northwest has been using 32 of these units to collect over 7,000 plot locations since 2013. In this study, one-hour GNSS static occupations were collected at 33 ground-surveyed positions with Trimble GeoXH6000 mapping-grade and Javad Triumph1 survey-grade receivers. Rover files were differentially post-processed and horizontal accuracy of each post-processed position was computed. Results indicated that 1.85 m accuracy (n = 990) could be achieved with the GeoXH6000 receiver with 15-minute occupations; however, maximum horizontal error was 7.01 m. Increasing occupation time to 20 minutes did not result in a significant improvement in accuracy. No correlation was found between the horizontal precision of a post-processed position reported by the postprocessing software and the field-measured horizontal accuracy of the positions.
