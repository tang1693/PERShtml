                The Chang'e-5 mission of China is planned to be launched in 2019 to the landing area near Mons Rümker located in Oceanus Procellarum. Aiming to generate a high-resolution and high-quality digital orthophoto map (DOM) of the planned landing area for supporting the mission and various scientific analyses, this study developed a systematic and effective method for large-area seamless DOM production. The mapping results of the Chang'e-5 landing area using over 700 Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) images are presented. The resultant seamless DOM has a resolution of 1.5 m, covers a large area of 20° in longitude and 4° in latitude, and is tied to SLDEM2015. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce the geometric inconsistencies among the LROC NAC images to the subpixel level and the positional errors with respect to the reference digital elevation model to about one grid cell size.

                Field data in forest inventories are increasingly obtained using proximal sensing technologies, often under fixed-point sampling. Under fixed-point sampling some trees are not detected due to instrument bias and occlusions, hence involving an underestimation of the number of trees per hectare (N). The aim here is to evaluate various approaches to correct tree occlusions and instrument bias estimates calculated with data from ForeStereo (proximal sensor based on stereoscopic hemispherical images) under a fixed-point sampling strategy. Distance-sampling and the new hemispherical photogrammetric correction (HPC), which combines image segmentation-based correction for instrument bias with a novel approach for estimating the proportion of shadowed sampling area in stereoscopic hemispherical images, best estimated N and basal area (BA). Distance-sampling slightly overestimated N (11% bias, 0.60 Pearson coefficient with the reference measures) and BA (4%, 0.82). HPC provided less biased N estimates (-6%, 0.61) but underestimated BA (-8%, 0.83). HPC most accurately retrieved the diameter distribution.

            A Novel Method for Separating Woody and Herbaceous Time Series

                Mapping the spatial distribution of woody and herbaceous vegetation in high temporal resolution in savannas would be beneficial for modeling interrelationships between trees and grasses, and monitoring fuel loads and biomass for livestock. In this study, we developed a frequency decomposition method to separate woody and herbaceous vegetation components using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series. The results were validated using fractional cover data derived from high-resolution images. The validation revealed a close relationship between our decomposed NDVI and corresponding fractional cover (R2= 0.55 and 0.64 for woody and herbaceous components, respectively). We examined the spatial and temporal patterns of the decomposed NDVI, where woody and herbaceous NDVI showed different responses to precipitation. The methods proposed in this study can be used to separate the woody and herbaceous NDVI time series as an alternative approach for monitoring woody and herbaceous vegetation interrelationships related to climatic drivers.

            Examining the Effectiveness of Spectrally Transformed SMA in Urban Environments

                Spectral transformation has been applied to address the spectral variability in spectral mixture analysis. However, there is not a study addressing the necessity and applicability of transformed models. This article, therefore, aims to answer two questions: whether significantly different results will be generated through applying a spectral transformation, and which spectral transformation performs better in urban environments. In particular, 26 spectrally transformed schemes were examined in three cities. Results of paired-sample t tests demonstrated that normalized spectral mixture analysis performed significantly better than the untransformed scheme in all three study areas. Derivative analysis, independent component analysis, and minimum noise fraction outperformed the untransformed scheme in one or two study areas but underperformed in others. Other schemes are unnecessary, as they have significantly lower accuracy compared to the untransformed scheme.
