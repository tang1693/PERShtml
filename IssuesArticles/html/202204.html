                Machine intelligent perception (MIP ) provides a novel way for human beings to recognize geographical locations automatically.MIPof geographical locations enables computers to describe locations automatically and quantitatively by extracting Earth's surface features and building relationships. The earth surface fingerprint is established here by mining the relationship between spatial objects with stable characteristics extracted from urban high-resolution remote sensing images, which realizes intelligent perception of geographical location innovatively. Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network is used to automatically extract the spatial objects such as playgrounds, crossroads, and bridges from the images. Then, the extracted spatial objects are encoded according to the landuse type, distance, and angle of 24 nearest objects to construct urban surface fingerprint database. The urban surface fingerprint database is used to match the geographical location of spatial objects in local images so that the matching algorithm can be used for machine recognition of the geographical location of specific objects in the target image. Taking the main cities in China as the experimental area, the success rate of location perception is 92%. We have made a useful exploration in the field of MIP of geographical location, hoping to promote the development of human cognition of geographical location.

                Land surface temperature (LST) has a profound impact on urban climate and ecology, and is widely used to quantify surface urban heat islands. The spatial heterogeneity ofLSTis affected by natural and human factors, with seasonal differences. This study selected Dongguan, a rapidly urbanizing city in China, as an example to analyze the relationship between the spatial heterogeneity ofLSTin different seasons and influencing factors in six dimensions. Multi-source spatial data were combined, including Landsat images, meteorological data, digital elevation models, National Polar-Orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite nighttime light, and points of interest. The results show that spatial patterns ofLSTacross different seasons were consistent, although there were local differences. Based on the GeoDetector model, the result indicated differences between separate effects and interactive effects, and identified the high temperature risk areas.

                The mapping and change detection of land cover and land use are essential for urban management. The aim of this study was to map and monitor the spatial and temporal change in urban land cover and land use in Davidson County, Tennessee in the periods of 2013, 2016, and 2020. The urban land cover and land use categories were classified and mapped using Random Forest algorithm. A combination of Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite data with Light Detection and Ranging (lidar)-Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and derived Topographic Position Index (TPI) were used in the classification and monitoring of urban land cover and land use change. The urban land cover and land use types were mapped with average overall accuracies of about 87% in 2020, 85% in 2016 and 2013. The overall accuracy increased by around 8%, 9%, and 6% in 2020, 2016, and 2013 classifications respectively when lidarDEMand derived TPIwere added to Landsat OLIsatellite data in the classification relative to standalone Landsat OLI. Total change occurred in about 63% of Davidson County between 2016 and 2020 with significant net gains and losses among land cover and land use types. This information could support land use planning.

            Use of Commercial Satellite Imagery to Monitor Changing Arctic Polygonal Tundra

                Commercial satellite sensors offer the luxury of mapping of individual permafrost features and their change over time. Deep learning convolutional neural nets (CNNs) demonstrate a remarkable success in automated image analysis. Inferential strengths ofCNNmodels are driven primarily by the quality and volume of hand-labeled training samples. Production of hand-annotated samples is a daunting task. This is particularly true for regional-scale mapping applications, such as permafrost feature detection across the Arctic. Image augmentation is a strategic "data-space" solution to synthetically inflate the size and quality of training samples by transforming the color space or geometric shape or by injecting noise. In this study, we systematically investigate the effectiveness of a spectrum of augmentation methods when applied toCNNalgorithms to recognize ice-wedge polygons from commercial satellite imagery. Our findings suggest that a list of augmentation methods (such as hue, saturation, and salt and pepper noise) can increase the model performance.

                At present, little research focuses on the application of pan-sharpening methods to SuperView-1 satellite imagery. There is a lack of suitability assessment for existing pan-sharpening methods applied to SuperView-1 images. This study proposes an evaluation method that integrates visual evaluation, spectral analysis of typical objects, and quantitative indicators to evaluate the advantages of different pan-sharpening methods in different scenes of SuperView-1 imagery. Four scenes (urban areas, farmland, sparse vegetation, mixed surfaces) are selected to evaluate eight typical pan-sharpening methods (Brovey, principal component analysis (PCA), Gram-Schmidt (GS), band-dependent spatial-detail (BDSD), high-pass filtering (HPF), smoothing filter-based intensity modulation (SFIM), modulation transfer function-generalized Laplacian pyramid (MTF-GLP),MTF-GLP-high pass modulation (MTF-GLP-HPM). The results show that the suitability of each pan-sharpening method is different in various scenes.PCA, Brovey, andGSdistort the spectral information greatly, and the stability of the pan-sharpening results in different scenes which are poor.BDSDhas strong stability and can better balance the relationship between spectral distortion and spatial distortion in different scenes. The multi-resolution analysis method has better applicability and stability for SuperView-1 imagery, among whichMTF-GLPandMTF-GLP-HPMperform better in the pan-sharpening results. This study provides a reference for the selection of pan-sharpening methods for SuperView-1 imagery in different application fields.

                In recent years, the global photovoltaic industry has developed rapidly. It is significant for evaluating the impact of large-scale solar parks on the environment for the sustainable development of the photovoltaic industry. At present, researchers have paid attention to changes in the local thermal environment caused by solar parks. As a new type of solar park, the influence of floating solar parks on urban land surface temperature distribution patterns is still unclear. In this article, we (1) take the floating solar parks in Huainan City, China, as the study area; (2) calculate the land surface temperature (LST) of the study area and its adjacent areas by using Landsat 8 remote sensing data and the radiation transfer equation method; and (3) judge the influence of solar parks on the distribution pattern of LST. On this basis, we analyzed the influence range and seasonal differences of floating solar parks on LST. Our results revealed that, first, the floating solar park has a warming effect in the summer and winter, and the warming area is concentrated mainly within 200 m of the photovoltaic panels' coverage area. Second, during the construction phase and after the completion of the floating solar parks, the average monthly LST of the solar panels is generally higher than the water, and the average annual temperature increase in the above two stages is 3.26°C and 4.50°C, respectively. The change of floating solar parks on urban LST distribution patterns may impact the local ecosystem. In the future, it is necessary to consider the impact of floating solar parks on local LST during the construction of floating solar parks.
