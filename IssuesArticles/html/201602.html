                In this paper a novel road vectorization methodology based on image space clustering technique and weighted graph theory is presented. The proposed methodology describes a road as a set of optimized points on the centerline which should be connected by defining a number of appropriate criteria. The main contribution of this paper is to design a weighting scheme for combining a small number of road identities using Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operators by defining appropriate decision strategy. In this regard, a novel geometric criterion is introduced. Result of theOWAaggregation specifies weight of each edge in the road network graph. Comparing the proposed approach with two state-of-the-art image space clustering-based road vectorization methods proves its efficiency to deal with roads with different widths, parallel roads with different distances, different types of intersections, and also noise clusters. Obtaining improved quality measures for several high-resolution images, demonstrates the successfulness of the vectorization approach.

                Image mosaicking is a process during which multiple orthoimages are combined into a single seamless composite orthoimage. One of the most difficult steps in the automatic mosaicking of orthoimages is the seamline determination. This paper presents a novel algorithm that selects seamlines based on marker-based watershed segmentation. A representative seamline is extracted at the object level and the pixel level as follows. First, a watershed segmentation is performed to obtain the objects. To avoid over-segmentation, a regional adaptive marker-based watershed segmentation is proposed. Second, the object difference estimated by the correlation coefficient of each object is calculated, and the region adjacency matrix is built. Third, a technique for minimizing the maximum object cost is adopted to determine the objects through which the seamlines pass. Finally, pixel-level optimization is performed using Dijkstra's algorithm with a binary min-heap to determine the final seamlines. The experimental results on digital aerial orthoimages in different areas demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method compared with other algorithms.

            SRTM Error Distribution and its Associations with Landscapes across China

                In this paper the distribution of 3-second elevation error in the data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) over the whole of China and its associations with topographic and land cover factors were systematically evaluated. The landscape features extracted from different datasets at more than 500,000 sites were used to determine the variation pattern in the errors by the method of single factor analysis. The results showed that the topographic attributes derived fromSRTMdata could adequately represent the terrain of China. However, there were extended and observable areas with abnormalities in a small proportion of the data. Slope was the dominant factor affecting elevation error compared with other landscape features (aspect, vegetation, etc.). The mean errors in glaciers, deserts and wetlands were -1.05 m, -2.03 m and -2.43 m, and 1.05 m in built-up areas. In general the elevation errors in theSRTMdata formed a complex pattern of variation across China.

            A Region-Line Primitive Association Framework for Object-Based Remote Sensing Image Analysis

                In this study, we propose a novel region-line primitive association framework (RLPAF) forOBIA. In this framework, segments (region primitive) and straight lines (line primitive) are obtained by image segmentation and straight line detection, respectively, before their corresponding intra-primitive features are extracted. An association model is built on inter-primitive topology and direction relationships. Several region-line collaborative features are also derived. Image analysis is then performed based on both region and line primitives. The advantage ofRLPAFis the collaborative utilization of complementary information between regions and lines throughout the entireOBIAprocess: from image segmentation, to feature extraction, and finally, object recognition. To validate this framework,RLPAFis applied on road network extraction from high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing images. Experiments show that the proposed framework and methods refine primitive shape and spatial relationship analyses, as well as obtain higher method accuracy, thanOBIAsbased on only regions.

            Sliver Removal in Object-Based Change Detection from VHR Satellite Images
        </a>

                This paper presents a novel strategy for object-based change detection using very high spatial resolution (VHR) satellite images captured under variable off-nadir view angles. The variable off-nadir angle, along with weak absolute orientation, generates spurious slivers during the multitemporal comparison of classification results. The proposed solution for accurate object-to-object comparison is based on an intermediate registration of object-based classification results with a piecewise affine transformation followed by robust, geometry-based techniques for sliver removal. Although different remote sensing applications require different strategies and methods for object-based change detection, the approach developed in this paper can overcome the overall limitation introduced by the slivers generated by weak geo-localization, variable off-nadir angles, and image segmentation.
