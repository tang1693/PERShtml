                Elongated topographic artifacts, such as the striping production artifacts described for USGS 7.5-minute DEMs, can result in globally biased estimates of slope and aspect. As such, developing methods to reduce these artifacts and their resulting biases is important. This study presents an algorithm for the mitigation of these artifacts, using Terrain Resource Information Management (TRIM) digital elevation models (DEMs) of the Fort St. John Forest District, in British Colum-bia, Canada, as the test bed. The algorithm uses a theoretical error model, where elevation measurement errors are assumed to be autocorrelated along the collection lines of the photogrammetric model, and takes advantage of the entry order of DEM points to apply a sequence of spatial filters to the elevation. A probability function is used to constrain the elevation changes to an acceptable range. The algorithm is effective in mitigating the artifacts’ effects on slope and aspect while preserving the original topographic detail.

                Given a terrain model, the viewshed from a viewpoint is computed as the set ofX-Ypositions of a point target such that the target is visible. We introduce a novel approach to the computation of accurate viewshed approximations. Our algorithm relies on the computation of an approximation to the so-called line-of-sight (LOS) function. This function is defined over targetX-Ypositions, and is the highest elevation of a target so that it is still occluded from the viewpoint. The LOS function summarizes intervisibility information and permits reuse of previous intervisibility computations, resulting in computational efficiencies. Our algorithm gives results very close to the traditional sightline ray method at a substantially smaller computational cost, and is a generalization of the approach developed by Franklin and Ray for the same problem. We describe in detail the application to gridded terrain models, but the approach is similarly applicable to other elevation models.

                The differential interferometric SAR (DInSAR) technique has proved its capability to detect small surface deformations in several types of applications. In this paper, its use as a quantitative subsidence monitoring tool is addressed to. A complete procedure is described, giving emphasis to the algorithms that have a major impact on the quality of the DInSAR results: the calibration of the InSAR geometry based on ground control points, which guarantees a high accuracy of the InSAR geometric model; a filtering procedure suitable to reduce the atmospheric effects in small-scale subsidences; and a data fusion procedure for multiple observations, which represents a key step to improve the quality of the DInSAR products. The procedure was used in the analysis of a small-scale urban subsidence located in Cat-alonia, northeastern Spain. The validation of the results, which was based on the comparison with precise and independent reference data, is discussed in detail.

            Impact of Topographic Normalization on Land-Cover Classification Accuracy

                For pixel classifying algorithms to perform effectively, effects of topographic relief must be minimized or removed. In areas of high topographic relief, problems arise when spectral variations in ground target illumination and radiance, owing to differences in incident radiation and non-Lambertian reflectance behavior, respectively, cause identical land-cover types to reflect differently, or different cover types to reflect similarly. A Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper image was processed using band ratios, the Min-naert Correction, aspect partitioning, and combinations of these treatments to generate independent land-cover classifications. Treatment classification accuracy was determined using error matrices and the Kappa statistic. Producer’s and User’s Accuracies were examined to determine if treatments were superior at producing greater class-specific accuracy. None of the treatments produced a significantly more accurate classification; however, assessment of class-specific accuracies indicated accuracy gains using aspect partitioning alone or in combination with the Minnaert Correction.

                We monitored land-cover change in San Diego County (1990–1996) using multitemporal Landsat TM data. Change vectors of Kauth Thomas features were combined with stable multitemporal Kauth Thomas features and a suite of ancillary variables within a classification tree classifier. A combination of aerial photointerpretation and field measurements yielded training and validation data. Maps of land-cover change were generated for three hierarchical levels of change classification of increasing detail: change vs. no-change; four classes representing broad increase and decrease classes; and nine classes distinguishing increases or decreases in tree canopy cover, shrub cover, and urban change. The multitemporal Kauth Thomas (both stable and change features representing brightness, greenness, and wetness) provided information for magnitude and direction of land-cover change. Overall accuracies of the land-cover change maps were high (72 to 92 percent). Ancillary variables representing elevation, fire history, and slope were most significant in mapping the most complicated level of land-cover change, contributing 15 percent to overall accuracy. Classification trees have not previously been used operationally with remotely sensed and ancillary data to map land-cover change at this level of thematic detail.

            Settlement Design, Forest Fragmentation, and Landscape Change in Rondônia, Amazônia

                Deforestation and colonization in Amazônia have attracted substantial attention. This article focuses on an area of 3,000 km2within the Brazilian State of Rondônia. Two adjacent settlements were compared to assess the role of their different designs in landscape change. Anari was planned following an orthogonal road network. Machadinho was designed with attention to topography in laying out roads and farm properties, while including communal reserves. Field research was undertaken in conjunction with multi-temporal classifications of remotely sensed data (1988, 1994, and 1998) and landscape ecology methods. The results indicate that large patches of communal reserves play an important role in maintaining lower levels of fragmentation. Analyses of landscape structure confirmed that forest patches in Machadinho are less fragmented, more complex, and preserve more interior habitat. By comparing the effects of different settlement designs on landscape change and forest fragmentation, this article contributes to the debate about colonization strategies in Amazônia.
