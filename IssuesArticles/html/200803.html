                An independent assessment of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument geometry was undertaken by the U.S. ASTER Team, to confirm the geometric correction parameters developed and applied to Level 1A (radiometrically and geometrically raw with correction parameters appended) ASTER data. The goal was to evaluate the geometric quality of the ASTER system and the stability of the Terra spacecraft. ASTER is a 15-band system containing optical instruments with resolutions from 15- to 90-meters; all geometrically registered products are ultimately tied to the 15-meter Visible and Near Infrared (VNIR) sub-system. Our evaluation process first involved establishing a large database of Ground Control Points (GCP) in the mid-western United States; an area with features of an appropriate size for spacecraft instrument resolutions. We used standard U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Digital Orthophoto Quads (DOQs) of areas in the mid-west to locate accurate GCPs by systematically identifying road intersections and recording their coordinates. Elevations for these points were derived fromUSGSDigital Elevation Models (DEMs). Road intersections in a swath of nine contiguous ASTER scenes were then matched to the GCPs, including terrain correction. We found no significant distortion in the images; after a simple image offset to absolute position, the RMS residual of about 200 points per scene was less than one-half a VNIR pixel. Absolute locations were within 80 meters, with a slow drift of about 10 meters over the entire 530-kilometer swath. Using strictly simultaneous observations of scenes 370 kilometers apart, we determined a stereo angle correction of 0.00134 degree with an accuracy of one microradian. The mid-west GCP field and the techniques used here should be widely applicable in assessing other spacecraft instruments having resolutions from 5 to 50-meters.

                In this paper a generic, rigorous sensor model for high-resolution optical satellite sensors with along-track stereoscopic capabilities is introduced. The idea is to determine the orbit of the satellite platform covering the time acquisition of all images, using satellite photogrammetry in combination with astrodynamics, trying to find common exterior orientation parameters for all images directly or indirectly. As a result, the number of unknown parameters is reduced and also the correlation between them, thus giving a more stable solution. Great effort is made in order to define the essential forces which are involved in the acquisition of the pushbroom images, according to the needed accuracy and the data provided. The fundamental assumption is that Keplerian motion is maintained along the acquisition time of all the along-track images. Various versions of the model are developed based on different orbit determination-propagation methods. An accuracy assessment is made of the above different orbit determination-propagation methods. It is possible to extract the exterior orientation of all images together directly, without ground control points and using the metadata information, with acceptable accuracy. The model is evaluated using SPOT5-HRS imagery with precision close to pixel size. Moreover, the accuracy of the along-track model is compared with the accuracy of single image sensor model.

                Complex forest structure and abundant tree species in the moist tropical regions often cause difficulties in classifying vegetation classes with remotely sensed data. This paper explores improvement in vegetation classification accuracies through a comparative study of different image combinations based on the integration of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and SPOT High Resolution Geometric (HRG) instrument data, as well as the combination of spectral signatures and textures. A maximum likelihood classifier was used to classify the different image combinations into thematic maps. This research indicated that data fusion based on HRG multispectral and panchromatic data slightly improved vegetation classification accuracies: a 3.1 to 4.6 percent increase in the kappa coefficient compared with the classification results based on original HRG or TM multispectral images. A combination of HRG spectral signatures and two textural images improved the kappa coefficient by 6.3 percent compared with pure HRG multispectral images. The textural images based on entropy or second-moment texture measures with a window size of 9 pixels√ó9 pixels played an important role in improving vegetation classification accuracy. Overall, optical remote-sensing data are still insufficient for accurate vegetation classifications in the Amazon basin.

                Multi-channel Gabor filters (MGFs) and Markov random fields (MRFs) are two common methods for texture analysis. This paper investigates their integration through a novel algorithm using the neighborhood-oscillating tabu search (NOTS) for high-resolution image classification. The NOTS algorithm fuses the texture features extracted by MGF and MRF. This algorithm has been compared with classical methods such as sequential forward selection, sequential forward floating selection, and oscillating search. Experimental results show that the fused MGF/MRF features have much higher discrimination than pure features, and NOTS outperforms other algorithms with either pure or fused features. The stability and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm have been verified using Brodatz, Ikonos, and QuickBird images.

                In this study, we developed a land-cover classification methodology using Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) visible near-infrared (VNIR), shortwave infrared (SWIR), and thermal infrared (TIR) band combinations based on wavelet fusion and the self-organizing map (SOM) neural network methods, and compared the classification accuracies of different combinations of ASTER multi-band data. A wavelet fusion concept named ARSIS (Am√©lioration de la R√©solution Spatiale par Injection de Structures) was used to fuse ASTER data in the preprocessing stage. In order to apply the wavelet fusion method to ASTER data, the principal components of ASTER VNIR data were computed. The first principal component was used as the base image for wavelet fusion. In our experiments, the spatial resolution of ASTER VNIR, SWIR, and TIR data was adjusted to the same 15 m. SOM classification accuracy was increased from 83 percent to 93 percent by this fusion, and classification accuracy increased along with the increase of band numbers. Classification accuracy reaches the highest value when all 14 bands are used, but classification accuracy closely approached the highest value when three VNIR bands, three SWIR bands, and two TIR bands were used. A similar tendency was also obtained by the maximum likelihood classification (MLC) method, but the classification accuracies of MLC over all band combinations were considerably obviously lower than those obtained by the SOM method.

                Lidar technology has provided an accurate and efficient way to obtain digital elevation models. While digital terrain models (DTMs) are essential products for three-dimensional spatial applications, extraction of ground points from a mixture of ground and non-ground points is not straightforward, and interactive classification of massive point data sets is prohibitive. To automate the filtering process, many algorithms have been proposed and demonstrated to produce satisfactory results when applied with suitably tuned parameters. For obtaining quality products using lidar filters, however, not only to figure out their optimal performance, but also to analyze the cause and effect relationships between filtering steps and their effects under variable conditions is important. Hence, this study examined the performance of three popular surface models for lidar data filtering: morphological operations, triangulation, and linear prediction. For the test, consistent setting of parameters was applied across considerably different landscape datasets. The strengths and weaknesses of the test filters were investigated by comparing the metrics of omission and commission errors and volumetric distortions, and by observing resulting DTMs and relevant surface profiles.

                The effects of an atmospheric correction method for water quality estimation have been studied and validated for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer for Applications (AISA) data. This novel approach uses atmospheric input parameters from a numerical weather prediction model: HIRLAM (High Resolution Limited Area Model). The atmospheric correction method developed by de Haan and Kokke (1996) corrects the spectrometer data according to the coefficients calculated using Moderate Resolution Transmittance Code (MODTRAN) radiative transfer code simulations. The airborne campaigns were carried out at lake and coastal Case 2 type water areas between 1996 and 1998. The water quality interpretation was made using the MERIS satellite instrument wavelengths. The correction improved most of the water quality (turbidity, total suspended solids, and Secchi disk depth) estimates when data from several flight campaigns were used jointly. The atmospheric correction reduced the standard deviation of the measurements conducted on different days. The highest improvement was obtained in the estimation of turbidity.
