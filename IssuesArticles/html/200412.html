                This paper describes an in-depth usability evaluation of our ROADMAP road network extraction system. Six operators used ROADMAP in both manual and semi-automated modes, as well as BAE Systems’ SOCET SET®, to extract roads in four image test areas.An in-depth statistical analysis was performed on the timing results, with the main conclusion being that the performance differences among the three systems were not statistically significant. However, the evaluation highlighted a number of factors other than intrinsic feature extraction competence that affected the results and which point to the potential for significant engineering improvements.

                In this paper, a unique approach for road extraction utilizing pixel spectral information for classification and image segmentation-derived object features was developed. In this approach, road extraction was performed in two steps. In the first step, support vector machine (SVM) was employed merely to classify the image into two groups of categories: aroad groupand anon-road group.For this classification, support vector machine (SVM) achieved higher accuracy than Gaussian maximum likelihood (GML). In the second step, the road group image was segmented into geometrically homogeneous objects using a region growing technique based on a similarity criterion, with higher weighting on shape factors over spectral criteria. A simple thresholding on the shape index and density features derived from these objects was performed to extract road features, which were further processed by thinning and vectorization to obtain road centerlines. The experiment showed the proposed approach worked well with images comprised by both rural and urban area features.

                This paper presents a framework for extracting networks of linear features such as roads from imagery using an object-oriented geodata model. The proof of concept approach has resulted in the Automated Linear Feature Identification and Extraction (ALFIE) which uses a control strategy to automate the process flow. The resulting system is highly flexible, incorporating a toolkit of algorithms and imagery to extract linear features and utilizes contextual information to allow evidence of class membership to be built up from a variety of sources. The classification algorithm employs a Bayesian modelling approach. This incorporates both geometric and photometric information of which five key discriminators were identified: width, width variation, sinuosity, spectral value, and spectral value variation. This paper presents an in-depth discussion of the processes undertaken by the ALFIE system and quantitative results of the final output from the system in terms of classification accuracy and network completeness.

                The automated extraction of linear features from remotely sensed imagery has been the subject of extensive research over several decades. Recent studies show promise for extraction of feature information for applications such as updating geographic information systems (GIS). Research has been stimulated by the increase in available imagery in recent years following the launch of several airborne and satellite sensors. However, while the expansion in the range and availability of image data provides new possibilities for deriving image related products, it also places new demands on image processing. Efficiently dealing with the vast amount of available data necessitates an increase in automation, while still taking advantage of the skills of a human operator. This paper provides an overview of the types of imagery being used for linear feature extraction. The paper also describes methods used for feature extraction and considers quantitative and qualitative accuracy assessment of these procedures.

                In this paper, we present a semi-automatic road extraction method based on a piecewise parabola model with 0-order continuity. The piecewise parabola model is constructed by seed points coarsely placed by a human operator. In this case, road extraction actually becomes a physical problem of solving of each piece of parabola with only two or three unknown parameters by using image constraints. We have used a least square template matching to solve the parabola parameters. The template is deformable developed based on the automatic detection of dual road edges. In addition, a method of flexible observation weight evaluation has also been developed in this matching method. Extensive testing experiments on various image sets demonstrate that the method is able to extract road centerlines reliably. It offers much higher efficiency in contrast to manual digitizing process. We also discuss some issues about semiautomatic road extraction and future work for improving the reliability and extending the availability of our method.

                This article presents one solution to the parameterization problem for automated road feature extraction models. Using a line-length buffer approach, a measure of agreement between extracted road features and reference road features is defined. An automated approach for deriving this agreement index is presented and implemented as a parameterization model. Coupling the implemented parameterization model with an existing transportation feature extraction model is demonstrated. Although the solution was designed for a road feature extraction model (FEM), the conceptual design could be applied to other linear FEMs, such as models for streams, fault lines, and isolines.

                This work presents a novel methodology for fully automated road centerline extraction that exploits spectral content from high resolution multispectral images. Preliminary detection of candidate road centerline components is performed withAnti-parallel-edge Centerline Extraction (ACE). This is followed by constructing a road vector topology with a fuzzy grouping model that links nodes from a self-organized mapping of the ACE components. Following topology construction, aSelf-Supervised Road Classification (SSRC)feedback loop is implemented to automate the process of training sample selection and refinement for a road class, as well as deriving practical spectral definitions for non-road classes. SSRC demonstrates a potential to provide dramatic improvement in road extraction results by exploiting spectral content. Road centerline extraction results are presented for three 1 m color-infrared suburban scenes which show significant improvement following SSRC.

                This paper describes a semi-automatic algorithm for tracking road centerlines from satellite images at 1 m resolution. We assume that road centerlines are visible in the image and that among points on road centerlines similarity transformation holds. Previous approaches proposed for semi-automatic road extraction include energy minimization and template matching with global enforcement. In this paper we will show that least squares correlation matching alone can work for tracking road centerlines. Our algorithm works by defining a template around a user-given input point, which shall lie on a road centerline, and then by matching the template against the image along the orientation of the road under consideration. Once matching succeeds, new match proceeds by shifting a matched target window further along road orientation. By repeating the process above, we obtain a series of points, which lie on a road centerline successively. An Ikonos image over Seoul area was used for test. The algorithm could successfully extract road centerlines once valid input points were provided from a user. The contribution of this paper is that we proved template matching could offer wider applicability in feature extraction, and we designed a new template matching scheme that worked for feature extraction without global enforcements.

                This paper introduces a new wavelet transform based method of road centerline extraction from high resolution remote sensing images. In the one dimensional case, we characterize different kinds of sudden changes of signals by comparing the magnitudes of the local extreme values of the wavelet transforms under different dilation scales of the same wavelet. The platform-like signals, which come from cross sections of roads, can be characterized through the evolution of the wavelet transform across scales. A two-dimensional wavelet transform of an image consists of two components, each component is a one dimensional wavelet transform in one coordinate direction followed by a smoothing process in the perpendicular direction. The road edges can be characterized through the evolution of the two-dimensional wavelet transform across different scales. Edges of the main roads can then be extracted using these characterizations, and the road centerlines can be obtained by proper post-processing.

                This paper presents an automatic road extraction technique that combines information from aerial photos and laser scanning data (LSD). This innovative Road Extraction Assisted by Laser (REAL) can detect the road edges shadowed by surrounding high objects. A new concept of Associated Road Line (ARL) graph from LSD is introduced to enhance Real Road Line (RRL) graph from aerial photos. The extraction process consists of three steps: The first step is analysing laser images where parameters such as height and edges of high objects are obtained. Secondly, digital images are analysed where road edges are detected. It is evident that ARL and RRL graphs are homeomorphous which provides a theoretical foundation of REAL. The gaps of RRL are bridged through their ARL with a topological transformation. Finally, shadowed parts of RRL are reconstructed by a spline-approximation algorithm. The experimental results show that this approach is effective and has potential advantages.

                This paper evaluates the utility of various image processing methods for mapping smuggler trail networks crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. Very high spatial-resolution, digital, multispectral imagery was acquired in three visible and one near-infrared wavelength bands along the U.S.-Mexico border using an Airborne Data Acquisition and Registration (ADAR) digital camera system mounted on a helicopter. Four image enhancement methods and one neural-network based automated feature extraction technique were tested. Measures of trail length were compared with a ground-based GPS trail survey to evaluate accuracy.The optimal image enhancement method for trail mapping varied with topography and vegetation structure. The green vegetation component from spectral mixture analysis (SMA) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were most useful for enhancing trails for subsequent interactive visual interpretation and digitizing. The neural network feature extraction technique produced superior results when combined with interactive digitizing.

This paper focuses on the problem of quality when extracting roads from such data. The definition of a judicious reference enabling the establishment of quantitative criteria is proposed. A method is presented and two sets of criteria dedicated to the evaluation of road extraction algorithms are introduced. An example of an application is proposed enhancing the benefits of a rigorous approach of this problem.

                In general, automatic object extraction systems may not be expected to deliver absolutely perfect results, and thus, for meeting predefined application requirements, a human operator must inspect the automatically-obtained results. In order to speed up the time- and cost-intensive inspection, the system should provide the operator with confidence values characterizing its own performance. In practice, however, this is rarely the case. In this paper, we present general ideas on the methodology and representation of internal evaluation (self-diagnosis) within automatic object extraction systems. We illustrate their implementation into two different road extraction systems, and based on a test series of aerial images, we exemplify how results attached with confidence values can increase system efficiency for practical applications. To analyze the reliability of self-diagnosis, we matched the internally-evaluated results to a manually-plotted reference. The comparison shows the benefits but also some remaining deficiencies of the self-diagnosis tool.
