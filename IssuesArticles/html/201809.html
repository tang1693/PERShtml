                The vegetation water content (VWC) quantitative is useful for monitoring vegetation physiological growth. The relationship betweenVWCand vegetation water indices was analyzed. The optimal estimation model was established. The results show that: (1) Absorption bands primarily fell within 380 to 400 nm, 680 to 720 nm, 1420 to 1450 nm, 1900 to 1940 nm, and 2450 to 2500 nm; (2) comparing published vegetation water indices and developed vegetation indices, it showed that DVI(1712,1382), NDSI(2201,1870)and RSI(2259,1870)had a better correlation withVWCthan the published vegetation water; and (3) NDSI(2201,1870)and RSI(2259,1870)performed well in estimating vegetation water content, DVI(1712,1382)had a rough estimate of its water content. Moreover, the linear combination of DVI(1712,1382), NDSI(2201,1870)and RSI(2259,1870)improved the estimation ofVWC. The best vegetation indices for estimatingVWCwere found to be the linear combination of DVI(1712,1382), NDSI(2201,1870)andRSI(2259,1870)in arid area of northwestern China.

                This study investigated central urban area of Guangzhou as an example. Data on the types of land use in 2000-2009 and building data were used to analyze the changes in the intensity of urban heat island (UHI) by using the meteorological and numerical weather and research forecasting (WRF) model. The correlation analysis method was used to analyze the temperature and building density to explore the decisive influence of building density on theUHIeffect. Results showed that theWRFmodel can be used to simulate the temperature and humidity performance in theUHIeffects. Moreover, urban building density have a great coefficient withUHI. TheUHIeffect is relatively weak when a few buildings sparsely distributed, various building densities have a substantial influence on theUHIeffect. In general, urban development in Guangzhou has enhanced human activities and changed the type of land use, thereby considerably influencing theUHIeffect.

            A Long-Term, Consistent Land Cover History of the Southeastern United States

                Land-Cover/Land-Use (LCLU) change is a critical aspect of global environmental change, with profound social and ecological consequences. The southeastern U.S. in particular is changing rapidly, but a long-term, consistentLCLUhistory at fine spatial resolution does not exist for the region. Here, we present a newLCLUhistory of the southeastern U.S. based on temporal extension of the 2011 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) back to 1986. We used Automatic Adaptive Signature Generalization (AASG) to generate this product from Landsat TM/ETM+ imagery and ancillary topographic information. AASG identifies stable sites between two images and uses these stable sites to generate a new training dataset for updating a classification from one date to the next. Our long-termLCLUclassifications are broadly consistent with theNLCDwhile providing a much longer historical record for characterizing recent changes in the southeastern U.S. and contextualizing their consequences for ecosystem services in the region.

                Integration of satellite laser altimetry data and stereo images without ground control points (GCPs) is an attractive method for global mapping. In this paper, we propose a new strategy of integrating Ziyuan3-02 (ZY3-02) satellite stereo images and laser altimetry data using a rigorous sensor model (RSM) with laser ranging constraint under the synchronized and rational function model (RFM) with laser elevation constraint under the non-synchronized capture for high-accuracy mapping withoutGCPs. Four experimental regions in China are selected to validate the method. The results show that theZY3-02satellite laser altimetry data can be used to improve the elevation accuracy of stereo images to better than 3.0 m withoutGCPs. All of the conclusions are valuable for the development of China's next generation of surveying and mapping satellites.

                Videogrammetry is an extension to close-range photogrammetry which provides a convenient way to capture the three-dimensional (3D) dynamic response of moving objects in a non-contact manner. The performance of tracking in image sequence is crucial to the measurement accuracy. This paper proposes an improved subpixel phase correlation method for tracking in image sequence, which combines the advantages of gradient representation, robust plane fitting and robustness iteration. By the use of the proposed phase correlation based tracking method and other advanced image processing algorithms, a practical videogrammetric measurement system is presented to provide an alternative means to monitor and analyze 3D structural vibration deformations. Two simulated tests as well as one static test are performed to demonstrate the superiority and reliability of the proposed phase correlation method. The empirical experimental results of the monitoring of large-scale shaking table tests with a landslide dam model, including coordinate comparisons with the total station and acceleration comparisons with the original waveform and acceleration sensors, confirm the effectiveness of the videogrammetric measurement system based on the improved subpixel phase correlation method.
