                This paper presents a triangulation-based hierarchical image matching method for wide-baseline images. The method includes the following three steps: (a) image orientation by incorporating the SIFT algorithm with the RANSAC approach, (b) feature matching based on the self-adaptive triangle constraint, which includes point-to-point matching and subsequent point-to-area matching, and (c) triangulation constrained dense matching based on the previous matched results. Two new constraints, the triangulation-based disparity constraint and triangulation-based gradient orientation constraint, are developed to alleviate the matching ambiguity for wide-baseline images. A triangulation based affine-adaptive cross-correlation is developed to help find correct matches even in the image regions with large perspective distortions. Experiments using Mars ground wide-baseline images and terrestrial wide-baseline images revealed that the proposed method is capable of generating reliable and dense matching results for terrain mapping and surface reconstruction from the wide-baseline images.

                This study evaluated the effectiveness of using Thematic Mapper (TM) data for estimating soil organic carbon (SOC) content in the Zarqa Basin, Jordan, a typical semi-arid environment, and under natural surface conditions by testing a variety of statistical modeling techniques. This is essential for implementing carbon crediting programs for ameliorating the effects of global warming. Although none of the developed models was powerful in predicting SOC, a stepwise regression model was selected since it provided the lowest validation root mean square error (RMSE) of 10.4 metric tons per hectare (ton/ha). Using this model, a SOC map for the basin was constructed by applying map algebra. The total SOC content to 0.2 m depth of the basin was calculated to be 9,423,986.4 metric tons with SOC density of 26.3 ton/ha. This study suggested that, in semi-arid environments and using the statistical modeling techniques that were tested, TM-based SOC models cannot be used for implementing carbon crediting programs; however, they can estimate total surface SOC pools in large areas to within a few percent error.

            A Multidirectional and Multiscale Morphological Index for Automatic Building Extraction from Multispectral GeoEye-1 Imagery

                This study proposes a novel morphological building index (MBI) for automatic building extraction from high-resolution remotely sensed imagery. The basic idea of MBI is to build a relationship between the implicit characteristics of buildings (e.g., brightness, size, and contrast) and the properties of morphological operators (e.g., reconstruction, granulometry, and directionality). Buildings are extracted by performing a threshold on the MBI feature image. Subsequently, the shape features, such as area and length-width ratio, are used to refine the binary building map. In order to validate the proposed algorithm, a comparative study was performed between MBI, a recently developed texture-derived built-up presence index (PanTex), and the widely used object-based approach. Experiments were conducted on a multispectral GeoEye-1 image, covering a study area of 5.5 km by 5.3 km in Hongshan district of Wuhan, central China. In experiments, MBI achieved satisfactory results and outperformed other algorithms in terms of both accuracies and visual inspection. The effects of parameters of MBI were also analyzed in detail, including directions, sizes and the binaryzation threshold.

            A Support Vector Regression Approach to Estimate Forest Biophysical Parameters at the Object Level Using Airborne Lidar Transects and QuickBird Data

                A potential solution to reduce high acquisition costs for airborne lidar (light detection and ranging) data is to combine lidar transects and optical satellite imagery to characterize forest vertical structure. Although multiple regression is typically used for such modeling, it seldom fully captures the complex relationships between forest variables. In an effort to improve these relationships, this study investigated the potential of Support Vector Regression (SVR), a machine learning technique, to generalize (lidar-measured) forest canopy height from four lidar transects (representing 8.8 percent, 17.6 percent, 26.4 percent and 35.2 percent area of the site) to the entire study area using QuickBird imagery. The best estimated canopy height was then linked with field measurements to predict actual canopy height, above-ground biomass (AGB) and volume. GEOgraphic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) was used to generate all estimates at a small tree/cluster level with a mean object size (MOS) of 0.04 ha for conifer and deciduous trees. Results show that for all lidar transect samples, SVR models achieved better performance for estimating canopy height than multiple regression. By using SVR and a single lidar transect (i.e., 8.8 percent of the study area), the following relationships were found between predicted and field-measured canopy height (R2: 0.81; RMSE: 4.0 m), AGB (R2: 0.76; RMSE: 63.1 Mg/ha) and volume (R2: 0.64; RMSE: 156.9 m3/ha).

                A method is presented for the co-registration of overlapping elevation surfaces based on local slope analysis. Comparison and statistical analysis of local slope versus local elevation difference between overlapping surfaces allows for the estimation of both vertical and horizontal offsets between the two surfaces. This method is then used to re-align the flightlines of a Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) dataset collected in southern Idaho resulting in a dataset with significantly higher accuracy than the original. The relative horizontal accuracy is doubled, with a final value of approximately 25 to 30 cm, while the relative vertical accuracy is improved by several centimeters to a final value of approximately 6 to 7 cm.
