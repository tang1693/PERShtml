                The system calibration determines the position and orientation between the sensor and the navigation systems, such as boresight misalignment. Although there is much research about boresight calibration, there are not sufficient studies on the frequency of the calibration performance. The short-term stability of boresight misalignment was investigated in previous studies, but long-term stability research could not be done. It is important to emphasize that long-term stability is still open to questions. In this study, an Ultracam Eagle digital aerial camera's data from 2012 to 2016 were analyzed and the question of how often calibration should be performed was investigated. Boresight misalignment does not remain constant on a yearly basis and should be calibrated every year before the flight season. It was observed that the boresight misalignment changed dramatically when the inertial measurement unit or camera was removed from the aircraft and sent to the manufacturer for factory calibration.

                Unlike traditional remote sensing inversion, this study proposes a new distribution–distribution scheme, which uses statistical inferences to estimate the probability distribution of in-water components based on the probability distribution of the observed spectra. The distribution–distribution scheme has the advantages that it rapidly gives the statistical information of the water of interest, assists the traditional scheme in improving models, and provides more valuable information for water classification and aquatic environment analysis. In this study, based on Landsat-8 images, we analyzed the spectral probability distributions of 688 global waters and found that many of them were normal, log normal, and exponential distributions with diverse patterns in distribution parameters such as the mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Using simulated and field-measured data, we propose a bootstrap-based distribution–distribution scheme and develop some simple remote sensing statistical inference models to estimate the distribution parameters of yellow substance in water.

                Due to its high ranging accuracy, spaceborne laser altimetry technology can improve the accuracy of satellite stereo mapping without ground control points. In the past, full-waveformICE,CLOUD, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) laser altimeter data have been used as one of the main data sources for global elevation control. As a second-generation satellite,ICESat-2is equipped with an altimeter using photon counting mode. This can further improve the application capability for stereo mapping because of the six laser beams with high along-track repetition frequency, which can provide more detailed ground contour descriptions. Previous studies have addressed how to extract high-accuracy elevation control points fromICESatdata. However, these methods cannot be directly applied toICESat-2data because of the different modes of the laser altimeters. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method using comprehensive evaluation labels that can extract high-accuracy elevation control points that meet the different level elevation accuracy requirements for large scale mapping from theICESat-2land-vegetation along-track product. The method was verified using two airborne lidar data sets. In flat, hilly, and mountainous areas, by using our method to extract the terrain elevation, the root-mean-square error of elevation control points decrease from 1.249–2.094 m, 2.237–3.225 m, and 2.791–4.822 m to 0.262–0.429 m, 0.484–0.596 m, and 0.611–1.003 m, respectively. The results show that the extraction elevations meet the required accuracy for large scale mapping.

            Diffuse Attenuation Coefficient (Kd) fromICESat-2ATLAS Spaceborne Lidar Using Random-Forest Regression

                This study investigates a new method for measuring water turbidity—specifically, the diffuse attenuation coefficient of downwelling irradiance Kd —using data from a spaceborne, green-wavelength lidar aboard the National Aeronautics and Space Administration'sICESat-2satellite. The method enables us to fill nearshore data voids in existing Kd data sets and provides a more direct measurement approach than methods based on passive multispectral satellite imagery. Furthermore, in contrast to other lidar-based methods, it does not rely on extensive signal processing or the availability of the system impulse response function, and it is designed to be applied globally rather than at a specific geographic location. The model was tested using Kd measurements from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite sensor at 94 coastal sites spanning the globe, with Kd values ranging from 0.05 to 3.6 m –1 . The results demonstrate the efficacy of the approach and serve as a benchmark for future machine-learning regression studies of turbidity usingICESat-2.

                In this article, margin theory is exploited to design better ensemble classifiers for remote sensing data. A semi-supervised version of the ensemble margin is at the core of this work. Some major challenges in ensemble learning are investigated using this paradigm in the difficult context of land cover classification: selecting the most informative instances to form an appropriate training set, and selecting the best ensemble members. The main contribution of this work lies in the explicit use of the ensemble margin as a decision method to select training data and base classifiers in an ensemble learning framework. The selection of training data is achieved through an innovative iterative guided bagging algorithm exploiting low-margin instances. The overall classification accuracy is improved by up to 3%, with more dramatic improvement in per-class accuracy (up to 12%). The selection of ensemble base classifiers is achieved by an ordering-based ensemble-selection algorithm relying on an original margin-based criterion that also targets low-margin instances. This method reduces the complexity (ensemble size under 30) but maintains performance.

                The continuous monitoring of land surface movement over time is of paramount importance for assessing landslide triggering factors and mitigating landslide hazards. This research focuses on measuring horizontal and vertical surface displacement due to a devastating landslide event in the west-facing slope of the Rajamala Hills, induced by intense rainfall. The landslide occurred in Pettimudi, a tea-plantation village of the Idukki district in Kerala, India, on August 6–7, 2020. The persistent-scatterer synthetic aperture radar interferometry (PSInSAR ) technique, along with the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS), was applied to investigate the land surface movement over time. A stack of 20 Sentinel-1A single-look complex images (19 interferograms) acquired in descending passes was used for PSInSAR processing. The line-of-sight (LOS ) displacement in long time series, and hence the average LOS velocity, was measured at each measurement-point location. The mean LOS velocity was decomposed into horizontal east–west (EW ) and vertical up–down velocity components. The results show that the mean LOS, EW, and up–down velocities in the study area, respectively, range from –18.76 to +11.88, –10.95 to +6.93, and –15.05 to +9.53 mm/y, and the LOS displacement ranges from –19.60 to +19.59 mm. The displacement values clearly indicate the instability of the terrain. The time-series LOS displacement trends derived from the applied PSInSAR technique are very useful for providing valuable inputs for disaster management and the development of disaster early-warning systems for the benefit of local residents.
