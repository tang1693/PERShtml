                The geolocation accuracy of satellite laser altimeters is significantly influenced by on-orbit misalignment and ranging biases. Few researchers have investigated the weight matrix determination method, which plays a critical role in bias estimation. In this article, a systematic misalignment and ranging bias model was deduced. Based on the least squares criterion, a bias calibration method was designed for use with solid natural surfaces; and the weight matrix was defined according to the ranging uncertainty theory. Referring to the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) parameters, the established model and method were verified using programming simulations, which indicated with a misalignment of tens of arcseconds in the pitch and roll directions and a ranging bias of several centimeters, by using the weight matrix, the estimation accuracies of the misalignment and ranging bias increased by 0.22 and 2 cm, respectively. Consequently, the geolocation accuracy increased by approximately 0.64 m horizontally and 3 cm vertically for a 1Â° sloping surface.

                Spatially explicit modeling of recovering forest structure within two years following wildfire disturbance has not been attempted, yet such knowledge is critical for determining successional pathways. We used remote sensing and field data, along with digital climate and terrain data, to model and map early-seral aspen structure and vegetation species richness following wildfire. Richness was the strongest model (RMSE= 2.47 species, Adj. R2= 0.60), followed by aspen stem diameter, basal area (BA), height, density, and percent cover (Adj. R2range = 0.22 to 0.53). Effects of pre-fire aspenBAand fire severity on post-fire aspen structure and richness were analyzed. Post-fire recovery attributes were not significantly related to fire severity, while all but percent cover and richness were sensitive to pre-fire aspenBA(Adj. R2range = 0.12 to 0.33, p <0.001). This remote mapping capability will enable improved prediction of future forest composition and structure, and associated carbon stocks.

                Robust image registration is a vital challenging task, especially for multi-source satellite images that may have significant different illumination. A coarse-to-fine registration algorithm based on phase information is proposed. The coarse registration is implemented using Fourier-polar transform and phase correction based on phase congruency. The fine registration is first implemented by dividing large images into blocks. Then, the uniformly distributed corners and Principal Phase Congruency (PPC) images are extracted. After that, the corresponding points of extracted corners are obtained based on Phase Correlation of Principal Phase Congruency (PCPPC), followed by a new outlier removal method. Experiment results revealed the robustness, accuracy, and distribution quality less than 1.0 of the proposed algorithm. The matching correct rate is about 94.7 percent for Data Set 2 due to considerable topography variations, and more than 96.6 percent for data set 4 despite significant different or inverse intensity, which can reach 100 percent with our outlier removal method.

                UAV-based 3D reconstruction has been used in various applications. However, mitigating the impact of outliers in automatically matched points remains to be a challenging task. Assuming the availability of prior information regarding theUAVtrajectory, this paper presents two approaches for reliable estimation of Relative Orientation Parameters (ROPs) in the presence of high percentage of matching outliers. The first approach, which assumes that theUAVplatform is moving at a constant flying height while maintaining the camera in a nadir-looking orientation, provides a two-point closed-form solution. The second approach starts from prior information regarding the flight trajectory to define a linearized model, which is augmented with a built-in outlier removal procedure, to estimate a refined set ofROPs. Experimental results from real datasets demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approaches in providing reliableROPsfromUAV-based imagery in the presence of a high percentage of matching outliers (up to 90 percent).

                Owing to the large biases of laboratory-calibrated imaging parameters, the initial direct georeferencing accuracy of Ziyuan-3 (ZY-3) three-line camera (TLC) images can only reach the kilometer level. In this paper, a line-based geometric calibration model is established by using the line-coplanarity constraint, and a feasible geometric calibration approach for theZY-3 TLCs using ground control lines (GCLs) is presented. Experimental results show that the calibration accuracy achieved by usingGCLsreached about 1.0 pixel, which was almost the same as that achieved by using ground control points (GCPs). After substitutingGCLsforGCPsin the geometric calibration, the georeferencing accuracy of theZY-3 TLCimages without ground controls was significantly improved from the kilometer level to better than 11 m in planimetry and 8 m in height. A better georeferencing accuracy of about 3.0 m in planimetry and 2.5 m in height was achieved after the block adjustment with fourGCPs.
