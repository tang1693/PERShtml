                Very large three-dimensional (3D) point datasets are increasingly common, such as from Light Detection and Ranging (lidar). Increasingly, there are attempts to exploit these 3D point data sets beyond mere visualization. However, current Spatial Information Systems provide only limited 3D support. Even commercial systems advertising in-built, 3D data types provide only minimal functionality. Specifically, there is no effective means of indexing large 3D point datasets, which is crucial for efficient analysis and engineering use. Also, many datasets are information rich (e.g., contain color or some other associated semantic information), which has yet to be fully exploited. This paper presents the implementation in a commercial spatial database of a spatial indexing technique using an octree data structure and highlights its advantages for sparse, as well as uniformly distributed, aerial lidar data. The implementation outperforms an existing r-tree index within the software, and offers additional functionality of attributebased 3D grouping.

                Estimation of soil loss using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) has long been an active research topic, but its application in a large area is a challenge due to data availability and quality. In this study, the RUSLE model was used to evaluate soil erosion risk based on soil samples, a soil type map, digital elevation model (DEM) data, and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify major factors influencing soil erosion risks. A regression model based on DEM-derived slope gradient and TM-derived fractional soil and vegetation images was developed to map soil erosion risk distribution in a forest ecosystem in Zhejiang, China. The developed method has the potential to quickly examine spatial distribution of soil erosion risks. This study provides a new insight for evaluating soil erosion risks in forest ecosystems with the integration of remote sensing and GIS.

            A Variational Gradient-based Fusion Method for Visible and SWIR Imagery

                This paper presents a new variational gradient-based fusion method for visible and short-wave infrared (SWIR) imagery. The proposed method enables spatial enhancement and dehazing of visible imagery. Integrating gradients from SWIR imagery into visible imagery produces a single image with true color and sharp gradients. A constraint based on band correlation is included to improve the enhancement and implement dehazing. The band correlation is according to the quantitative relationship between the wavelength and the atmospheric effect caused by Rayleigh scattering. In this study, both clear and hazy Landsat ETM[H11001] images are used in the experiments. By visual assessment, the gradient of the fused image is more salient than that of the original image, and the true color is well preserved. With the inclusion of the band correlation constraint, the proposed fusion method yields almost haze-free results. Quantitatively, the Metric Q of the fused images is significantly higher than that of the original images; the largest increase of the Metric Q in the experimental results is from 0.0114 to 0.0611. Moreover, for the results of the proposed method, the Metric Q increase in the visible bands declines from blue band to red band.

                The usefulness and acceptance of geo-information systems are mainly depends on the quality of the underlying geo-data. This paper describes a novel system for semi-automatic quality control of existing topographic geo-spatial data via automatic image analysis. The goal is to reduce the manual effort for quality control of a GIS database to a minimum. The core of the system is a semantic network in which different image analysis operators can be included. The image analysis operators are created for specific applications, i.e., the quality control of specific object classes which are most relevant. Images which can be used in the system are aerial images, high-resolution satellite imagery, and low-resolution satellite imagery. A prototype of the system has been in use for several years at public mapping organizations. From the experience gained during this time, we give a detailed report on the system performance and an evaluation of the results.

            Topographic Corrections of Satellite Data for Regional Monitoring

                The increased availability of satellite imagery has made regional monitoring programs possible. To compare images taken at different times, variation in reflectance caused by the interaction of sun position and topography must be corrected. Previous studies of topographic correction methods have often used only single scenes taken under good conditions, and even then have found mixed effects. Six correction methods were tested on two Landsat scenes (TM and ETM +) in central Pennsylvania obtained at low, medium, and high solar elevations. The effects of the corrections on band reflectance values and two ratio-based vegetation indices were assessed. Lambertian methods should not be used for regional monitoring of vegetation: these corrections are not band-specific, and thus do not remove topographic effects on vegetation indices. Instead, non-Lambertian methods such as the c-correction or Minnaert methods, particularly cover-based modifications of the latter, should be used. No methods provide effective correction under conditions of low or negative illumination, though such conditions are often found. An integrated approach including atmospheric corrections may offer a way to reduce topographic effects even at low illumination.

            Bundle Block Adjustment of Weakly Connected Aerial Imagery

                In aerial photogrammetry of island and reef areas, traditional aerial triangulation cannot be performed because many images in the block are partially or even completely covered by water, and thus there are not enough tie points among adjacent images. To solve this problem, an effective algorithm of position and orientation system (POS) integrated bundle block adjustment is proposed. The exterior orientation parameters of each image are modeled as functions of corresponding POS observations and their estimated systematic errors. A POS integrated bundle adjustment model is designed with the purpose of effectively eliminating the systematic errors of inertial measurement unit observations. Experimental results of three sets of island aerial images show that the proposed approach can compensate for the systematic errors of POS observations effectively. The topo-graphic mapping requirements of hilly terrain at 1:2 000 scale can be fulfilled, provided that at least one ground control point is used in the bundle adjustment.

            Objects-based Image Analysis for Mapping Natura 2000 Habitats to Improve Forest Management

                Natura 2000 is a European network of protected areas established under the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC). According to the Habitats Directive, habitat maps must be periodically updated, which requires the development of cost- and time-efficient mapping practices. In this study, we propose a methodology for habitat mapping using very high spatial resolution (QuickBird) images with Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA). We classified five segmentation levels: level 5 incorporated the prior knowledge of the study area into the analysis; level 4 and 1 were used to identify arable areas and land covers, respectively. The information contained in levels 1, 4, and 5 was then combined to classify plant species in level 2. Finally, habitats were classified in level 3 using level 2 class-related features. The habitat map obtained had an overall accuracy of 86.3 percent. Classification accuracies were higher for tree-and pasture-dominated habitats than for shrub-dominated habitats.
