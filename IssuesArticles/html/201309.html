                There are many spectral bands or band functions developed for land-cover feature measurements. When the ratio of the number of training samples to the number of feature measurements is small, the traditional land-cover classification is not accurate. To solve this problem, a decision-theoretic rough set model (DTRSM) is first introduced. This model is linked with distinguishing different types of samples in the image. The samples in the minority classes will be misclassified based on the model. To minimize the misclassification, we propose an improved feature selection algorithm with comprehensive criteria. This algorithm is implemented on the Landsat TM data covering two disparate regions which are Lake Baiyangdian and Qingpu District in Shanghai located in the north and south of China, respectively. We compare the algorithm with other feature selection algorithms. Results show that the proposed method can effectively select key features for different data sets and the accuracy of classifiers can be ensured.

                Land managers need to rapidly assess vegetation composition and bare ground to effectively evaluate and manage shrub steppe communities that have been encroached by pinyon and juniper trees. We used an object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach to estimate land cover classes found in pinyon-juniper woodlands, and evaluated the relationship between ground measurements and OBIA land cover measurements. We acquired high-spatial resolution color-infrared imagery for five sites with a Vexcel UltraCamX digital camera in June 2009. We simultaneously collected ground-based cover measurements within 30 m × 33 m subplots. OBIA mean land cover class differences by site ranged from underestimating litter by 3 percent to overestimating live trees by 1 percent when compared to ground-based measurements. Overall accuracy for thematic maps was 84 percent with a Kappa statistic of 0.80. Although OBIA cover estimates varied slightly from ground cover estimates, methods provide land managers with options for prioritizing management practices and enabling monitoring at an operational scale.

                This study proposed a new method to predict residential property value using remote sensing data as a major data source substitute to traditional inputs in house price estimation models. An optimized regional regression (ORR) approach was proposed in this study. This approach integrated a differential evolution optimization algorithm along with the ordinary least square regression to improve house value prediction accuracy. In addition to ORR, four other regression methods, random forest, Cubist regression trees, geographically weighted regression, and global ordinary least square, were also employed to provide a comparison. Results showed that models using remote sensing data are capable of acquiring accurate house price information. In addition, the volume of residential buildings proved to be an efficient substitute for total living area, the most important variable of the house price estimation model (i.e., a hedonic model). The ORR approach yielded the most accurate predictions followed by the geographically weighted regression. Further investigation indicated that the ORR approach has three major advantages: it is effective, stable, and the results are readily interpretable.

            Point-based Classification of Power Line Corridor Scene Using Random Forests

                The power line network, interconnecting power generation facilities and their end-users, is a critical infrastructure on which most of our socio-economic activities rely. As society becomes increasingly reliant on electricity, the rapid and effective monitoring of power line safety is critical. In particular, accurately knowing the current geometric and thermal status of power lines and identifying possible encroachments is the most important task in the power line risk management process. To facilitate this task, the correct identification of key objects comprising a power line corridor scene from remotely sensed data is the first important step. In recent years, airborne lidar has been successfully adopted as a cost-effective and accurate data source for mapping the power line corridors. However, in today’s practice, the classification of power line objects using lidar data still relies on labor-intensive data manipulation, and its automation is urgently required. To address this problem, this paper proposes a point-based supervised classification method, which enables the identification of five utility corridor objects (wires, pylons, vegetation, buildings, and low objects) using airborne lidar data. A total of 21 features were investigated to illustrate the horizontal and vertical properties of power line objects. A non-parametric discriminative classifier, Random Forests model, was trained with refined features to label raw laser point clouds. The proposed classifier showed 91.04 percent sample-weighted and 90.07 percent class-weighted classification accuracy, which indicates it could be highly valuable for large-scale, rapid compilations of corridor maps. A sensitivity analysis of the proposed classifier suggested that when compared, training with class-balanced samples improves classification performance over training with unbalanced samples, particularly with corridor objects such as wires and pylons.

            A Random Set Approach for Modeling Integrated Uncertainties of Traffic Islands Derived from Airborne Laser Scanning Points

                Traffic islands play a major role in transport studies by affecting traffic behavior safety, air pollution, and transport decision support. Point data obtained by laser scanning enable the determination of their locations. Planimetric errors, vertical errors, and limited point spacing however affect their spatial data quality (SDQ). In this study, we defined uncertainty as the lack of accuracy and analyzed its importance by modeling each traffic island as a random set. The covering functions of the point data and their intermediate locations were determined by point segmentation, followed by interpolation. In this way, traffic islands were delineated from the background with a transition zone. The study showed that point spacing has the largest contribution to the positonal accuracy of a traffic island. The area of the transition zone has a linear relation with the planimetric errors, whereas the influence of the vertical errors on the accuracy decreases with increasing point spacing. Experiments were conducted to investigate the influences of the parameters in an SDQ analysis. The study demonstrated how different sources of uncertainty can be integrated. Results showed the advantages of using random sets for SDQ modelling. We concluded that modelling of traffic islands by random sets provides meaningful information to integrate uncertainties.

            Assessing the Performance of Linear Feature Models

                A methodology for judging the performance of simulation models that involve linear features is presented taking as its test case a model that produces logging road networks. The approach combines existing methods of accuracy assessment, based on the so-called epsilon band, with the principle of statistical inference. This requires adapting neutral models from landscape ecology to generate a bootstrapped probability distribution reflecting the probabilistic characteristics of stochastic networks. The distribution is then used for inferential hypothesis testing, taking as its “null” hypothesis that a network has been produced randomly. The assessment methodology is used to evaluate the road network simulation model under six different parameterizations. Results are compared to findings obtained by the use of fuzzy similarity metrics. The paper argues that the epsilon band method provides confi-dence that model performance departs significantly from a randomized process, and that conclusions are free of at least one class of spurious results.
