                We describe a method for indexing and retrieving high-resolution image regions in large geospatial data libraries. An automated feature extraction method is used that generates a unique and specific structural description of each segment of a tessellated input image file. These tessellated regions are then merged into similar groups, or sub-regions, and indexed to provide flexible and varied retrieval in a query-by-example environment. The methods of tessellation, feature extraction, sub-region clustering, indexing, and retrieval are described and demonstrated using a geospatial library representing a 153 km2region of land in East Tennessee at 0.5 m per pixel resolution.

                This paper proposes a new algorithm for extracting building lines from monoscopic high-resolution satellite images. We focus on extracting lines from rectangular-shaped building roofs with a relatively large size. We achieve this task by devising a unique approach using line voting and matching. Our algorithm works as follows. An input point on a building roof is given manually. A region of interest is defined centered on the input point and within the region lines extracted. Then, a line voting process is applied to estimate initial orientation and position of a building line. The orientation and position are refined by a least squares matching process. We assessed the performance of our algorithm against two Ikonos images. Our algorithm extracted building lines from over 83 percent of buildings tested with average angular accuracy of one or two degrees and average positional accuracy of approximately one pixel. This result supports the algorithm proposed in this paper. The major contribution of this paper is that we provided an alternative way to line grouping approaches when edge responses from buildings are not strong enough.

                Mapping of the Earth’s surface from satellite images is a continuing application in remote sensing, which has been distinctly pushed with the increasing availability of very high-resolution image data. In most of the missions, stereo images can be acquired making 3D mapping from space very attractive, as high accuracy and level of detail become feasible from such data. In this paper, several case studies are presented, which have been applied to stereo pairs acquired by the SPOT sensors as well as the very high-resolution Ikonos sensor. As an extension to standard stereo mapping, a 3D mapping approach which makes use of multiple image coverage is presented. For this work, image triplets including multi-sensor data sets have been used to extract 3D topography information and to generate digital surface models. The benefit of this extended approach is comparatively assessed with respect to results achieved from standard stereo mapping.

                The main topic of this paper is high-resolution image fusion. The techniques used to merge high spatial resolution panchromatic images with high spectral resolution multispectral images are described. The most commonly used image fusion methods that work on the principle of component substitution (intensity-hue-saturation method (IHS), Brovey transform (BT), and multiplicative method (MULTI)) have been applied to Ikonos, QuickBird, Landsat, and aerial orthophoto images. Visual comparison, histogram analyses, correlation coefficients, and difference images were used in order to analyze the spectral and spatial qualities of the fused images. It was discovered that for preserving spectral characteristics, one needs a high level of similarity between the panchromatic image and the respective multispectral intensity. In order to achieve this, spectral sensitivity of multispectral and panchromatic data was performed, and digital values in individual bands have been modified before fusion. It has also been determined that spatial resolution is best preserved in the event of an unchanged input panchromatic image.

                In this paper, we compare the geometrical performance between the rigorous sensor model (RSM) and rational function model (RFM) in the sensor modeling of FORMOSAT-2 satellite images. For theRSM, we provide a least squares collocation procedure to determine the precise orbits. As for the RFM, we analyze the model errors when a large amount of quasi-control points, which are derived from the satellite ephemeris and attitude data, are employed. The model errors with respect to the length of the image strip are also demonstrated. Experimental results show that the RFM is well behaved, indicating that its positioning errors is similar to that of the RSM.

                Increasing demands on the accuracy and thematic resolution of vegetation community maps from remote sensing imagery has created a need for novel image analysis techniques. We present a case study for vegetation mapping of the Lake Tahoe Basin which fulfills many of the requirements of the Federal Geographic Data Committee base-level mapping (FGDC, 1997) by using hyperspatial Ikonos imagery analyzed with a fusion of pixel-based species classification, automated image segmentation techniques to define vegetation patch boundaries, and vegetation community classification using querying of the species classification raster based on existing and novel rulesets. This technique led to accurate FGDC physiognomic classes. Floristic classes such as dominance type remain somewhat problematic due to inaccurate species classification results. Vegetation, tree and shrub cover estimates (FGDC required attributes) were determined accurately. We discuss strategies and challenges to vegetation community mapping in the context of standards currently being advanced for thematic attributes and accuracy requirements.

                This work presents a multiresolution framework for merging a multispectral image having an arbitrary number of bands with a higher-resolution panchromatic observation. The fusion method relies on the generalized Laplacian pyramid (GLP), which is a multiscale, oversampled structure. The goal is to selectively perform injection of spatial frequencies from an image to another with the constraint of thoroughly retaining the spectral information of the coarser data. The novel idea is that a model of the modulation transfer functions (MTF) of the multispectral scanner is exploited to design the GLP reduction filter. Thus, the interband structure model (IBSM), which is calculated at the coarser scale, where both MS and PAN data are available, can be extended to the finer scale, without the drawback of the poor enhancement occurring when MTFs are assumed to be ideal filters. Experiments carried out on QuickBird data demonstrate that a superior spatial enhancement, besides the spectral quality typical of injection methods, is achieved by means of the MTF-adjusted fusion.

            Comparison of 3D Physical and Empirical Models for Generating DSMs from Stereo HR Images

                This research study addressed and compared 3D physical and empirical models for stereo-processing and the generation of digital surface models (DSMs) from different stereo high-resolution (HR) sensors (Ikonos and QuickBird). The 3D physical model is Toutin’s Model (TM) developed at the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, and the empirical model is the rational function model (RFM). The study also evaluated the conditions of experimentation to appropriately use these 3D models. The first results on stereo-bundle adjustments demonstrated that TM and vendor-supplied RFMs gave similar results with Ikonos as soon as RFM was refined with a shift computed from one GCP. On the other hand, TM gave better results than vendor-supplied RFMs with QuickBird regardless of the polynomial order and the number of GCPs. Due to its relief dependency, QuickBird RFM needed to be refined at least with linear functions computed from at least 6 to 10 GCPs. Some large errors were, however, noted on forward image RFM in column. The DSMs were then generated using an intensity matching approach and compared to 0.2 m accurate lidar elevation data. Because DSMs included the height of land-cover (trees, houses), elevation linear errors with 90 percent confidence level (LE90) were computed and compared for the entire area and three land-cover classes (forests, urban/residential, bare surfaces). TM and vendor-supplied RFMs with Ikonos, regardless of the method and GCP number, achieved comparable results for all classes, while TM achieved overall better results than vendor-supplied RFMs with QuickBird. All results demonstrated the necessity of refining Ikonos RFM with a shift and one GCP only and QuickBird RFM with 1st-order linear functions and 6 to 10 GCPs due to its relief dependency.

                Mapping of the Earth’s surface from satellite images is a continuing application in remote sensing, which has been distinctly pushed with the increasing availability of very high-resolution image data. In most of the missions, stereo images can be acquired making 3D mapping from space very attractive, as high accuracy and level of detail become feasible from such data. In this paper, several case studies are presented, which have been applied to stereo pairs acquired by the SPOT sensors as well as the very high-resolution Ikonos sensor. As an extension to standard stereo mapping, a 3D mapping approach which makes use of multiple image coverage is presented. For this work, image triplets including multi-sensor data sets have been used to extract 3D topography information and to generate digital surface models. The benefit of this extended approach is comparatively assessed with respect to results achieved from standard stereo mapping.

                The main topic of this paper is high-resolution image fusion. The techniques used to merge high spatial resolution panchromatic images with high spectral resolution multispectral images are described. The most commonly used image fusion methods that work on the principle of component substitution (intensity-hue-saturation method (IHS), Brovey transform (BT), and multiplicative method (MULTI)) have been applied to Ikonos, QuickBird, Landsat, and aerial orthophoto images. Visual comparison, histogram analyses, correlation coefficients, and difference images were used in order to analyze the spectral and spatial qualities of the fused images. It was discovered that for preserving spectral characteristics, one needs a high level of similarity between the panchromatic image and the respective multispectral intensity. In order to achieve this, spectral sensitivity of multispectral and panchromatic data was performed, and digital values in individual bands have been modified before fusion. It has also been determined that spatial resolution is best preserved in the event of an unchanged input panchromatic image.

                In this paper, we compare the geometrical performance between the rigorous sensor model (RSM) and rational function model (RFM) in the sensor modeling of FORMOSAT-2 satellite images. For theRSM, we provide a least squares collocation procedure to determine the precise orbits. As for the RFM, we analyze the model errors when a large amount of quasi-control points, which are derived from the satellite ephemeris and attitude data, are employed. The model errors with respect to the length of the image strip are also demonstrated. Experimental results show that the RFM is well behaved, indicating that its positioning errors is similar to that of the RSM.

                Increasing demands on the accuracy and thematic resolution of vegetation community maps from remote sensing imagery has created a need for novel image analysis techniques. We present a case study for vegetation mapping of the Lake Tahoe Basin which fulfills many of the requirements of the Federal Geographic Data Committee base-level mapping (FGDC, 1997) by using hyperspatial Ikonos imagery analyzed with a fusion of pixel-based species classification, automated image segmentation techniques to define vegetation patch boundaries, and vegetation community classification using querying of the species classification raster based on existing and novel rulesets. This technique led to accurate FGDC physiognomic classes. Floristic classes such as dominance type remain somewhat problematic due to inaccurate species classification results. Vegetation, tree and shrub cover estimates (FGDC required attributes) were determined accurately. We discuss strategies and challenges to vegetation community mapping in the context of standards currently being advanced for thematic attributes and accuracy requirements.

                This work presents a multiresolution framework for merging a multispectral image having an arbitrary number of bands with a higher-resolution panchromatic observation. The fusion method relies on the generalized Laplacian pyramid (GLP), which is a multiscale, oversampled structure. The goal is to selectively perform injection of spatial frequencies from an image to another with the constraint of thoroughly retaining the spectral information of the coarser data. The novel idea is that a model of the modulation transfer functions (MTF) of the multispectral scanner is exploited to design the GLP reduction filter. Thus, the interband structure model (IBSM), which is calculated at the coarser scale, where both MS and PAN data are available, can be extended to the finer scale, without the drawback of the poor enhancement occurring when MTFs are assumed to be ideal filters. Experiments carried out on QuickBird data demonstrate that a superior spatial enhancement, besides the spectral quality typical of injection methods, is achieved by means of the MTF-adjusted fusion.

            Comparison of 3D Physical and Empirical Models for Generating DSMs from Stereo HR Images

                This research study addressed and compared 3D physical and empirical models for stereo-processing and the generation of digital surface models (DSMs) from different stereo high-resolution (HR) sensors (Ikonos and QuickBird). The 3D physical model is Toutin’s Model (TM) developed at the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, and the empirical model is the rational function model (RFM). The study also evaluated the conditions of experimentation to appropriately use these 3D models. The first results on stereo-bundle adjustments demonstrated that TM and vendor-supplied RFMs gave similar results with Ikonos as soon as RFM was refined with a shift computed from one GCP. On the other hand, TM gave better results than vendor-supplied RFMs with QuickBird regardless of the polynomial order and the number of GCPs. Due to its relief dependency, QuickBird RFM needed to be refined at least with linear functions computed from at least 6 to 10 GCPs. Some large errors were, however, noted on forward image RFM in column. The DSMs were then generated using an intensity matching approach and compared to 0.2 m accurate lidar elevation data. Because DSMs included the height of land-cover (trees, houses), elevation linear errors with 90 percent confidence level (LE90) were computed and compared for the entire area and three land-cover classes (forests, urban/residential, bare surfaces). TM and vendor-supplied RFMs with Ikonos, regardless of the method and GCP number, achieved comparable results for all classes, while TM achieved overall better results than vendor-supplied RFMs with QuickBird. All results demonstrated the necessity of refining Ikonos RFM with a shift and one GCP only and QuickBird RFM with 1st-order linear functions and 6 to 10 GCPs due to its relief dependency.
