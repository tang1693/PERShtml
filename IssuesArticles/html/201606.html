                Random forests as a promising ensemble learning algorithm have been increasingly used for remote sensor image classification, and are found to perform identical or better than some popular classifiers. With only two algorithmic parameters, they are relatively easier to implement. Existing literature suggests that the performance of random forests is insensitive to changing algorithmic parameters. However, this was largely based on the classifier's accuracy that does not necessarily represent the resulting thematic map accuracy. The current study extends beyond the classifier's accuracy assessment and investigate how the algorithmic parameters could affect the resulting thematic map accuracy by random forests. A set of random forest models with different parameter settings was carefully constructed and then used to classify a satellite image into multiple land cover categories. Both the classifier's accuracy and the map accuracy were assessed. The results reveal that these parameters can affect the map accuracy up to 9 ∼16 percent for some classes, although their impact on the classifier's accuracy was quite limited. A careful parameterization prioritizing thematic map accuracy can help improve the performance of random forests in image classification, especially for spectrally complex land cover classes. These findings can help establish practical guidance on the use of random forests in the remote sensing community.

            A Statistical Examination of Image Stitching Software Packages For Use With Unmanned Aerial Systems

                There is growing demand for the collection of ultra-high spatial resolution imagery, such as is collected using unmanned aerial systems (UAS). Traditional methods of aerial photogrammetry are often difficult or time consuming to utilize due to the lack of sufficiently accurate ancillary information. The goal of this study was to compare geometric accuracy, visual quality, and price of three commonly available mosaicking software packages which offer a highly automated alternative to traditional methods: Photoscan Pro, Pix4D Pro Mapper, and Microsoft Image Composite Editor (ICE). A total of 223 images with a spatial resolution of 1.26 cm were collected by a UAS along with 70 ground control points. Microsoft Image Composite Editor had significantly fewer visual errors (Chi Square, p < .001), but it had the poorest geometric accuracy with a RMSE of 34.7 cm (Tukey-Kramer, p < 0.05). Photoscan had the most visual errors (Chi Square, p < 0.001), and a RMSE of 10.9 cm. Pix4D had the best geometric accuracy with a RMSE of 7.7 cm, however this was not found to be statistically different from Photoscan (Tukey-Kramer, p > 0.05). In terms of price, Microsoft Image Composite Editor was the least expensive while Pix4D was the most expensive, although specific pricing varies depending on the type of licensing needed. These results suggest that unless high geometric accuracy or 3D images are required, ICE is the best option for most UAS photogrammetric applications.

            Correction of Atmospheric Refraction Geolocation Error for High Resolution Optical Satellite Pushbroom Images

                When an optical remote sensing satellite is imaging the Earth in-orbit, the propagation direction of the Line of Sight (LOS) will be changed because of atmospheric refraction. This will result in a geolocation deviation on the collinear rigorous geometric model for direct georeferencing, pushbroom images. To estimate and correct the atmospheric refraction geolocation error, the LOS vector tracking algorithm is introduced and a weighted mean algorithm is used to simplify the ISO standard atmospheric model into a troposphere and stratosphere, i.e., two layers spherical atmosphere. The simulation result shows the atmospheric refraction will introduce about 2 m and 7.5 m geometric displacement when the spacecraft is off-pointed view at 30 and 45 degree angle, respectively. For a state-of-the-art high resolution satellite, the atmospheric refraction displacement shall be corrected. The method has been practiced in the DMC3/TripleSat Constellation to remove the atmospheric refraction geolocation error without ground control points.

            Predicting Palustrine Wetland Probability Using Random Forest Machine Learning and Digital Elevation Data-Derived Terrain Variables

                The probability of palustrine wetland occurrence in the state of West Virginia, USA, was mapped based on topographic variables and using random forests (RF) machine learning. Models were developed for both selected ecological subregions and the entire state. The models were first trained using pixels randomly selected from the United States National Wetland Inventory (NWI) dataset and were tested using a separate random subset from the NWI and a database of wetlands not found in the NWI provided by the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources (WVDNR). The models produced area under the curve (AUC) values in excess of 0.90, and as high as 0.998. Models developed in one ecological subregion of the state produced significantly different AUC values when applied to other subregions, indicating that the topographical models should be extrapolated to new physiographic regions with caution. Several previously unexplored DEM-derived terrain variables were found to be of value, including distance from water bodies, roughness, and dissection. Non-NWI wetlands were mapped with an AUC value of 0.956, indicating that the probability maps may be useful for finding potential palustrine wetlands not found in the NWI .
