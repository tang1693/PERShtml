                The classification and mapping accuracy of urban land cover and land use has always been a critical topic and several auxiliary data have been used to improve the classification accuracy. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is limited knowledge of the addition of airborne Light Detection and Ranging (lidar)-Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and Topographic Position Index (TPI) for urban land cover and land use classification and mapping. The aim of this study was to explore the addition of airborne lidar-DEM and derived TPI to reflect data of Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) in improving the classification accuracy of urban land cover and land use map- ping. Specifically, this study explored the mapping accuracies of urban land cover and land use classifications derived using: 1) standalone Landsat OLI satellite data; 2) Landsat OLI with acquired airborne lidar-DEM ; 3) Landsat OLI with TPI ; and 4) Landsat OLI with airborne lidar-DEM and derived TPI. The results showed that the addition of airborne lidar-DEM and TPI yielded the best overall urban land cover and land use classification accuracy of about 88%. The findings in this study demonstrated that both lidar-DEM and TPI had a positive impact in improving urban land cover and land use classification.

                Building height information is essential for many applications such as urban planning and population density estimation. The building shadow length varies according to seasons, which is shown as different digital number values in multi-temporal images. Thus, the bi-temporal satellite remote sensing images of Sentinel-2 are used to estimate the buildings height in this study. An area of 15 km × 15 km in Beijing, China is taken as the study area. By preprocessing the data, the remaining pixels are split into two parts: 70% as the training data set and the rest as the testing data set. Then, one classification model and three regression models are proposed with using Random Forest (RF) method. Based on the testing data, it shows that the accuracy rate of the classification model has reached 98.4% with the kappa coefficient of 0.93. And the regression models' root-mean-square error (RMSE) is 0.61 floor for 1–6 floors group, 0.41 floor for 7–12 floor group, and 0.98 floor for above 12 floor group. The final RMSE is 1.62 floor with RF models. In general, this study shows the feasibility of using satellite mid-resolution optical image to estimate the building height and provides an important reference for regional building height estimation in the future.

                This study presents a method to generate historical orthomosaics using Structure-from-Motion (SfM ) photogrammetry, historical aerial photographs, and lidar data, and then analyzes the horizontal accuracy and factors that can affect the quality of historical orthoimagery products made with these approaches. Two sets of historical aerial photographs (1934 and 1951) were analyzed, focused on the town of Woodstock in Connecticut, U.S.A. Ground control points (GCPs) for georeferencing were obtained by overlaying multiple data sets, including lidar elevation data and derivative hillshades, and recent orthoimagery. Root-Mean-Square Error values of check points (CPs ) for 1934 and 1951 orthomosaics without extreme outliers are 0.83 m and 1.37 m, respectively. Results indicate that orthomosaics can be used for standard mapping and geographic information systems (GIS ) work according to the ASPRS 1990 accuracy standard. In addition, results emphasize that three main factors can affect the horizontal accuracy of orthomosaics: (1) types of CPs, (2) the number of tied photos, and (3) terrain.

                Rapid urbanization has become an immense problem in Lahore city, causing various socio-economic and environmental problems. Therefore, it is noteworthy to monitor land use/land cover (LULC) change detection and future LULC patterns in Lahore. The present study focuses on evaluating the current extent and modeling the future LULC developments in Lahore, Pakistan. Therefore, the semi-automatic classification model has been applied for the classification of Landsat satellite imagery from 2000 to 2020. And the Modules of Land Use Change Evaluation (MOLUSCE) cellular automata (CA-ANN) model was implemented to simulate future land use trends for the years 2030 and 2040. This study project made use of Landsat, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model, and vector data. The research methodology includes three main steps: (i) semi-automatic land use classification using Landsat data from 2000 to 2020; (ii) future land use prediction using the CA-ANN (MOLUSCE) model; and (iii) monitoring change detection and interpretation of results. The research findings indicated that there was a rise in urban areas and a decline in vegetation, barren land, and water bodies for both the past and future projections. The results also revealed that about 27.41% of the urban area has been increased from 2000 to 2020 with a decrease of 42.13% in vegetation, 2.3% in barren land, and 6.51% in water bodies, respectively. The urban area is also expected to grow by 23.15% between 2020 and 2040, whereas vegetation, barren land, and water bodies will all decline by 28.05%, 1.8%, and 12.31%, respectively. Results can also aid in the long-term, sustainable planning of the city. It was also observed that the majority of the city's urban area expansion was found to have occurred in the city's eastern and southern regions. This research also suggests that decision-makers and municipal Government should reconsider city expansion strategies. Moreover, the future city master plans of 2050 must emphasize the relevance of rooftop urban planting and natural resource conservation.
