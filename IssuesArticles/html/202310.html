                Lotus wetland is a type of wetland that can efficiently purify water. Therefore, rapid and accurate remote sensing monitoring of the distribution of lotus wetland has great significance to their conservation and the promotion of a sustainable and healthy development of ecosystems. The phenology-based method has proven effective in mapping some different types of wetlands. However, because of the serious absence of remote sensing data caused by cloud coverage and the differences in the phenological rhythms of lotus wetlands in different areas, achieving high-precision mapping of different regions using a unified approach is a challenge. To address the issue, this article proposes a Phenology Normalized Lotus Index (PNLI) model that combines SAR time-series imagery and the phenology-based method. The results of this study demonstrate that the PNLI model shows good applicability in different areas and has high mapping accuracy. The model can map the lotus wetland distribu tion in large areas quickly and simultaneously with high precision.

                Many remote sensing and geoscience applications require a high-precision terrain model. In 2022, the Forest And Buildings removed Copernicus digital elevation model (FABDEM) was released, in which trees and buildings were removed at a 30 m resolution. Therefore, it was necessary to make a comprehensive evaluation of this model. This research aims to perform a qualitative and quantitative analysis of fabdem in comparison with the commonly used global dems. We investigated the effect of the terrain slope, aspect, roughness, and land cover types in causing errors in the topographic representation of all dems. The fabdem had the highest overall vertical accuracy of 5.56 m. It was the best dem in representing the terrain roughness. The fabdem and Copernicus dem were equally influenced by the slopes more than the other models and had the worst accuracy of slope representation. In the tree, built, and flooded vegetation areas of the fabdem, the mean errors in elevation have been reduced by approximately 3.34 m, 1.26 m and 1.55 m, respectively. Based on Welch's t-test, there was no significant difference between fabdem and Copernicus dem elevations. However, the slight improvements in the fabdem make it the best filtered dem to represent the terrain heights over different land cover types.

            Evaluating Surface Mesh Reconstruction Using Real Data

                Surface reconstruction has been studied thoroughly, but very little work has been done to address its evaluation. In this article, we propose new visibility-based metrics to assess the completeness and accuracy of three-dimensional meshes based on a point cloud of higher accuracy than the one from which the reconstruction has been computed. We use the position from which each high-quality point has been acquired to compute the corresponding ray of free space. Based on the intersections between each ray and the reconstructed surface, our metrics allow evaluating both the global coherency of the reconstruction and the accuracy at close range. We validate this evaluation protocol by surveying several open-source algorithms as well as a piece of licensed software on three data sets. The results confirm the relevance of assessi ng local and global accuracy separately since algorithms sometimes fail at guaranteeing both simultaneously. In addition, algorithms making use of sensor positions perform better than the ones relying only on points and normals, indicating a potentially significant added value of this piece of information. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/umrlastig/SurfaceReconEval.

                Urban vegetation phenology is important for understanding the relationship between human activities on urban ecosystems and carbon cycle. The relationship between urban and rural vegetation phenology and environmental and meteorological factors were studied across urban-rural gradients. However, the relationship of intra-urban urbanization intensity (UI) gradients on vegetation at the start of season (SOS) is unclear. Here, we used remote sensing data to quantitatively assess the relationship of vegetation SOS to UI gradients at mid-high latitudes in the northern hemisphere. The results showed that urban area vegetation SOS widely presented earlier than for rural area vegetation. Across the cities we investigated the extent UI gradient was prevalent as a threshold (33.2% ¬± 2.3%) of surface temperature to SOS advance enhancement and offset. At low urbanization enhanced surface temperature on sos advances, while at high urbanization offset surface temperature on SOS advances. Overall, UI demonstrated a nonlinear relationship with sos. The results of this study suggest that there may be thresholds of impact on vegetation SOS in future global climate and environment change processes, where opposite effects can occur below and above thresholds.
