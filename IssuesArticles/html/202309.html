                The transformation of global navigation satellite systems coordi- nates between any two datums represents a vital procedure. Although the geocentric coordinates (X, Y, Z) of two datums can be trans- formed using the 7-parameters method, the conversion of Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projected coordinates (E, N) between two systems cannot be applied with the same procedure. However, see Jassim (2022), which discusses a method that allows the transformation between any two datums using the utm projected coordinates directly regarding the variation of the datum's semi-major axis and the eccentricity. The results of the evaluation of this method show that there is a significant shift in the transformed coordinates due to the imperfection of the used algorithm. While this research suggests a modification in the previous algorithm by adding the latitude's variation as a third significant factor besides the other two variations (∂a, ∂e2, and Δ), the suggested modification gives a high decline in the uncertainty of the position values. Furthermore, it takes a homogenous fixed limit for different places over Iraqi territory.

                Edge detection is highly susceptible to streaking caused by speckles in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) imagery. In this article, we address hysteresis thresholding for suppress streaking in PolSAR's edge detection. As an example, an approach is suggested by combining the constant false alarm ratio (CFAR) detector and the hysteresis thresholding. After thinning edges obtained by the CFAR detector, the hysteresis thresholding is employed to reduce edge streaking, which is caused by abundant speckles. A ratio of the high to the low threshold Pfain the hysteresis thresholding is pointed out for linking edges. Experiments are carried out on both simulated and real PolSAR data sets, and the results reveal that hysteresis thresh- olding obviously promotes the performance of the CFAR detector.

            Leveraging NAIP Imagery for Accurate Large-Area Land Use/land Cover Mapping: A Case Study in Central Texas

                Large-area land use land cover (LULC) mapping using high-resolution imagery remains challenging due to radiometric differences between scenes, the low spectral depth of the imagery, landscape heterogeneity, and computational limitations. Using a random forest (RF)- supervised machine-learning algorithm, we present a geographic object-based image analysis approach to classifying a large mosaic of 220 National Agriculture Imagery Program orthoimagery into lulc categories. The approach was applied in central Texas, USA, covering over 6000 km2. We generated 36 variables for each object and accounted for spatial structures of sample data to determine the distance at which samples were spatially independent. The final rf model produced 94.8% accuracy on independent stratified random samples. In addition, vegetation and water indices, the mean and standard deviation of principal components, and texture features improved classification accuracy. This study demonstrates a cost-effective way of producing an accurate multi-class land use/land cover map using high-spatial/low-spectral resolution orthoimagery.

                Bathymetric data, comprising elevations of submerged surfaces (e. g., seafloor or lake bed), constitute a critical need for a wide range of science and application focus areas, such as safety of marine navi- gation, benthic habitat mapping, flood inundation modeling, and coastal engineering. Over the past decade, the availability of near- shore bathymetric data has increased dramatically due to advances in satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB). One notable advance occurred with the 2018 launch of NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2), carrying the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS). However, much like other Earth observing satellites, ATLAS is often hampered by obstructions, such as clouds, which block the sensor's view of the Earth's surface. In this study, we introduce the Deep Occlusion Recovery of Satellite Lidar From ICESat-2 Network (DORSL-FIN) to recover partially occluded bathymetric profiles. We show that DORSL-FIN is able to accurately recover occluded bathymetry and outperforms other methods of interpolation.
