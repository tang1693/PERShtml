                We propose a point segmentation and grouping method to generate road maps from GPS traces. First, we present a progressive point cloud segmentation algorithm based on Total Least Squares (TLS) line fitting. Second, we group topologically connected point clusters by the point's orientation and cluster's spatial proximity, where the topological relationship is generated using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) map matching. Finally, we refine the intersections of roads so that their geometrical and topological relationships are consistent with each other. Experimental results show that our algorithm is robust to noises and the generated road network has a high accuracy in terms of geometry and topology. Compare to the representative algorithms; the results of our new algorithm have a higher F-measure score for different matching thresholds.

                In recent years, proximal sensing data has increasingly been used to optimize forest inventories. In this paper we present a forest inventory methodology based on stereoscopic hemispherical images. An automated pixel-based approach and a user-guided “region growing” approach have been developed for image matching. To estimate the basal area, number of trees and mean diameter, the sampling probability is determined for each tree. The accuracy and precision of the estimates derived from stereoscopic hemispherical images was analyzed for a set of National Forest Inventory plots. The results revealed that tree matching depends on the species, the distance to the target tree and the diameter. The Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.86 for the mean diameter and 0.89 for the basal area, whereas for the number of trees per hectare it was 0.59. The proposed methods may be used in large scale forest inventories as a cost-efficient way of obtaining data on diameter distribution and basal area from field surveys following a two-stage scheme combined with remote sensing techniques.

                Earth observation imagery collected by the series of Landsat satellites constitutes the longest and most consistent collection of moderate spatial resolution remotely sensed data. Feedback from the Landsat user community has played an important role in assessing its utility and making improvements to future Landsat missions. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA) continue to input from user communities. This paper describes the outcome of soliciting input from experts associated with AmericaView (AV), a non-profit organization aimed at promoting remote sensing applications in theUS. TheAVcommunity identified the importance of rigorously calibrated Landsat data forLULCapplications at the state level and made several recommendations for future Landsat missions. Recommendations suggested by the community ofAVexperts provide extremely valuable insights toUSGSandNASAto further their discussions about the design and operation of future Landsat missions.

            Quantitative Estimation and Validation of the Effects of the Convergence, Bisector Elevation, and Asymmetry Angles on the Positioning Accuracies of Satellite Stereo Pairs

                The convergence, bisector elevation (BIE), and asymmetry angles are three angles that describe the geometric conditions in stereo imaging. In this study, the effects of the angles on the positioning accuracies of stereo pairs were investigated. First, through careful observation of the stereo geometry that determines the ray-intersection in object space, the effects of the angles were visualized and quantified. Second, formulas to estimate the positioning errors, including these quantified effects, were proposed. Third, the formulas were validated using real satellite data. Our experiment results confirmed the accuracy variations due to the angles, both visually and quantitatively, and that all angles may significantly affect both the horizontal and vertical accuracies, particularly for dual-satellite stereo with weak geometry. The primary contributions of this paper are the provision of theoretical background of the effects of the angles and experimental confirmations of the quantitative effects of them on the stereo positioning accuracies.

            Cropland Extraction Based on OBIA and Adaptive Scale Pre-estimation

                Object-based image analysis (OBIA) provides a solution for cropland extraction from high spatial resolution remote sensing images. Currently, scale parameter selection is often dependent on subjective trial-and-error methods or post-evaluation of multi-segmentation, which directly reduces efficiency of cropland extraction. This paper proposes a cropland extraction method combining spatial statistics based adaptive scale parameter pre-estimation and object-oriented classification. SPOT5 multi-spectral image in Baishan is used as experimental data to verify the validity of the methodology. Experimental results show that the pre-estimated scale parameter can yield a classification result with both high classification accuracy and completeness for extracting cropland information. This presented method avoids the time-consuming trial-and-error practice by accelerating the object-oriented classification procedure. Hierarchical rule set based classifications achieve higher accuracies and lower fragmentation than nearest neighbor-supervised classification. Additionally, this methodology can be rapidly transplanted into different regions and it is helpful for dynamic land-use monitoring and precision agriculture.

                Tamarisk is an invasive, riparian shrub species in the southwestern USA. The northern tamarisk beetle (Diorhabda carinulata) has been introduced to several states to control tamarisk. We classified tamarisk distribution in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, Arizona using 0.2 m resolution, airborne multispectral data and estimated tamarisk beetle effects (overall accuracy of 86 percent) leading to leaf defoliation in a 49,408 m2area. We also estimated individual tamarisk tree biomass and their uncertainties using airborne lidar data (100 points/m2). On average, total aboveground tamarisk biomass was 8.68 kg/m2 (SD= 17.6). The tamarisk beetle defoliation resulted in a mean leaf biomass loss of 0.52 kg/m2and an equivalent of 25,692 kg across the entire study area. Our defoliated tamarisk map and biomass estimates can help inform restoration treatments to reduce tamarisk. Continued monitoring of tamarisk and tamarisk beetle effects are recommended to understand the currently-unknown eventual equilibrium between the two species and the cascading effects on ecosystem processes.
