                The objective was to test GEographic Object-based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) techniques for delineating neighborhoods of Accra, Ghana using QuickBird multispectral imagery. Two approaches to aggregating census enumeration areas (EAs) based on image-derived measures of vegetation objects were tested: (a) merging adjacent EAs according to vegetation measures, and (b) image segmentation. Both approaches exploit readily available functions within commercial GEOBIA software. Image-derived neighborhood maps were compared to a reference map derived by spatial clustering of slum index values (from census data), to provide a relative assessment of potential map utility. A size-constrained iterative segmentation approach to aggregation was more successful than standard image segmentation or feature merge techniques. The segmentation approaches account for size and shape characteristics, enabling more realistic neighborhood boundaries to be delineated. The percentage of vegetation patches within each EA yielded more realistic delineation of potential neighborhoods than mean vegetation patch size per EA.

                The Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) is a waveform lidar system carried on board the Ice, Cloud, and Elevation Satellite (ICESat). This study tested the use of GLAS data, from the L3e and L3g campaigns, to estimate total canopy height. GLAS footprint locations were sampled for reference data. The GLAS-derived and field-derived canopy heights portrayed good correlation (R2= 0.8354).This study also examined two representative fire fuel models within forests in East-Central Mississippi. GLAS waveforms were compared with field data for fire fuel models 9 and 10 of the fire fuel models described by Anderson (1982). GLAS data intensities were extracted and averaged to create predictive variables. Two variables were applied in Logistic regression to predict the probability of belonging to either fuel model (overall accuracy = 0.6875).

            Assessment of Geo-positioning Capability of High Resolution Satellite Imagery for Densely Populated High Buildings in Metropolitan Areas

                This paper analyzes the geo-positioning capability of highresolution satellite images in a very special metropolitan environment where within a relatively small region there are a large number of densely populated skyscrapers and high buildings. A pair of QuickBird stereo images covering downtown Shanghai were used for analysis. Multi-source data including GPS survey data, aerial images, and lidar data collected in the same area were used for Ground Control Points (GCPs) and Independent Check Points (ICPs) measurements and accuracy analysis. The vendor-provided Rational Function Model followed by a translation and scale correction model in image space was used to introduce the ground control and improve geo-positioning accuracy. The experimental results revealed that there is a clear dependency of geo-positioning accuracy on elevation where the GCPs are placed. Using the vendor-provided RFM and several GCPs across all the elevation ranges improves the overall geo-positioning accuracy.

            An Assessment of WorldView-1 Positional Accuracy based on Fifty Contiguous Stereo Pairs of Imagery

                This paper presents an assessment of WorldView-1 3D positional extraction accuracy based on 50 overlapping and contiguous stereo pairs of WorldView-1 imagery covering approximately 50,000 square kilometers of the earthâ€™s surface. Absolute accuracy is both predicted using error propagation and measured using reference points. Shear, a form of relative accuracy, is also assessed between each overlapping stereo pair of images. Accuracy is assessed for two different processing approaches: extraction from individual stereo pairs, and extraction from stereo pairs following the fusion of information across all overlapping stereo pairs. The latter approach was implemented with Metric Information Network (MIN) processing, an efficient process with results equivalent to a simultaneous block adjustment. Both approaches used no ground control, although in a separate sub-experiment, MIN processing was supplemented with a sparse set of ground control (GPS surveyed) points.

                Adaptive training is critical for image classification by artificial neural networks (ANNs). While the machine learning community has been enthusiastic in developing various training algorithms, little research has been conducted to evaluate the performance of these algorithms in image classification by neural networks. We introduce and evaluate nine commonly-used training algorithms in terms of their performance in land-cover classification from remotely sensed data by the multi-layer-perceptron (MLP) neural networks. MLP has been considered as the most popular neural network architecture. The training algorithms we consider are Steepest Gradient Descent, Gradient Descent with Momentum, Resilient Propagation, Fletcher-Reeves, Polak-Ribiere, Powell-Beale, Scaled Conjugate Gradient, BFGS (Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb, and Shanno), and Levenberg- Marquardt. We use each algorithm to train the MLP networks multiple times using identical training samples, and then apply each of the resultant network models to derive landcover information from a Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image. The training algorithms are further evaluated according to their training efficiency, capability of convergence, classification accuracy, and stability of the classification accuracy. It is found that the performance of these algorithms varies substantially and selecting an appropriate algorithm can lead to a fast and efficient training and an increase in land-cover classification accuracy by artificial neural networks.

            Combining Aerial Photogrammetry and Terrestrial Lidar for Reservoir Analog Modeling

                High-resolution aerial photography was captured covering a geological outcrop at Castle Creek, British Columbia, Canada. Here, for the purposes of hydrocarbon analog modeling, the outcrop was required to be accurately surveyed, so that key stratigraphic surfaces could be mapped in three dimensions. Because the outcrop strata were vertically orientated, these surfaces could be tracked over a wide area; however, to provide a true reconstruction of the geology, it was necessary to also model localized vertical cliffs providing a cross-section through the stratigraphy. Terrestrial lidar was utilized to cover these cliff sections which were poorly represented in the 2.5D aerial data. The integrated outcrop surface was textured with metric aerial and terrestrial imagery providing a photorealistic model that could be used for interpretation by geologists. This formed the basis for building a geocellular model of the geological volume, which was used to assist in the understanding of subsurface reservoirs where data are often limited.

            Linearization of NDVI Based on its Relationship with Vegetation Fraction

                The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is widely used for global monitoring of land surface vegetation dynamics from space. However, it is well documented that the NDVI approaches saturation asymptotically over highly vegetated areas. In this study, a linearized NDVI (LNDVI) is derived by introducing a linearity-adjustment factor, b, into the NDVI equation to improve the linearity of the relationship with vegetation fraction and mitigate the saturation problem encountered by NDVI. The linearity of the LNDVI is demonstrated using a ground-observed data set and a modelsimulated data set. A functional relationship and consistence of LNDVI with other NDVI adaptations are found, providing independent justification of the value of the NDVI adaptations. Due to its improved linearity with vegetation fraction, this index would provide more accurate monitoring of vegetation dynamics and estimation of biophysical parameters. The LNDVI can be derived from historical NDVI datasets directly without knowledge of input reflectances.
