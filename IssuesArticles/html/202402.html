                The advancements in space technology have facilitated water quality (WQ) monitoring of lake conditions at a spatial resolution of 10 m by freely accessible Sentinel-2 images. The main aim of this article was to elucidate the necessity of spatiotemporal WQ monitoring of the shrinking Lake Burdur in Türkiye by examining the relation between field and satellite data with a state-of-the-art machine learning- based regression algorithm. This study focuses on detection of algal blooms and WQ parameters, which are chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and suspended solids (SS). Furthermore, this study leverages the advantage of geographic position of Lake Burdur, located at the overlap of two Sentinel-2 frames, which enables the acquisition of satellite images at a temporal resolution of 2–3 days. The findings enrich the understanding of the lake's dynamic structure by rapidly monitoring the occurrence of algal blooms. High accuracies were achieved for Chl-a (R-squared: 0.93) and SS (R-squared: 0.94) detection.

                The aim of the study is to identify factors affecting the sight-aesthetic value of the underwater landscapes of lakes for the purposes of exploration tourism. The reason for undertaking this topic is the lack of such studies for inland water bodies. The results will contribute to expanding and supplementing the knowledge on the assessment of the sight-aesthetic attractiveness of landscapes and fill gaps in knowledge about the underwater landscapes of lakes. The questionnaire survey implemented the direct comparison method described by Kendall (Kendall, M. G. 1970.Rank Correlation Methods. Charles Griffin and Co: Glasgow, Scotland). According to respondents, animals and submerged anthropogenic elements are the most visually attractive in an aquatic environment The results obtained are the reason for conducting further research and developing the methodology for the assessment of the sight-aesthetic value of inland bodies of water based on the experience of terrestrial landscape researchers.

            Crop Monitoring System Using MODIS Time-Series Data for Within-Season Prediction of Yield and Production of US Corn and Soybeans

                In terms of contribution to global food security, this study aimed to build a crop monitoring system for within-season yield prediction of US corn and soybeans by using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (time-series data, which consists of three essential core algorithms (crop phenology detection, early crop classification, and crop yield prediction methods)). Within-season predictions for 2018–2022 were then made to evaluate the perfor- mance of the proposed system by comparing it with the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) monthly forecasts and the fixed statistical data. The absolute percentage errors of the proposed system for predicting national-level yield and production were less than 5% for all simulation years as of day of year (DOY) 279. The prediction accuracy as of DOY 247 and DOY 279 were comparable to the USDA's forecasts. The proposed system would enable us to make a comprehensive understanding about overview of US corn and soybean crop condition by visualizing detail spatial pattern of good- or poor harvest regions on a within-season basis.

                Few-shot scene classification methods aim to obtain classification discriminative ability from few labeled samples and has recently seen substantial advancements. However, the current few-shot learning approaches still suffer from overfitting due to the scarcity of labeled samples. To this end, a few-shot semi-supervised method is proposed to address this issue. Specifically, semi-supervised learning method is used to increase target domain samples; then we train multiple classification models using the augmented samples. Finally, we perform decision fusion of the results obtained from the multiple models to accomplish the image classification task. According to the experiments conducted on two real few-shot remote sensing scene datasets, our proposed method achieves significantly higher accuracy (approximately 1.70% to 4.33%) compared to existing counterparts.
