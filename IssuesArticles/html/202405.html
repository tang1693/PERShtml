                Image segmentation is essential for object-oriented analysis, and classification is a critical parameter influencing analysis accuracy. However, image classification and segmentation based on spectral features are easily perturbed by the high-frequency information of a high spatial resolution remotely sensed (HSRRS) image, degrading its classification and segmentation quality. This article first presents a pixel texture index (PTI) by describing the texture and edge in a local area surrounding a pixel. Indeed.. The experimental results highlight that the HSRRS image classification and segmentation quality can be effectively improved by combining it with the PTI image. Indeed, the overall accuracy improved from 7% to 14%, and the kappa can be increased from 11% to 24%, respectively.

                Accurately obtaining crop cultivation extent and estimating the cultivated area are significant for adjusting regional planting structure. This article proposes a parcel-level crop classification method using time-series, medium-resolution, remote sensing images and single-phase, high-spatial-resolution, remote sensing images. The deep learning semantic segmentation network feature pyramid network with squeeze-and-excitation network (FPN???SENet) and multi-scale segmentation were used to extract cultivated land parcels from Gaofen-2 imagery, while the pixel-level crop types were classified by using support vector machine algorithms from time-series Sentinel-2 images. Then, the parcel-level crop classification was obtained from the pixel-level crop types and land parcels.

                Drought is a devastating natural hazard and exerts profound effects on both the environment and society. Predicting drought occurrences is significant in aiding decision-making and implementing effective mitigation strategies. In regions characterized by limited data availability, such as Southern Africa, the use of satellite remote sensing data promises an excellent opportunity for achieving this predictive goal. In this article, we assess the effectiveness of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) soil moisture data in predicting drought conditions using multiple linear regression???predicted data and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) soil moisture data.

                Debris flow susceptibility evaluation plays a crucial role in the prevention and control of debris flow disasters. Therefore, this article proposes a convolutional neural network model named multi-level feature extraction network (MFENet). First, a dual-channel CNN architecture incorporating the Embedding Channel Attention mechanism is used to extract shallow features from both digital elevation model images and multispectral images. Subsequently, channel shuffle and feature concatenation are applied to the features from the two channels to obtain fused feature sets. Following this, a deep feature extraction is performed on the fused feature sets using a residual module improved by maximum pooling. Finally, the susceptibility index of gullies to debris flows is calculated based on the similarity scores.
