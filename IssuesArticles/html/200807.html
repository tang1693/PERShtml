                In recent years impervious surface areas (ISA) have emerged as a key paradigm to explain and predict ecosystem health in relationship to watershed development. The ISA data are essential for environmental monitoring and management in coastal State of Rhode Island. However, there is lack of information on high spatial resolution ISA. In this study, we developed an algorithm of multiple agent segmentation and classification (MASC) that includes submodels of segmentation, shadow-effect, MANOVA-based classification, and post-classification. The segmentation sub-model replaced the spectral difference with heterogeneity change for regions merging. Shape information was introduced to enhance the performance of ISA extraction. The shadow-effect sub-model used a split-and-merge process to separate shadows and the objects that cause the shadows. The MANOVA-based classification sub-model took into account the relationship between spectral bands and the variability in the training objects and the objects to be classified. Existing GIS data were used in the classification and post-classification process. The MASC successfully extracted ISA from high spatial resolution airborne true-color digital orthophoto and space-borne QuickBird-2 imagery in the testing areas, and then was extended for extraction of high spatial resolution ISA in the State of Rhode Island.

                Both satellite images and aerial photographs are now used operationally in Finlandâ€™s forestry for different tasks; satellite images are used for national forest inventory purposes and aerial images for forest management planning. Due to the double coverage, it could be advantageous to utilize the strengths of both image types.The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of the combination of Landsat ETM+ spectral and aerial photograph spectral and textural features for forest variable estimation. The studied stand variables were mean height, basal area per hectare, and the volume of the growing stock. Several approaches were tested when combining the image data sources: feature selection, feature weighting, satellite image-based stratification, and combination of individual estimates by weighting.The highest accuracies were obtained when both data sources were used. There were several good ways to combine the data sources. Feature selection with genetic algorithm and subsequent feature weighting gave the lowest mean volume RMSE (63.7 m3/ha, 65.3 percent of the mean).

                Remote sensing techniques have been widely used to map fire scars in the western United States, but have not been thoroughly tested in the eastern portion of the country. In this study, a 1998 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image and a 1999 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM1) image were used to test different image enhancements and classification algorithms for mapping wildfire scars in Ocala National Forest, Florida. Single-date analysis was conducted using the 1999 image, while both images were used to complete multi-temporal analysis. Both single- and multi-date datasets were classified using a traditional method (maximum likelihood classification: MLC) and a non-parametric technique (classification and regression trees: CART). Comparison of all techniques showed that MLC of a single image (1999) resulted in high accuracy compared to the other methods and that principal components analysis (PCA) and multitemporal PCA provided the best spectral separability between burned and unburned areas.

                Eight change detection procedures and a hybrid forest type classification procedure were tested for their ability to detect forest land-cover change in east-central Mississippi. The best performing method was change vector analysis using vegetation indices with an image segmentation classification that produced an overall accuracy (82.50 percent) and overall Kappa (0.7900) calculated from error matrices. The hybrid forest type classification had an overall accuracy of 77.08 percent for 1997 and 71.25 percent for 2002. The results of this study were compared to a prior pilot inventory study for the same study area in east-central Mississippi. There was considerable disagreement between the two studies in terms of number of hectares in the age classes and the forest type classes, most likely attributed to the difference in methods for determining forest type classes.

                Riverine landscapes associated with large dynamic floodplains provide a complex array of habitats for fish. Mapping and quantitative assessment of the habitats poses a major challenge. This study uses high spatial resolution airborne digital photographs and forward-looking infrared (FLIR) images, simultaneously acquired in spring 2005 over a 12 river kilometer section of the Unuk River in Southeast Alaska to map macro habitat indicators for Pacific salmon such as large woody debris (LWD), water channels, sand/gravel bars, and riparian vegetation. Image processing revealed that LWD could best be extracted using contextual information from the digital photos. River channel water had prominent shadows cast from neighboring trees and could not be accurately classified using digital photos, but could be well-delineated using unsupervised classification of the FLIR images. All other classes showed up well using supervised classification of digital photos. Using a decision-based fusion approach, the best individual classification results obtained from the digital photos and FLIR images to generate an improved fluvial landscape classification map (land-cover map). Using a decision-based fusion method resulted in an overall classification accuracy of the study area to 84.29 percent, compared to 77.00 percent using supervised classification of aerial photos alone. This appears to be first time that high-resolution airborne thermal images have been used for fluvial landscape classification, and the study clearly demonstrates the value of using thermal images and decision-based fusion approach for improved land-cover classification.

                We introduce an event data set of the location and opening dates for 3,043 Wal-Mart stores as a means for validating land-cover change-related products at medium (28.5 m) to coarse (250 m to 1 km) resolutions throughout the conterminous United States. Strengths of the Wal-Mart validation data set include: construction within most U.S. ecoregions, building footprints greater than a hectare in size, and construction dates that span much of the remote sensing record (1962 to 2004). We built the data set by geo-coding Wal-Mart addresses, establishing opening dates, and geolocating the footprints of 30 stores using online free highresolution (4 m) imagery. Disturbance events were evident at 25 Wal-Marts within a single scene of the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS-beta) forest disturbance product. In addition, we found clear disturbance signals within two 16-day vegetation index time series: the 250 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer normalized difference product (MOD44C) and the 1 km enhanced vegetation index product (MOD13A2).

                Tropical forests in many areas of Central and South America experience strong seasonality in climatic variables such as rainfall, solar radiation, wind speed, and relative humidity. Such seasonality is typical of the mangrove forests we study along the Caribbean coast of Panama. Tied to this environmental variation are changes in leaf phenology and physiology that can affect the spectral properties of leaves and thus our ability to discriminate canopies of differing species composition. The goals of this study were two-fold. First, we compared the efficacy of three different classification methods for discriminating mangrove canopies, including a back-propagation, feed-forward neural network classifier with two hidden layers of 24 and 12 neurons (hereafter, BP:24:12), a newly developed clustering-based neural network classifier (CBNN), and a maximum likelihood classifier (MLC). Comparisons were made with and without added textural information. Our second aim was to compare the absolute and relative discrimination abilities of these methods when applied to images of the same forest acquired in different seasons. Two sets of Ikonos images acquired in February (dry season) and May (early wet season) 2004 were analyzed in this study. When only spectral information was considered, MLC and CBNN discriminated differences in canopy species composition with higher accuracy than the BP:24:12 method. When second-order textural information was also taken into account, CBNN outperformed MLC and presented the best classification accuracy, i.e., kappa value equaled 0.93. Analyses of the wet season (May) image were consistently more accurate in discriminating mangrove canopies of differing species composition than analyses of the dry season (February) image, regardless of the classification method or the inclusion of textural information.
