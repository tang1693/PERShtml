                Aiming at the problem of rapid construction of a river three-dimensional 3D scene, this article integrates remote sensing, 3D modeling, and CityEngine technology to construct a 3D scene model reconstruction method of river water-land integration. The method includes intelligent extraction of underwater topography, refined modeling of hydraulic structures, and construction of a water-land integrated real scene model. Based on this method, the high-fidelity land-underwater seamless digital terrain and the water-land 3D real scene models can be formed. Through experiments, the feasibility and limitations of this method are verified. It can effectively extract the shallow underwater terrain of inland rivers, and the overall accuracy of the study area is less than 2 m. The performance of the seamless fusion 3D terrain is better than the public digital elevation model data set. In the inland basin of Class I to II water quality, it can meet the needs of intelligent perception of a river- and lake-integrated 3D scene model.

                In this paper, an improved aerosol optical depth (AOD ) retrieval algorithm is proposed based on Sentinel-2 and AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET ) data. The surface reflectance for AOD retrieval was estimated from the image that had minimal aerosol contamination in a temporal window determined by AERONET data. Validation of the Sentinel-2 AOD retrievals was conducted against four Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET ) sites located in Beijing. The results show that the Sentinel-2 AOD retrievals are highly consistent with the AERONET AOD measurements (R = 0.942), with 85.56% falling within the expected error. The mean absolute error and the root-mean-square error are 0.0688 and 0.0882, respectively. In addition, the AOD distribution map obtained by this algorithm well reflects the fine-spatial-resolution changes in AOD distribution. These results suggest that the improved high-resolution AOD retrieval algorithm is robust and has the potential advantage of retrieving high-resolution AOD over urban areas.

                The detection of changes in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images based on deep learning has been widely used in landslides detection, flood disaster monitoring, and other fields of change detection due to its high classification accuracy. However, the inherent speckle noise in SAR images restricts the performance of existing SAR image change detection algorithms by clustering analysis. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel method for SAR image change detection based on clustering fusion and deep neural networks. We first used hierarchical fuzzy c-means clustering (HFCM ) to process two different images to obtain HFCM classification results. Then a fusion strategy is designed to obtain the fused image from the two HFCM classified images as the pre-classification result. Furthermore, a lightweight deep neural network com posed of a decomposition convolution module and an auxiliary classification module was proposed; the former module could reduce network parameters by 28%, and the latter could reduce network parameters by 33.3%. To improve the recognition performance of the network, the classification layer was replaced by the regression layer at the outcome of the network. By comparing the experiments of different methods on five data sets, the performance of our proposed method is superior.

            Strategies for Forest Height Estimation by High-Precision DEM Combined with Short-Wavelength PolInSAR TanDEM-X

                The purpose of this article is to explore forest height estimation strategies using topographic data (DEM) combined with TanDEM-X while comparing the effect of volume scattering complex coherence selection on forest height estimation in the traditional random volume over ground (RVoG) three-stage algorithm. In this study, four experimental strategies were designed for comparison based on TanDEM-X polarized interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PolInSAR) data, TanDEM-DEM, and 42 field-measured data. Our results show that in the RVoG model, (1) a reference ground phase to select the volume scattering complex coherence provides greater accuracy in determining forest height, (2) forest height estimation can be achieved by directly using DEM as ground phase information without relying on model solving and obtaining a more accurate forest height than TanDEM-X alone, and (3) the highest estimation accuracy is obtained by using DEM as coherence information among all schemes. Although the difference in forest height estimation results is not significant in this study, it still proves that the forest height estimation strategy of high-precision DEM combined with short-wavelength PolInSAR can not only improve the forest height estimation accuracy but also simplify the solving process of the RVoG model, which is an important reference for global forest parameter estimation and ecosystem detection based on spaceborne PolInSAR.
