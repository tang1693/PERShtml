                Accurate and rapid mapping of seismic building damage is essential to support rescue forces and estimate economic losses. Traditional methods have limitations: ground-based mapping is slow and largely limited to façade information, and image-based mapping is typically restricted to vertical (roof) views. Here, we assess the value of photogrammetrically processed airborne oblique, multi-perspective Pictometry data, in a two-step approach: (a) supervised classification into façades, intact roofs, destroyed roofs and vegetation using 22 image-derived features, and (b) combining the classification results from different viewing directions into a per-building damage score adapted from the European Macroseismic Scale (EMS 98) for damage classification (no-moderate damage, heavy damage, destruction). Overall classification accuracies for the four classes and for the building damage of 70 percent and 63 percent, respectively, were achieved. Image stereo overlap helped classify façades, but problems with the relatively vague EMS damage class definitions were encountered, and subjectivity in training data generation affected overall classification by up to 10 percent.

                In response to the devastating 12 January 2010, earthquake in Haiti, the US Geological Survey (USGS) provided essential coordinating services for remote sensing activities. Communication was rapidly established between the widely distributed response teams and data providers to define imaging requirements and sensor tasking opportunities. Data acquired from a variety of sources were received and archived by the USGS, and these products were subsequently distributed using the Hazards Data Distribution System (HDDS) and other mechanisms. Within six weeks after the earthquake, over 600,000 files representing 54 terabytes of data were provided to the response community. The USGS directly supported a wide variety of groups in their use of these data to characterize post-earthquake conditions and to make comparisons with pre-event imagery. The rapid and continuing response achieved was enabled by existing imaging and ground systems, and skilled personnel adept in all aspects of satellite data acquisition, processing, distribution and analysis. The information derived from image interpretation assisted senior planners and on-site teams to direct assistance where it was most needed.

                We report about a preliminary study to evaluate the use of semi-automated imaging analysis of remotely-sensed DEM and field geophysical measurements to develop a seismic-zonation map of Port-au-Prince, Haiti. For in situ data, Vs30 values are derived from the MASW technique deployed in and around the city. For satellite imagery, we use an ASTER GDEM of Hispaniola. We apply both pixel- and object-based imaging methods on the ASTER GDEM to explore local topography (absolute elevation values) and classify terrain types such as mountains, alluvial fans and basins/near-shore regions. We assign NEHRP seismic site class ranges based on available Vs30 values. A comparison of results from imagery-based methods to results from traditional geologic-based approaches reveals good overall correspondence. We conclude that image analysis of RS data provides reliable first-order site characterization results in the absence of local data and can be useful to refine detailed site maps with sparse local data.

            Rapid Damage Assessment and Situation Mapping: Learning from the 2010 Haiti Earthquake

                The paper reports on the activity of the Center for Satellite based Crisis Information (ZKI) of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in Port-au-Prince, Haiti on 12 January 2010. DLR/ZKI closely coordinated with the European Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) program and the International Charter Space and Major Disasters. All DLR/ZKI damage maps are based on a specific analysis approach, including preprocessing procedures and visual interpretation on a grid-basis. As the satellite-based mapping response globally was so extensive for this event, problems resulting from the large number and inconsistency of satellite maps generated internationally are addressed. In order to avoid this kind of “mapping challenge” in future the setting-up of an international working group to elaborate global guidelines and cooperation procedures for better coherence of international satellite rapid mapping efforts for extreme events such as the Haiti earthquake is suggested.

                A methodology for automated extraction of damage indication from very high spatial resolution satellite imagery is presented for the Haitian towns of Carrefour and Léogâne following the January 2010 earthquake. Damaged buildings are identified by changes to their shadows between pre- and post-event data. The approach makes use of object-based image analysis concepts to extract relevant information on damage distribution. The methodology selected requires preand post-disaster images with similar sun angles and will only be suitable for the detection of collapsed (or partly collapsed) structures. The new methodology proved to be effective for the Carrefour area despite using satellite images of different qualities with inadequate image (co-)registration, producing positively validated results within an acceptable processing time, and was, to the best of our knowledge, the only automated damage assessment method to have delivered appropriate results to requesting relief organizations within a few days of the Haiti earthquake.

                Immediately following the 12 January 2010 earthquake in Haiti, a disaster response team from Rochester Institute of Technology, ImageCat Inc., and Kucera International, funded by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery group of the World Bank, collected 0.15 m airborne imagery and two points/m2lidar data for 650 km2over a period of seven days. Data were transferred to Rochester, New York for processing at rates that approached 400 Mb/s using Internet2, ortho-rectified with a 24-hour turnaround, and distributed to response agencies through file or disk transfer. A unique response effort, dubbed the Global Earth Observation - Catastrophe Assessment Network (GEO-CAN) and headed by ImageCat, utilized over 600 experts from 23 different countries to generate rapid turnaround damage assessment products. This paper highlights the airborne data collection, transfer, processing, and product development effort, which arguably has raised the bar in terms of response to large-scale disasters.
