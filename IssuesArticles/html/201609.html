                Web mapping and virtual globes are increasingly used to communicate 3D geospatial results to fellow researchers and the public. The lack of analytical functionality nonetheless restricts their utility in research, including archaeology. Integrating both 3D and analytical functionalities should result in a 4D archaeological GIS that can be used throughout the archaeological workflow. This paper investigates the feasibility of extending a virtual globe to such a user-friendly system. This involves a technical assessment by comparing the characteristics of virtual globes with user, data, functional, and organizational requirements. The prototypical implementation consequently uses CesiumÂ® as basis. This prototype served for the practical feasibility evaluation. The usability test with two Flemish archaeological organizations has shown broad support for a low-threshold 4D ArcheoGIS from its potential end-users. Although public activities, analyses, and fieldwork preparations were mentioned as application domains, extending the system to fit archaeological workflows or a cyberinfrastructure is necessary.

                U.S. Geological Survey scientists developed a dataset of 2006 and 2011 land-use and land-cover (LULC) information for selected 100-km2sample blocks within 29 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Level III ecoregions across the conterminous United States. The data can be used with the previously published Land Cover Trends Dataset: 1973 to 2000 to assess landuse/land-cover change across a 37-year study period. Results from analysis of these data include ecoregion-based statistical estimates of the amount ofLULCchange per time period, ranking of the most common types of conversions, rates of change, and percent composition. Overall estimated amount of change per ecoregion from 2001 to 2011 ranged from a low of 370 km2in the Northern Basin and Range Ecoregion to a high of 78,782 km2in the Southeastern Plains Ecoregion. The Southeastern Plains continues to encompass one of the most intense forest harvesting and regrowth regions in the country, with 16.6 percent of the ecoregion changing between 2001 and 2011. TheseLULCchange statistics provide a new, valuable resource that complements other reference data and field-verifiedLULCdata. Researchers can use this resource to independently validate other land change products or to conduct regional land change assessments.

            An Individual Tree-Based Automated Registration of Aerial Images to LiDAR Data in a Forested Area

                In this paper, we demonstrate an approach to align aerial images to airborne lidar data by using common object features (tree tops) from both data sets under the condition that conventional correlation-based approaches are challenging due to the fact that the spatial pattern of pixel gray-scale values in aerial images hardly exist in lidar data. We extracted tree tops by using an image processing technique called extended-maxima transformation from both aerial images and lidar data. Our approach was tested at the Angelo Coast Range Reserve on the South Fork Eel River forests in Mendocino County, California. Although the aerial images were acquired simultaneously with the lidar data, the images had only approximate exposure point locations and average flight elevation information, which mimicked the condition of limited information availability about the aerial images. Our results showed that this approach enabled us to align aerial images to airborne lidar data at the single-tree level with reasonable accuracy. With a local transformation model (piecewise linear model), theRMSEand the median absolute deviation (MAD) of the registration were 9.2 pixels (2.3 meters) and 6.8 pixels (1.41 meters), respectively. We expect our approach to be applicable to fine scale change detection for forest ecosystems and may serve to extract detailed forest biophysical parameters.

                A new approach to locating accuracy assessment sample units was used to quantify 2010 land cover accuracy, in addition to being able to make statements about 2006-2010 land cover change mapping accuracy for National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) data. Three customized tiers of sampling strata were created, as discussed, to meet these goals. Stratified random sampling was employed in each stratum with a six out of nine pixel-homogeneity criteria (different from the final minimum mapping unit) required for each sampling unit. Accuracy was assessed for nine regions in the coastal United States with overall accuracy ranging from 82.3 percent to 85.6 percent. Binary change was mapped with 88.7 percent accuracy, with the largest error being errors of commission (71.2 percent user accuracy). This sampling design also allowed for the identification of 137 locations where true change was not mapped, allowing for statements to be made about missed change.

                Change detection based on multi-temporalSARimages is a fundamental process in many practical applications. PopularSARchange detectors include ratio and logarithmic-ratio (log-ratio) operators, and those based on a statistical similarity between temporal images. The ratio and log-ratio operators are not ideal for polarimetricSAR(POLSAR) images, as only the intensity or amplitude information is used. Change detectors based on similarity comparison of probability distribution functions are difficult to implement and not reliable because of the uncertainties in estimating distribution parameters. Our research aims to find a reliable and computationally simple change detector from among three typical polarimetric distance measures. The change detection potential and abilities of these distance measures are analyzed from a mathematical point of view, and then compared through a test dataset composed of twoRADARSAT-2fine-quad polarized images. The symmetric revised Wishart (SRW) distance, originally developed for image segmentation, is found to be an effective change detector. Based on the test data, the change map derived from theSRWdistance achieves 93.24 percent change rate and 5.67 percent false alarm rate. Furthermore, the eigendecompostion of theSRWdistance is given for the first time, which uncovers the linkage of theSRWdistance with the scattering mechanisms and the corresponding amplitudes embedded in two polarimetric covariance matrices, forming a theoretical explanation for the superiority of theSRWdistance as a change detector. Our research indicates the general applicability of theSRWdistance forPOLSARchange detection.

                This paper proposes a new morphological mining feature index (MMFI) by synthesizing multi-scale and multi-direction differential morphological profiles (DMPs) to effectively separateREMASfrom other land covers with similar spectral signals and local brightness contrast. TheMMFIenhances the local brightness contrast of rare earth mining areas (REMAS) by highlighting the morphological characteristics ofREMAstructure, and improves the identification of roads and bare soil, which have similar spectral signatures toREMAS. Moreover, a new threshold optimization method that maximizes the histogram entropy is presented, wherebyREMAScan be automatically extracted from theMMFIimage without sample collection and machine learning. Therefore, it is a fully automatic method suitable forREMAextraction over large areas. To validate the proposed method, three temporal Landsat images acquired of Changting County, China, were used to extractREMAinformation. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve good classification accuracy compared with other methods.
