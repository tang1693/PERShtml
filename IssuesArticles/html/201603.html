                Machine learning approaches such as random forest have increased for the spatial modeling and mapping of continuous variables. Random forest is a non-parametric ensemble approach, and unlike traditional regression approaches there is no direct quantification of prediction error. Understanding prediction uncertainty is important when using model-based continuous maps as inputs to other modeling applications such as fire modeling. Here we use a Monte Carlo approach to quantify prediction uncertainty for random forest regression models. We test the approach by simulating maps of dependent and independent variables with known characteristics and comparing actual errors with prediction errors. Our approach produced conservative prediction intervals across most of the range of predicted values. However, because the Monte Carlo approach was data driven, prediction intervals were either too wide or too narrow in sparse parts of the prediction distribution. Overall, our approach provides reasonable estimates of prediction uncertainty for random forest regression models.

                Landsat imagery mosaics developed using model II regression have been shown to successfully model percent tree-canopy cover (PTCC). Creating model II regression mosaics, however, is a time-consuming, manual process. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of using more easily automated image composites techniques, such as median Landsat-5 image composites or maximumNDVILandsat-5 image composites, as alternatives to model II regression mosaics for the modeling ofPTCC. This study found all composite types were effective in modelingPTCC, but the maximumNDVIcomposites included anomalies, clouds, shadows, and tended to be pixelated, whereas the median composites and the model II regression mosaics had none of these issues. The median composite procedure is automated and was found to be an effective approach to statistically reduce a much larger ensemble of images on a pixel basis to create images suitable for vegetation modeling.

                Most of the feature selection (FS) methods in the literature determine features that are appropriate only for a given dataset. In contrast, in this paper aFSmethod that is not dependent to a specific dataset is proposed. In this regard, the effective feature types based on reasonable facts are predefined and appropriate candidate features for each feature type are selected. In proposed method, the features selected from a single labeled image can be used in segmentation of images captured by different satellites with similar spatial resolution. The selected feature types contain spatial and spectral features. The selected features are applied for segmentation of the images captured by QuickBird and GeoEye satellites and obtained results of proposed method are compared with well-knownFSmethods. Using different evaluation measures, our comparison shows the efficiency of the proposed method in providing better segmentation compared to otherFSmethods that are presented in this paper.

                Identifying submerged objects is critical for several disciplines such as marine archaeology and search and rescue. However, identifying objects in underwater searches presents many challenges, particularly if the only data available to analyze is poor-quality video where the videographer did not plan for photogrammetric techniques to be utilized. In this paper, we discuss the use of adaptive sampling of the underwater video to extract sharp still images for stitching and analysis, and creating mosaicked images by identifying and matching local scale-invariant feature transform features using computationally efficient algorithms. Computer aided design models of suspected aircraft components were superimposed, and a feature common in multiple mosaicked images was used to identify a common feature between purported objects to assess goodness of fit. The superimposition method was replicated using landing gear from a reference aircraft and a rope of known dimensions, and favorably compared against the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) analysis results.
