                HDF-EOS is the standard format for NASA’s EOS data products. Data stored in the HDF-EOS swath structure are in a raw sensor coordinate system and are not rectified to a map projection or geographic coordinate system. The geolocation information is stored as separate fields in a swath. Swath data have to be georectified before they can be integrated and analyzed. Presently, no general purpose remote sensing image processing or geographic information system software has the capability to directly perform georectification of HDF-EOS swath data by using the geolocation information in the file. Most software cannot even import such data due to the relevant newness of the format, and this has limited the public use of NASA EOS data products. This paper describes algorithms that automatically georectify the swath data by using the geolocation information in the swath. The algorithms have been implemented in a software package which is freely available to data users.

                Site-specific accuracy assessments evaluate fine-scale accuracy of land-use/land-cover (LULC) datasets but provide little insight into accuracy of area estimates of LULC classes derived from sampling units of varying size. Additionally, accuracy of landscape structure metrics calculated from area estimates cannot be determined solely from site-specific assessments. We used LULC data from Rhode Island and Massachusetts as reference to determine the accuracy of area measurements from the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) within spatial units ranging from 0.1 to 200 km2. When regressed on reference area, NLCD area of developed land, agriculture, forest, and water had positive linear relationships with high r2, suggesting acceptable accuracy. However, many of these classes also displayed mean differences (NLCD REFERENCE), and linear relationships between the NLCD and reference were not one-to-one (i.e., low r2, β0≠ 0, β1≠ 1), suggesting mapped area is different from true area. Rangeland, wetland, and barren were consistently, poorly classified.

                Most models of forest type for predictive mapping cannot produce estimates of confidence in the prediction of individual pixels, even where they provide good overall accuracy. A new strategy that combines several models based on different principles not only provides estimates of prediction confidence, but also improves the mapping accuracy. In this study, the theoretical foundation of Artificial Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and Dempster-Shafer’s Evidence Theory are briefly reviewed, compared, and applied to a common data set. Two ways for integrating the results of the three models were then evaluated. One method was to separately harden the probability results of the three models, then combine them to make a single classification. In the second method, the probabilities of the three models for each pixel were simply averaged, then hardened to a single classification. Deferring the hardening to the final stage produced the best results. The 3 percent increase in overall accuracy for the second approach compared with the best individual model is encouraging. More importantly, estimates of prediction confidence were derived, based on a comparison between a combined model and the three models, something that is impossible using a single model.

            An Initial Study on Automatic Reconstruction of Ground DEMs from Airborne IfSAR DSMs

                The demands for ground digital elevation models (DEMs) have been increasing rapidly. Many modern mapping technologies, such as lidar scanning, interferometric SAR (IfSAR), and stereo image matching, are capable of generating digital surface models (DSMs) directly. Research on deriving DEMs from DSMs is a topical area. Airborne IfSAR technology has been in commercial operation since 1996. However, it is still technically challenging to automate the process of generating DEMs from IfSAR DSMs. The lack of scientific studies in this area is mainly caused by the sensitivity and availability of commercial IfSAR data. In this study, researchers have been working with the commercial IfSAR system developer to perform an initial study on automatic reconstruction of ground DEMs from IfSAR DSMs. This paper presents a compact and yet efficient version of our developed approach. This approach has been tested by using many IfSAR DSMs in different hilly urban areas with light and moderate variations in relief. An accuracy analysis of the reconstructed ground DEMs against the laser DSMs and DEMs has also been performed to test the reliability and efficiency of our approach.

            The Characteristics and Interpretability of Land Surface Change and Implications for Project Design

                The need for comprehensive, accurate information on land-cover change has never been greater. While remotely sensed imagery affords the opportunity to provide information on land-cover change over large geographic expanses at a relatively low cost, the characteristics of land-surface change bring into question the suitability of many commonly used methodologies. Algorithm-based methodologies to detect change generally cannot provide the same level of accuracy as the analyses done by human interpreters. Results from the Land Cover Trends project, a cooperative venture that includes the U.S. Geological Survey, Environmental Protection Agency, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration, have shown that land-cover conversion is a relatively rare event, occurs locally in small patches, varies geographically and temporally, and is spectrally ambiguous. Based on these characteristics of change and the type of information required, manual interpretation was selected as the primary means of detecting change in the Land Cover Trends project. Mixtures of algorithm-based detection and manual interpretation may often prove to be the most feasible and appropriate design for change-detection applications. Serious examination of the expected characteristics and measurability of change must be considered during the design and implementation phase of any change analysis project.

            Validation and Calibration of Canada-Wide Coarse-Resolution Satellite Burned-Area Maps

                Satellite-based mapping can provide a timely and efficient means of identifying burned vegetation at continental scales for estimating greenhouse gas emissions and impacts on the terrestrial carbon budget. In this study, we used a sample of 55 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes distributed across Canada to validate and calibrate 1998 and 1999 national-level burned areas maps produced using coarse resolution (approx. 1-km) SPOT VEGETATION and NOAA AVHRR imagery. Commission and omissions errors, based on fire events greater than 200 ha, were found to be small in the coarse resolution maps (4 percent and 1 percent, respectively). However, the coarse resolution burned-area estimates were 72 percent larger than the crown fire burned area mapped at 30 m using Landsat TM (11,039 versus 6,403 ha average area). This bias was attributed to spatial aggregation effects in which the coarse resolution product included the tree crown fire, partial burn, and unburned fractions of a pixel. A regression calibration model (R20.95, p < 0.0005, RMSE = 3,015 ha, n = 155) based on a VGT/TM double sampling approach was derived to correct for the aggregation bias and to provide Canada-wide estimates of crown fire burned area.

                A new method called Derivation and Threshold Approach (DATA) was developed to estimate the onset of vegetation green-up (OVG) for the Mongolian Plateau from 1982 to 1990. The estimates of OVG date were highly correlated with geographic patterns and climatic variations across time and space within our study area. The date of OVG was earliest for the forest and meadow steppe, later for the typical steppe, and latest for the desert steppe. Our findings also showed that ecosystems in the Mongolian Plateau exhibited high spa-tiotemporal variability in the date of OVG during the study period. The date of onset was found to be most consistent for the forest ecosystem, while the desert steppe was characterized by high year-to-year variations in onset date. A comparison of the derived OVG date estimates with meteorological data showed a clear linkage between onset date and the beginning of spring precipitation in the dry region of the Mongolian Plateau.

                The demands for ground digital elevation models (DEMs) have been increasing rapidly. Many modern mapping technologies, such as lidar scanning, interferometric SAR (IfSAR), and stereo image matching, are capable of generating digital surface models (DSMs) directly. Research on deriving DEMs from DSMs is a topical area. Airborne IfSAR technology has been in commercial operation since 1996. However, it is still technically challenging to automate the process of generating DEMs from IfSAR DSMs. The lack of scientific studies in this area is mainly caused by the sensitivity and availability of commercial IfSAR data. In this study, researchers have been working with the commercial IfSAR system developer to perform an initial study on automatic reconstruction of ground DEMs from IfSAR DSMs. This paper presents a compact and yet efficient version of our developed approach. This approach has been tested by using many IfSAR DSMs in different hilly urban areas with light and moderate variations in relief. An accuracy analysis of the reconstructed ground DEMs against the laser DSMs and DEMs has also been performed to test the reliability and efficiency of our approach.

                The need for comprehensive, accurate information on land-cover change has never been greater. While remotely sensed imagery affords the opportunity to provide information on land-cover change over large geographic expanses at a relatively low cost, the characteristics of land-surface change bring into question the suitability of many commonly used methodologies. Algorithm-based methodologies to detect change generally cannot provide the same level of accuracy as the analyses done by human interpreters. Results from the Land Cover Trends project, a cooperative venture that includes the U.S. Geological Survey, Environmental Protection Agency, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration, have shown that land-cover conversion is a relatively rare event, occurs locally in small patches, varies geographically and temporally, and is spectrally ambiguous. Based on these characteristics of change and the type of information required, manual interpretation was selected as the primary means of detecting change in the Land Cover Trends project. Mixtures of algorithm-based detection and manual interpretation may often prove to be the most feasible and appropriate design for change-detection applications. Serious examination of the expected characteristics and measurability of change must be considered during the design and implementation phase of any change analysis project.

            Validation and Calibration of Canada-Wide Coarse-Resolution Satellite Burned-Area Maps

                Satellite-based mapping can provide a timely and efficient means of identifying burned vegetation at continental scales for estimating greenhouse gas emissions and impacts on the terrestrial carbon budget. In this study, we used a sample of 55 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes distributed across Canada to validate and calibrate 1998 and 1999 national-level burned areas maps produced using coarse resolution (approx. 1-km) SPOT VEGETATION and NOAA AVHRR imagery. Commission and omissions errors, based on fire events greater than 200 ha, were found to be small in the coarse resolution maps (4 percent and 1 percent, respectively). However, the coarse resolution burned-area estimates were 72 percent larger than the crown fire burned area mapped at 30 m using Landsat TM (11,039 versus 6,403 ha average area). This bias was attributed to spatial aggregation effects in which the coarse resolution product included the tree crown fire, partial burn, and unburned fractions of a pixel. A regression calibration model (R20.95, p < 0.0005, RMSE = 3,015 ha, n = 155) based on a VGT/TM double sampling approach was derived to correct for the aggregation bias and to provide Canada-wide estimates of crown fire burned area.

                A new method called Derivation and Threshold Approach (DATA) was developed to estimate the onset of vegetation green-up (OVG) for the Mongolian Plateau from 1982 to 1990. The estimates of OVG date were highly correlated with geographic patterns and climatic variations across time and space within our study area. The date of OVG was earliest for the forest and meadow steppe, later for the typical steppe, and latest for the desert steppe. Our findings also showed that ecosystems in the Mongolian Plateau exhibited high spa-tiotemporal variability in the date of OVG during the study period. The date of onset was found to be most consistent for the forest ecosystem, while the desert steppe was characterized by high year-to-year variations in onset date. A comparison of the derived OVG date estimates with meteorological data showed a clear linkage between onset date and the beginning of spring precipitation in the dry region of the Mongolian Plateau.
