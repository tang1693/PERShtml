                The paper provides an account of how three key relief organizations worked together after the devastating Haiti earthquake to produce the first damage assessment based mainly on the use of remotely-sensed imagery. This assessment was jointly conducted by the World Bank (WB), the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) Operational Satellite Applications Programme (UNOSAT), and the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC). This paper discusses the data sources used for the assessment, the methodologies employed to evaluate building damage, and a set of independent studies to validate the final damage results. Finally, a vision of the role of remote sensing technologies in future disasters is presented that serves as a road map for methodological improvements.

                This paper uses GeoEye-1 imagery and airborne lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) data to map buildings and their rubble in Port-au-Prince caused by the Haiti earthquake on 12 January 2010. This is achieved by performing an object-based one-class-at-a-time land cover classification of the image and lidar data using spectral, textural and height information. Classification accuracy is about 87 percent overall, and approximately 80 percent for buildings and rubble. Comparison of manually-selected 200 actual damaged buildings within an area of two sq. km in the city center shows an accuracy of over 90 percent for building and rubble mapping. 3D building models for approximately 55,000 buildings covering an area of 30 sq. km over Port-au-Prince were generated. It is found that most of the damage is to the concrete and masonry structures in the well planned areas of the city and very little damage to the shelters and the temporary type houses with metal sheet roofs. The study demonstrates that fusing optical imagery and lidar data can effectively map the nature, severity, extent and damage patterns caused by earthquakes in densely populated urban areas like Port-au-Prince.

                Remote sensing technology is a powerful tool to extract regions damaged after an earthquake. There are two methodological approaches in detection of earthquake damage: mono-temporal and multi-temporal. Especially for providing effective emergency management, the mono-temporal approach is generally preferred in extraction of earthquake damage as it does not depend on availability of pre-earthquake imagery. For this purpose, a novel method called support vector selection and adaptation (SVSA) has been introduced to detect the damaged regions from a post-earthquake image. In this study, the SVSA method was applied to the region where the Haiti Presidential Palace and Cathedral is located, and the damaged regions were identified. The performance of the SVSA method in identification of the damaged regions was evaluated by comparing the thematic maps obtained by classifying pre- and post-earthquake images. Additionally, the damage patterns for the city of Port-au-Prince were estimated by the SVSA.

                In recent years, a number of destructive earthquakes took place around the world. Earth Observation (EO)-based damage assessment was among the tools used to coordinate relief efforts; most of the published maps, however, are still based on weather-dependent optical data and visual interpretation. Only recently, methods based on radar data began to emerge, although not yet consolidated. In this paper we elaborate on a method for damage assessment on urban areas set up on the occasion of the 2008 Sichuan event and refined on the 2009 L’Aquila earthquake; direct investigation of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, providing an even larger statistical base thanks to the extent of the Port-au-Prince urban area, allowed pinpointing some characteristic behaviors potentially useful to improve damage assessment results. In particular, we note how results changed thanks to a more reliable and accurate revision of reference data and outline a possible starting point for correction of damage over/underestimation. Quantitative results are provided.

                The Haiti earthquake produced a big effort in the remote sensing data collection. Many international surveying organizations were involved to collect, process, and use the spatial information to rescue the population. Here, a change detection methodology based on landscape metrics, derived by the landscape ecology and implemented in FRAGSTAST software is presented. Some of these metrics were applied to Pre-event and Post-event classified images (QuickBird and Ikonos). The attention was focused on ten test areas, characterized by different spatial patterns and urban structures. The land-cover classification (Urban and Other) was provided by an unsupervised K-Means algorithm in ILWIS open source software. The final results and their temporal comparison have allowed localization of the earthquake damages and the occurred changes, and also analyzing the fragmentation of the urban morphology. The GIS management of the information has improved the thematic map production, with useful results very for damage assessment.

                In this paper, a novel method for detecting earthquake damage to urban road networks using very high resolution (VHR) satellite images is proposed. The study focuses on road blockage caused by rubble from collapsed buildings. The road regions were first extracted from a pre-event road map. The damage to the road network was then detected from the post-event VHR image of the road regions using object-based classification, where both spectral and texture information was used. The damage to adjacent buildings was also extracted and used to refine the initial result of the road damage detection. The proposed method was evaluated using bitemporal VHR images and the road map of Port au Prince, Haiti, which was heavily hit by an earthquake in January 2010. The experimental results showed that the proposed method outperformed the direct use of various data combinations in road damage detection and achieved the best performance, with an overall accuracy (OA) of 81.50 percent and a Kappa coefficient of 61.23 percent. In particular, when the refinement step with building damage information in the area adjacent to the road was applied, the OA and Kappa were significantly improved.
