                This paper presents the initial results of lander and rover localization and topographic mapping of the MER 2003 mission (by Sol 225 for Spirit and Sol 206 for Opportunity). The Spirit rover has traversed a distance of 3.2 km (actual distance traveled instead of odometry) and Opportunity at 1.2 km. We localized the landers in the Gusev Crater and on the Meridiani Planum using two-way Doppler radio positioning technology and cartographic triangulations through landmarks visible in both orbital and ground images. Additional high-resolution orbital images were taken to verify the determined lander positions. Visual odometry and bundleadjustment technologies were applied to overcome wheel slippages, azimuthal angle drift and other navigation errors (as large as 21 percent). We generated timely topographic products including 68 orthophoto maps and 3D Digital Terrain Models, eight horizontal rover traverse maps, vertical traverse profiles up to Sol 214 for Spirit and Sol 62 for Opportunity, and five 3D crater models. A web-based landing-site Geographic Information System (GIS) has been set up at The Ohio State University to update and disseminate the daily localization and topographic information to support tactical and strategic operations of the mission. Also described in this paper are applications of the data for science operations planning, geological traverse survey, survey of windrelated features, and other science applications. The majority of the instruments onboard both rovers are healthy at this moment, and they will continue to explore the two landing sites on the Martian surface. We expect to report further localization and topographic mapping results to be achieved in the rest of the mission period and in post-mission data processing.

                Automated procedures for ground processing of Mars Express HRSC data have been developed and are applied systematically immediately after download in order to provide calibrated data sets as well as photogrammetric image and 3D data products within a short time frame. Multi-spectral orthoimages in scales of 10 m to 50 m/pixel and digital terrain models of 200 m raster width are generated within days even for large orbits covering areas of several hundred thousand square kilometers. An even higher image resolution of up to 2.3 m/pixel provided by HRSC’s Super Resolution Channel (SRC) extends the potential of the HRSC camera experiment.

                The High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) on the European spacecraft Mars Express is the first camera on a planetary mission especially designed for photogrammetric and cartographic purposes. Since January 2004 the camera has been taking image data from the Martian surface, characterized by high-resolution, stereo capability and color. These data provide an enormous potential for the generation of 3D surface models, color orthoimages, topographic and thematic maps, and additional products. The image data acquired undergo calibration and systematic processing to orthoimages and 3D data products. Within the international HRSC Science Team the members of the Photogrammetric/Cartographic Working Group are concerned with further refinements in order to achieve highest quality data products. These activities comprise improvements of the exterior orientation of the camera, various approaches to enhance DTM quality, and the generation of maps in the standard scale of 1:200 000 and larger scales as well. The paper reports on these activities and the results achieved so far.

                Analysis of data combining daytime visible reflected, daytime IR emitted, and nighttimeIRemitted images allows us to isolate the physical effects of topography, albedo, and thermal inertia. To a good approximation, these physical influences interact linearly so that maps showing topographic shading, albedo, and relative thermal inertia can be produced by simple algebraic manipulation of the co-registered images. The shading map resembles an airbrush, shaded relief portrayal of the surface, and can be used as the input for quantitative reconstruction of topography by photoclinometry (shape-fromshading). We demonstrate the method with imagery from theNASA 2001Mars Odyssey Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS), a dataset that could support mapping most of Mars in this way at 100 m resolution.

                Aboard Mars Global Surveyor (MGS), the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) collects accurate laser altimetry data over the Martian surface, while the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) acquires high resolution images. Recent studies have found that certain systematic misregistration exists among these two types of data due to a number of causes. In this research, a combined adjustment is proposed to correct such misregistration and accurately determine ground positions. Primary participants in this process are MOLA ranges and MOLA ground points, MOC image orientation data, and tie points collected from the MOC Narrow Angle (NA) stereo images. It is shown that the combined adjustment is very beneficial when the trajectory data has a large inconsistency. The outcome is the refined MOC image orientation and refined ground positions, which are validated by the improved MOC and MOLA registration as an independent evaluation. The theoretic study shows the ground position precision of the combined adjustment varies from 28 to 178 meters, depending on the quality of the trajectory data.

                This paper reports on mapping procedures developed by the U.S. Geological Survey that use Viking Orbiter imagery and Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) derived radii to produce topographic data. The use of Mosaiced Digital Image Models (MDIMs), created from Viking Orbiter images, andMOLAdata to provide horizontal and vertical control is reviewed. We describe procedures to adapt a commercial digital photogrammetric workstation to work with planetary data.

                A pinpoint landing capability will be a critical component for many planned NASA missions to Mars and beyond. Implicit in the requirement is the ability to accurately localize the spacecraft with respect to the terrain during descent. In this paper, we present evidence that a vision-based solution using craters as landmarks is both practical and will meet the requirements of next generation missions. Our emphasis in this paper is on the feasibility of such a system in terms of (a) localization accuracy and (b) applicability to Martian terrain. We show that accuracy of well under 100 meters can be expected under suitable conditions. We also present a sensitivity analysis that makes an explicit connection between input data and robustness of our pose estimate. In addition, we present an analysis of the susceptibility of our technique to inherently ambiguous configurations of craters. We show that probability of failure due to such ambiguity is becoming increasingly small.

                An automated crater detection algorithm is presented which exploits image data. The algorithm is briefly described and its application demonstrated on a variety of different Martian geomorphological areas and sensors (Viking Orbiter Camera, Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC), Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA), and High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC)). We show assessment results through both an intercomparison of automated crater locations with those from the manually-derived Mars Crater Consortium (MCC) catalogue and the manually-derived craters. The detection algorithm attains an accuracy of 70 to 90 percent and a quality factor of 60 to 80 percent depending on target sensor type and geomorphology. We also present crater detection results derived from HRSC images onboard the ESA Mars Express on a comparison between manually-determined Size-Frequency Distributions (SFDs) and those derived fully automatically. The approach described appears to offer great potential for chronological research, geomatic and geological analysis and for other purposes of extra-terrestrial planetary surface mapping.

                Geologists explore the Earth at specific surface locations and then integrate these data using more synoptic approaches. Planetary geoscientists, however, are forced by the nature of the available data to start from synoptic and orbital data and work down toward the surface. We describe Advanced Visualization in Solar System Exploration and Research (ADVISER), a problem-solving environment that uses advanced visualization techniques to bridge an important gap between the cartographic data sets derived by remote sensing and their application in geoscientific research. ADVISER integrates and extends state-of-the-art hardware and software technologies into a set of tools that provide the planetary geoscientist with the capability to operate and analyze data and to undertake mapping as if they were on or near the surface of a planet. Application of these tools (e.g., virtual field tools and notebook) to analysis of the north polar-layered terrain on Mars provides insight into polar cap formation and evolution and mission planning activities.
