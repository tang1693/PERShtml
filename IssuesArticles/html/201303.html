                Terrestrial lidar (TLS) is an emerging technology for deriving forest attributes, including conventional inventory and canopy characterizations. However, little is known about the influence of scanner specifications on derived forest parameters. We compared two TLS systems at two sites in British Columbia. Common scanning benchmarks and identical algorithms were used to obtain estimates of tree diameter, position, and canopy characteristics. Visualization of range images and point clouds showed clear differences, even though both scanners were relatively high-resolution instruments. These translated into quantifiable differences in impulse penetration, characterization of stems and crowns far from the scan location, and gap fraction. Differences between scanners in estimates of effective plant area index were greater than differences between sites. Both scanners provided a detailed digital model of forest structure, and gross structural characterizations (including crown dimensions and position) were relatively robust; but comparison of canopy density metrics may require consideration of scanner attributes.

                A hybrid object-based change detection (OBCD) method incorporating a hierarchical image segmentation strategy and cross-correlation analysis (CCA) is described and demonstrated. The proposed hybrid OBCD method was used to update an existing thematic map derived from Landsat-5 and -7 imagery (circa 2000), with imagery consisting of markedly different sensor specifications (Landsat-2, circa 1976). The proposed hierarchical image segmentation strategy successfully constrained change objects within existing land cover boundaries, avoiding the production of “sliver objects,” an issue related to other image segmentation strategies used in OBCD. In combination with the CCA method, the hybrid OBCD method is capable of generating change thresholds for individual land-cover classes, providing a mechanism to limit the amount of spurious change detected. Two change threshold methods were tested: (a) change threshold values based on two standard deviations, and, (b) an unsupervised threshold method. No statistically significant difference was found between these threshold methods.

            A Spatial-Spectral Methodology to Detect Narrow Shadows on Satellite Imagery

                Image shadow is an important mono-scope cue in the detection and characterization of buildings from aerial and satellite imagery. Previous studies have confirmed the effectiveness of radiometric thresholding in delineating shadows cast by tall buildings on high resolution (≤1m) imagery. Thresholding is not effective when shadow width is comparable to the imaging sensor resolution since mixed shadow/illuminated pixels do not exhibit a distinct radiometric character. A spatial-spectral shadow detection method is proposed that exploits the line-like and low radiance characteristics of shadows cast by large area commercial/industrial buildings commonly found in suburban areas of large cities. Tests conducted in shadow detection of such buildings in Calgary, Alberta using RapidEye imagery indicate that detectability rates of ~80 percent can be achieved although commission errors are significant because of the plethora of other line-like features present in industrial park settings.

            Land Cover Dependent Error in Intermap IFSAR DTM

                Elevation error in the Intermap X-band airborne Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar DTM data set is defined in a 260-hectare mixed land-cover area using external dual-frequency GPS and bare-earth lidar point-cloud validation data. Absolute elevation error is reported globally, and within land-cover classes characterized by distinctive vegetation canopy densities and depths that are considered to have the potential to affect X-band DTM elevation error in distinctive ways. Observed global and land-cover specific elevation errors are subsequently compared with an external study where land-cover dependent errors were quantified within four lidar data sets that overlapped the IFSAR DTM validation area. The results of these absolute and comparative results are subsequently used to make recommendations regarding the potential of Intermap bare-earth IFSAR DTM data in environmental modeling applications elsewhere, and the scope for using the data in conjunction with, and as an alternative to airborne lidar data is discussed.

                Nighttime satellite imagery from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System (OLS) has a unique capability to observe nocturnal light emissions from sources including cities, wild fires, and gas flares. Data from the DMSP OLS is used in a wide range of studies including mapping urban areas, estimating informal economies, and estimations of population. Given the extensive and increasing list of applications a repeatable method for assessing geolocation accuracy would be beneficial. An array of portable lights was designed and taken to multiple field sites known to have no other light sources. The lights were operated during nighttime overpasses by the DMSP OLS and observed in the imagery. An assessment of the geolocation accuracy was performed by measuring the distance between the GPS measured location of the lights and the observed location in the imagery. A systematic shift was observed and the mean distance was measured at 2.9 km.

            Photogrammetric Techniques for the Determination of Spatio-temporal Velocity Fields at Glaciar San Rafael, Chile

                Glaciar San Rafael in the Northern Patagonia Icefield, with a length of 46 km and an ice area of 722 km2, is the lowest latitude tidewater outlet glacier in the world and one of the fastest and most productive glaciers in southern South America in terms of iceberg flux. Spatio-temporal velocity fields in the region of the glacier front were determined from monoscopic terrestrial image sequences recorded by an inter-vallometer mode high-resolution digital camera over several days. In these image sequences, a large number of glacier surface points were tracked by subpixel accuracy feature tracking techniques. Scaling and georeferencing of the trajectories obtained from image space tracking was performed using a multi-station GPS-supported photogrammetric network. The technique allows for tracking hundreds of glacier surface points at a measurement accuracy in the order of one decimeter, for typical glacier movement rates, and an almost arbitrarily high temporal resolution. The results show velocities of up to 16 meters per day.
