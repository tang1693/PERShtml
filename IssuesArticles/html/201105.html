                Accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) is difficult to obtain over heterogeneous landscapes presenting spectrally diverse land covers and topographic terrains. The goal of this study is to build advanced remote sensing and surface energy balance algorithms to map ET in a heterogeneous semi-arid area. ET of 12 different land covers is computed by applying the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) modified for roughness, vegetation index, and topographic-corrected reflectance, with comparison to the JIC model. A GIS raster/vector platform is used to integrate multispectral thermal and reflectance imagery with meteorological, terrain, land-cover, and astronomical data. SEBAL computed with all the modifications showed the best agreement with the ground measurements, compared to the SEBAL versions without any single modification, and it could significantly discriminate ET among 75.8 percent of vegetation types (at threshold differences in ET >0.5 mm/day). SEBAL without any modifications could not discriminate any vegetation types.

                As part of the ongoing activities for the European space mission BepiColombo to Mercury, a new stereo-matching algorithm is here proposed: this algorithm uses deformable surfaces, or snakes, to find a dense disparity map. Subject to both external and internal forces, respectively represented by the similarity function and by smoothness constraints on the disparity map, a “deformable” disparity map evolves from an initial approximate state to an optimal one in which the algorithm has reached convergence.This algorithm is expected to provide one of the image matching tools for the Digital Terrain Model generation procedure that will be used by the BepiColombo stereo camera. To check the algorithm, tests have been performed on synthetic images derived from3Dmodels of geological features relevant to planetary science. The results show that it is possible to obtain an image measurement accuracy comparable to the one attainable with the Least Squares Matching algorithm. In addition, less object smoothing can be obtained since the object points are not derived by a large scale averaging over a terrain patch, as for example, in area-based methods; this means that more details of the terrain can be captured. Finally, because of the continuity constraint, this method is also expected to be robust in case of blunders in the reconstruction of the parallax field.

            An Approach to Lineament Analysis for Groundwater Exploration in Nicaragua

                Wells in bedrock aquifers tend to yield more water where they intersect fracture networks. Lineament analysis using satellite imagery was employed to identify surface expressions of subsurface fracturing for possible new well locations. An imagery integration approach was developed to evaluate satellite imagery for lineament analysis in terrain where the influences of human development and vegetation confound lineament interpretation. Four satellite sensors (ASTER, Landsat-7 ETM+, QuickBird, RADARSAT-1) and a DEM were used for lineament mapping a volcanic region of Nicaragua. Image processing and interpretations obtained 12 complementary products, which were synthesized into a raster image of lineament-zone coincidence for creating a lineament delineation map. Nine of the 11 previously mapped faults were identified from the coincidence-based map along with 26 new lineaments. The locations of ten new lineaments were confirmed by field observation. RADARSAT-1 products were best for minimizing anthropogenic features but not able to identify all the geological lineaments.

                The height and shape of shrub canopies are critical measurements for characterizing shrub steppe rangelands. Remote sensing technologies might provide an efficient method to acquire these measurements across large areas. This study compared point-cloud and rasterized lidar data to field-measured sagebrush height and shape to quantify the correlation between field-based and lidar-derived estimates. The results demonstrated that discrete return, small-footprint lidar with high point density (9.46 points/m2) can provide strong predictions of true sagebrush height (R2of 0.84 to 0.86), but with a consistent underestimation of approximately 30 percent. Our results provided the first successful lidar-based descriptors of sagebrush shape with R2values of 0.65, 0.74, and 0.78 for respective predictions of shortest canopy diameter, longest canopy diameter, and canopy area. Future studies can extend lidar-derived shrub height and shape measurements to canopy volume, cover, and biomass estimates.

                Self-calibration is a powerful technique to exploit the geometric potential of optical spaceborne sensors. This paper explains the methodology of expanding a sensor model for in-orbit geometric calibration of the PRISM radiometers on the Japanese ALOS satellite. PRISM has three optical systems for forward, nadir, and backward views each with a 2.5 m nominal spatial resolution. Algorithms for the geometric processing of the PRISM images are proposed and implemented. It is shown how self calibration and orientation of the sensor can be done without having precise knowledge of the payload geometry and attitude data. Several cases and procedures are studied with the established sensor model, including weight matrices, attitude offsets, attitude drifts, and focal length estimations. It is concluded that self calibration of the PRISM cameras can be done effectively with a rigorous sensor model. Even if the post-launch parameters are not available, sub-pixel geometric accuracy can be achieved.
