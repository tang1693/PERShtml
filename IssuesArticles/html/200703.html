                Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (INSAR) is capable of measuring ground-surface deformation with centimeter-tosubcentimeter precision and spatial resolution of tens-of meters over a relatively large region. With its global coverage and all-weather imaging capability, INSAR is an important technique for measuring ground-surface deformation of volcanoes over cloud-prone and rainy regions such as the Aleutian Islands, where only less than 5 percent of optical imagery is usable due to inclement weather conditions. The spatial distribution of surface deformation data, derived from INSAR images, enables the construction of detailed mechanical models to enhance the study of magmatic processes. This paper reviews the basics of INSAR for volcanic deformation mapping and the INSAR studies of ten Aleutian volcanoes associated with both eruptive and noneruptive activity. These studies demonstrate that all-weather INSAR imaging can improve our understanding of how the Aleutian volcanoes work and enhance our capability to predict future eruptions and associated hazards.

                Ground subsidence due to underground mining has posed a constant threat to the safety of surface infrastructure such as motorways, railways, power lines, and telecommunications cables. Traditional monitoring techniques like using levels, total stations and GPS can only measure on a point-by-point basis and hence are costly and time-consuming. Differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DINSAR) together with GPS and GIS have been studied as a complementary alternative by exploiting multi-source satellite SAR images over a mining site southwest of Sydney.Digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from ERS-1 and ERS-2 tandem images, photogrammetry, airborne laser scanning, and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission were assessed based on ground survey data using levelling as well as GPS-RTK. The identified high quality DEM was then used in the DINSAR analysis. Repeat-pass acquisitions by the ERS-1, ERS-2, JERS-1, RADARSAT-1 and ENVISAT satellites were used to monitor mine subsidence in the region with seven active mine collieries. Sub-centimeter accuracy has been demonstrated by comparing DINSAR results against ground survey profiles. The ERS tandem DINSAR results revealed mm-level resolution.

            Study of Rain Events over the South China Sea by Synergistic Use of Multi-sensor Satellite and Ground-based Meteorological Data

                Rain cells and rain bands over the South China Sea off the coast of Hong Kong are studied by using multi-sensor satellite and ground-based meteorological data. These include synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired by the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) onboard the European ENVISAT satellite, weather radar images from the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO), rain rate data acquired by the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) sensor onboard the F15 satellite of the American Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) and the rain sensors onboard the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) satellite, cloud image of GOES-9 satellite, sea surface wind maps acquired by the scatterometer onboard the QUIKSCAT satellite, and meteorological data from weather stations in Hong Kong. Three rain events, typical of Hong Kong, are studied. The first event consists of a cluster of rain cells associated with the summer monsoon, the second one of rain cells aligned in a rain band generated by an upper-air trough, and the third one consists of small rain cells embedded in a cold front. It is shown that ASAR images, which have a resolution of 30 m in the Image Mode (IM) and 150 m resolution in the Wide Swath Mode (WSM), yield much more detailed information on the spatial structure of rain events over the ocean than data obtained from SSSM/I and the rain sensors onboard the TRMM satellite. The precipitation radar (PR) onboard TRMM, which is the rain measuring instrument flown in space with the next best resolution, has a resolution of only 4 km. However, the disadvantage of SAR is that it is sometimes difficult to identify SAR signatures visible on SAR images of the sea surface unambiguously as caused by rain events. By comparing SAR images with simultaneously acquired weather radar images of the Hong Kong Observatory, a better knowledge of radar signatures on SAR images resulting from rain events over the ocean is obtained. This knowledge then helps greatly in detecting rain events on SAR images which are acquired over ocean areas, which are not in the reach of weather radar stations. SAR images containing radar signature of rain events allow a much more detailed study of fine-scale structures of rain events over the World’s ocean, in particular of clusters of rain cells, than any other sensor presently flown in space.

                Agricultural crops classification capability of single band full polarization SAR data with different classification methods was evaluated using AIRSAR L-band polarimetric SAR data. It has been found that if only maximum likelihood (ML) classifiers, such as Wishart-maximum likelihood (WML) and normal distribution probability density functions (PDF)-based Maximum Likelihood (NML) classifier can be utilized, it is better to choose WML directly applied to complex coherency or covariance matrix. NML cannot achieve acceptable classification result if intensity and phase images derived from coherency matrix are directly used for training the classifier. But if these images were supplied to the spatial-spectral based classifier, Extraction and Classification of Homogenous Objects (ECHO), higher classification accuracy can be obtained. Very low crop types discrimination accuracy has been observed when only H-Alpha polarimetric decomposition resultant images, such as entropy, alpha and anisotropy, were supplied to NML or a spatial-spectral based classifier such as ECHO.

                It is important to determine quickly the extent of flooding during extreme cases. Even though SAR imagery with its own energy sources is highly applicable to flood monitoring owing to its sensitivity to the water area, topographic effects caused by local terrain relief must be carefully considered before the actual classification process. Since backscattering coefficients of the shadow area in high relief regions are very similar to those of the water area, it is essential to regard these areas before and after the classification procedure, although the process is a difficult and time-consuming task. In this study, efficient and economical methods for water area classification during floods in mountainous area are described. We tested five different cases using various synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image processing techniques, texture measures, and terrain shape information such as elevation and slope. The case whereby the SAR image was classified with the local slope information exhibited the best result for water area classification, even in small streams of different elevation categories. Consequently in mountainous areas, the combination of a SAR image and local slope information was the most appropriate method in estimating flooded areas.

            Comparisons of Compositing Period Length for Vegetation Index Data from Polar-orbiting and Geostationary Satellites for the Cloud-prone Region of West Africa

                Land surface data from MODIS and AVHRR have been extensively used for vegetation monitoring. In cloud-prone areas like West Africa the use of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data for vegetation monitoring is hampered by persistent cloud cover especially during the rainy season. The new geostationary satellite Meteosat Second Generation (SEVIRI MSG) is the first geostationary satellite suited for vegetation monitoring allowing NDVI to be derived with a 15-minute temporal resolution. For West Africa, MODIS (combined TERRA and AQUA) produce above 85 percent cloud-free pixels in the scene during the entire rainy season using 16-day composite periods. SEVIRI MSG data produces >98 percent cloud-free pixels during the entire season using a 3-day composite period. Therefore, there is a much higher probability for producing high quality cloud free data using SEVIRI MSG data for a short time composite period compared to Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite (POES) data, which is expected to substantially improve various applications of satellite based natural resource management, including vegetation monitoring, in West Africa.

                In this paper, we present a new approach combining canonical correlation analysis and contextual Bayes decision for change detection in bi-temporal multispectral remotely sensed images. Canonical correlation analysis in the form of Minimum Noise Fraction/Multivariate Alteration Detection transformation was first applied to two multispectral images to effectively yield a difference image, followed by a contextual Bayes decision procedure using automatic thresholding and Markov random field modeling techniques to identify areas where changes may have actually occurred from the difference image. An experiment of monitoring land reclamations in Hong Kong from Landsat TM/ETM+ images was conducted, and the results demonstrated effectiveness of our approach.

                In this paper, we evaluate the impacts of land-use/cover changes (LUCC) on sediment loads at the outlets of five sub-watersheds of the Poyang Lake watershed by integrating remote sensing and GIS with statistical analysis. The intensively farmed watershed is characterized by a mountainous and hilly topography and a rainy climate. The primary goal of this paper is to help a better understanding of land-use/cover change and its driving forces. We discuss spatio-temporal variations in rainfall and sediment loads and identify factors contributing to those variations, analyze the comprehensive impacts of land-use/cover change on changing climate and human activities, and conclude that the changing rates of forest cover and climate regimes are primary factors for sediment discharges in the Poyang Lake watershed. Our results suggest that the eco-system still have large capacities to support human activities in the area.

                Rain cells and rain bands over the South China Sea off the coast of Hong Kong are studied by using multi-sensor satellite and ground-based meteorological data. These include synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired by the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) onboard the European ENVISAT satellite, weather radar images from the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO), rain rate data acquired by the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) sensor onboard the F15 satellite of the American Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) and the rain sensors onboard the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) satellite, cloud image of GOES-9 satellite, sea surface wind maps acquired by the scatterometer onboard the QUIKSCAT satellite, and meteorological data from weather stations in Hong Kong. Three rain events, typical of Hong Kong, are studied. The first event consists of a cluster of rain cells associated with the summer monsoon, the second one of rain cells aligned in a rain band generated by an upper-air trough, and the third one consists of small rain cells embedded in a cold front. It is shown that ASAR images, which have a resolution of 30 m in the Image Mode (IM) and 150 m resolution in the Wide Swath Mode (WSM), yield much more detailed information on the spatial structure of rain events over the ocean than data obtained from SSSM/I and the rain sensors onboard the TRMM satellite. The precipitation radar (PR) onboard TRMM, which is the rain measuring instrument flown in space with the next best resolution, has a resolution of only 4 km. However, the disadvantage of SAR is that it is sometimes difficult to identify SAR signatures visible on SAR images of the sea surface unambiguously as caused by rain events. By comparing SAR images with simultaneously acquired weather radar images of the Hong Kong Observatory, a better knowledge of radar signatures on SAR images resulting from rain events over the ocean is obtained. This knowledge then helps greatly in detecting rain events on SAR images which are acquired over ocean areas, which are not in the reach of weather radar stations. SAR images containing radar signature of rain events allow a much more detailed study of fine-scale structures of rain events over the World’s ocean, in particular of clusters of rain cells, than any other sensor presently flown in space.

                Agricultural crops classification capability of single band full polarization SAR data with different classification methods was evaluated using AIRSAR L-band polarimetric SAR data. It has been found that if only maximum likelihood (ML) classifiers, such as Wishart-maximum likelihood (WML) and normal distribution probability density functions (PDF)-based Maximum Likelihood (NML) classifier can be utilized, it is better to choose WML directly applied to complex coherency or covariance matrix. NML cannot achieve acceptable classification result if intensity and phase images derived from coherency matrix are directly used for training the classifier. But if these images were supplied to the spatial-spectral based classifier, Extraction and Classification of Homogenous Objects (ECHO), higher classification accuracy can be obtained. Very low crop types discrimination accuracy has been observed when only H-Alpha polarimetric decomposition resultant images, such as entropy, alpha and anisotropy, were supplied to NML or a spatial-spectral based classifier such as ECHO.

                It is important to determine quickly the extent of flooding during extreme cases. Even though SAR imagery with its own energy sources is highly applicable to flood monitoring owing to its sensitivity to the water area, topographic effects caused by local terrain relief must be carefully considered before the actual classification process. Since backscattering coefficients of the shadow area in high relief regions are very similar to those of the water area, it is essential to regard these areas before and after the classification procedure, although the process is a difficult and time-consuming task. In this study, efficient and economical methods for water area classification during floods in mountainous area are described. We tested five different cases using various synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image processing techniques, texture measures, and terrain shape information such as elevation and slope. The case whereby the SAR image was classified with the local slope information exhibited the best result for water area classification, even in small streams of different elevation categories. Consequently in mountainous areas, the combination of a SAR image and local slope information was the most appropriate method in estimating flooded areas.

            Comparisons of Compositing Period Length for Vegetation Index Data from Polar-orbiting and Geostationary Satellites for the Cloud-prone Region of West Africa

                Land surface data from MODIS and AVHRR have been extensively used for vegetation monitoring. In cloud-prone areas like West Africa the use of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data for vegetation monitoring is hampered by persistent cloud cover especially during the rainy season. The new geostationary satellite Meteosat Second Generation (SEVIRI MSG) is the first geostationary satellite suited for vegetation monitoring allowing NDVI to be derived with a 15-minute temporal resolution. For West Africa, MODIS (combined TERRA and AQUA) produce above 85 percent cloud-free pixels in the scene during the entire rainy season using 16-day composite periods. SEVIRI MSG data produces >98 percent cloud-free pixels during the entire season using a 3-day composite period. Therefore, there is a much higher probability for producing high quality cloud free data using SEVIRI MSG data for a short time composite period compared to Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite (POES) data, which is expected to substantially improve various applications of satellite based natural resource management, including vegetation monitoring, in West Africa.

                In this paper, we present a new approach combining canonical correlation analysis and contextual Bayes decision for change detection in bi-temporal multispectral remotely sensed images. Canonical correlation analysis in the form of Minimum Noise Fraction/Multivariate Alteration Detection transformation was first applied to two multispectral images to effectively yield a difference image, followed by a contextual Bayes decision procedure using automatic thresholding and Markov random field modeling techniques to identify areas where changes may have actually occurred from the difference image. An experiment of monitoring land reclamations in Hong Kong from Landsat TM/ETM+ images was conducted, and the results demonstrated effectiveness of our approach.

                In this paper, we evaluate the impacts of land-use/cover changes (LUCC) on sediment loads at the outlets of five sub-watersheds of the Poyang Lake watershed by integrating remote sensing and GIS with statistical analysis. The intensively farmed watershed is characterized by a mountainous and hilly topography and a rainy climate. The primary goal of this paper is to help a better understanding of land-use/cover change and its driving forces. We discuss spatio-temporal variations in rainfall and sediment loads and identify factors contributing to those variations, analyze the comprehensive impacts of land-use/cover change on changing climate and human activities, and conclude that the changing rates of forest cover and climate regimes are primary factors for sediment discharges in the Poyang Lake watershed. Our results suggest that the eco-system still have large capacities to support human activities in the area.
