                Registration is an essential procedure for merging point clouds defined in different coordinate systems associated to different scanner positions and orientations. It is usually the first step before the point clouds are further processed to provide spatial information of a scene to support engineering applications. In this paper, a new automatic registration method based on a novel geometric model of a polygonal object is presented. Since the cross section of the shaft of many lamp poles is octagonal, registration based on an octagonal pyramid model is proposed. The presented method only requires a single, common octagonal lamp pole observed in both point clouds, though actual overlap of the point clouds is not strictly required. It can be performed as long as the model parameters can be estimated by fitting the point observations to the model. Moreover, no user interaction is needed to derive approximate values, so the proposed registration can be completely automated. Three independent datasets captured by two scanners were used to verify the method. The registration accuracies in the horizontal and vertical directions were up to 11.7 mm and 4.4 mm at approximately 62 m and 17 m away from the scanner, respectively. With such high accuracies, the estimated registration parameters can serve as a set of initial parameters for fine registration using algorithm such as the iterative closest point (ICP).

            Estimating Forest and Woodland Aboveground Biomass Using Active and Passive Remote Sensing

                Aboveground biomass was estimated from active and passive remote sensing sources, including airborne lidar and Landsat-8 satellites, in an eastern Arizona (USA) study area comprised of forest and woodland ecosystems. Compared to field measurements, airborne lidar enabled direct estimation of individual tree height with a slope of 0.98 (R2= 0.98). At the plot-level, lidar-derived height and intensity metrics provided the most robust estimate for aboveground biomass, producing dominant species-based aboveground models with errors ranging from 4 to 14Mg ha–1across all woodland and forest species. Landsat-8 imagery produced dominant species-based aboveground biomass models with errors ranging from 10 to 28Mg ha–1. Thus, airborne lidar allowed for estimates for fine-scale aboveground biomass mapping with low uncertainty, while Landsat-8 seems best suited for broader spatial scale products such as a national biomass essential climate variable (ECV) based on land cover types for the United States.

                Soil parameters such as water potential, temperature, organic matter (OM), and particle size distribution influence biological activity and collectively define the state of soils, yet these properties are typically described through time-intensive, ground-based sampling efforts. To improve our understanding of soils through stand-off sensing techniques, Light Detection and Ranging was used to monitor the signature of retroreflective beads embedded in polymeric agents on four soils. Our goal was to generate probability density functions (PDFs) for stochastic predictions of the persistence of this signature through time. Our findings showed that thePDFsof the reflected signal between target and background soils became nearly indistinguishable after five months and that OM, nitrogen content, cation exchange capacity, and pH related to signature decline. This approach, while developed using polymer-bound retroreflectors, will serve as a framework where a signature-emitter is left in or on soil and differentially influenced by terrain, weather, and soil processes.

            Combined Calibration Method Based on Rational Function Model for the Chinese GF-1 Wide-Field-of-View Imagery

                The internal geometric distortion of charge-coupled-device (CCD) chips degrades the internal geometric accuracy of satellite images. Even if a large number of ground control points (GCPs) are used for geometric correction, the satellite images cannot always be used for direct mapping. Because of the current lack of core parameters for building a rigorous geometric model, this paper proposes a combined interior-orientation calibration method based on the rational function model (RFM) for multipleGF-1wide-field-of-view (WFV) images of the same general scene. A polynomial model of look angles in the image space is chosen to compensate for the systemic error of CCD chips. After calibration for sensors 1 to 4, the orientation accuracy is improved to 0.4 pixels. Moreover, the residual error figures show no obvious trend. OtherGF-1WFV images are calibrated using the obtained interior-orientation parameters, and the improvement in their orientation accuracy is demonstrated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
