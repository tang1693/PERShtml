                The by-laws of many municipalities and local governments require certain level of public participation in their planning, decision-making processes. One of the common practices in Canada or elsewhere around the world is to hold public meetings, during which the proposed developments are explained and discussed, and public opinions are collected. The problems associated with existing practices are threefold: insufficient access to the information required for public input, lack of effective means of participation other than attending public meetings, and difficulties in explaining spatial concepts during the debate. Using the municipal environmental assessment (EA) process as the application context, this paper presents our effort on developing an integrated online GIS-enabled virtual public meeting space. The system provides a new way of engaging the public and addressing their concerns by facilitating information access, understanding of planning study, and proactive participation in public meetings and in overall municipal class EA process.

                Traditional analogue field methods are increasingly becoming a limiting factor in the workflow of computerized research projects. At the same time, the potential of mobile GIS and other mobile computing methods to support better and more efficient scientific data collection is widely acknowledged. There seems, however, to be little scientific proof for the added value and successful continuation of these methods beyond the pilot stage. In particular, the diversity and unique mobility characteristics of fieldwork pose specific difficulties for the design, implementation, and support of these methods. This paper offers a simpleex ante/ex postevaluation framework to help researchers in estimating the added value of a mobile computing method. The application of this framework is exemplified with an archaeological case study and demonstrates that its use can result in a more comprehensive view of the potential and actual benefits of applying specific mobile computing methods in scientific fieldwork.

                Information retrieval and intelligent search among heterogeneous data sources still continue to be challenging tasks. In this study, an attributed relational graph was employed to model the semantic information of heterogeneous geodata sources. Based on the attributed relational graphs, probabilistic relaxation was employed for pattern matching between different data sources. The initial probability and compatibility coefficients were calculated based on the combined evidence from semi-structured geodata sources and the characteristics of discrete and categorical variables. Experiments on automatic pattern matching were carried out and the results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach in element mapping between heterogeneous data sources.

                During the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) 2003 mission, the twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity have been sending immense amounts of valuable imagery and data to Earth, enabling scientists and engineers to find evidence of water on Mars and to conduct exciting Mars research. This paper presents the results of efforts made at the Mapping and GIS Laboratory of The Ohio State University (OSU) for the development and application of a web-based GIS, the OSU Mars WEBGIS, to support rover localization (i.e., position determination) and topographic mapping activities of the mission. Global and local spatial information and map products of the two landing sites are provided through the WEBGIS. The products include mosaics, orthophotos and digital terrain models (DTMs) derived from orbital and rover images; ground information is supplied as traverse maps, traverse profiles and 3D coordinates, slope maps, and energy index maps; analysis tools are also developed for effective visualization and exploration of the spatial information and products. The system has been successfully applied to the 2003 MER mission and has the potential for future Mars landed missions such as the 2009 Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission.

                This paper discusses the process of designing a spatial “knowledgebase” for infrastructure interdependency. Infrastructure interdependency is a new field of research that deals with interrelationships between critical infrastructure sectors in disaster management. The design and implementation of a spatial knowledgebase that mimics interrelationships between selected critical infrastructure sectors are conducted. This paper contributes to the field of disaster and emergency management by using a network-centric modeling approach and by implementing an infrastructure interdependency knowledgebase in a WEBGIS environment for effective decision-making process, using the historical scenario of Hurricane Hazel, the well-known hurricane in Canadian history that struck Toronto on 15 October 1954.

                Geospatial metadata, data, and services have been widely collected, developed and deployed in recent years. This flourishing of geospatial resources also added to the problem of geospatial heterogeneity. Interoperability research and implementation are needed for advancement in potential solutions to integrate and interoperate these widely dispersed geospatial resources. We propose the Spatial Web Portal architecture to integrate and interoperate geospatial resources. The architecture leverages web-based computing, spatial web services, and web fragments to integrate geospatial metadata, data, analysis, and presentation, through distributed portlets: (1) Spatial web services are adopted to interoperate geospatial components. (2) Web portals are adopted to integrate web pages from web fragments generated by portlets. (3) W3C recommendations are adopted to provide access to remote portlets delegating geospatial components. (4) Java community specifications are adopted to facilitate the development and distribution of portlets. NASA’ Earth Science Gateway (ESG) is designed and developed as an example to test the proposed architecture in sharing earth observations, simulations, and other geospatial resources. The proposed architecture and example system provide (a) a tested mechanism for interoperating geospatial resources at different levels, (b) an environment to test new interoperable concepts, and (c) a platform to support heterogeneous-geospatial-resource based applications of national and global significance, such as the Global Earth Observing System of Systems (GEOSS) applications.

                As geospatial catalogues are becoming accessible online through public query interfaces, a federation to fulfill distributed and integrated metadata discovery needs to be built. This study investigates the feasibility of federating three distinct geospatial catalogue services: the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) ClearingHOuse (ECHO), the George Mason University (GMU) OpenGIS Catalogue Service for Web (CSW), and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Earth System Grid (ESG) Simulation Data Catalogue. Challenges and problems in dealing with the metadata conceptual models, query languages, and communication protocols are analyzed. Proposed federation strategies and the operational federation system are introduced. Our results show that protocol adaptation, query dispatching, query criteria translation, and query results integration are the four main challenges in building a catalogue federation. A mediator-wrapper based approach can be adopted to build a federation service. The OpenGIS Catalogue Service specification can be used to define the internal communication protocols between the federation service and the affiliated catalogue services, and between the federation service and its clients.

                Many different types of geological hazards have seriously hindered sustainable development of society and its economy. It is critical to pay greater attention to effective geological hazard investigations, monitoring, early warning, mitigation, and prevention through advanced technologies of the Internet, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Global Positioning System (GPS), and Remote Sensing (RS). In this paper, an information system to monitor geological hazards is designed and implemented on the basis of a WEBGIS platform and a large volume of multi-source remotely sensed data; its network structure and architecture are designed and presented. Detail is provided on the key technologies and function modules. Then, a concrete system implementation is introduced using a typical instance, namely, the geological hazard monitoring of the Three Gorges Reservoir Engineering Areas, followed by conclusions and directions for future work. The focus of our work is its provision of a highly efficient means of real-time geological hazard body monitoring. In addition, information WEB publishing, geological hazard assessment and decision-making for a geological department are also important targets.
