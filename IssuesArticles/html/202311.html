                The incessant rise of artificial surfaces has increased the temperatures of cities, distressing urban health and sustainability. Fast-growing tropical cities particularly call for an understanding of this phenomenon, known as the urban heat island (UHI). The present study was conducted to detect UHI dynamics over the National Capital Region of India. Stretching over more than 32 000 km2, this region consists of urban centers of varying sizes. Landsat thermal bands were processed to extract temperature patterns between 1999 and 2019. Urban climate change was prominent, as a 2349-km2expansion in UHI area was spotted. Urban clusters of different sizes were demarcated by applying the k-nearest neighbor algorithm on the normalized difference building index maps. This empirical analysis helped to form a logarithmic relation between city size and UHI intensity. Observed results set a framework to assess the thermal environment of numerous urban centers from any tropical country. UHI intensity values for various city sizes were computed, as they were crucial to decide the outdoor comfort zones based on the base temperature conditions of other cities. Further, the critical zones in each urban cluster were identified using the vegetation index, and scopes of landscaping were suggested based on the observed building morphologies of different local climate zones.

                Rapid detection of solid waste with remote sensing images is of great significance for environmental protection. In recent years, deep learning-based object detection methods have been widely studied. In contrast to regular objects such as airplanes or buildings, solid wastes commonly h ave arbitrary shapes with difficult‐to‐distinguish boundaries. In this study, a solid waste detection network with a weighted deformable convolution and a global context block based on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) model was proposed. The designed feature extraction structure can help to enhance the boundary and shape features of solid waste. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified on the well-known DetectIon in Optical Remote sensing images data set and further on a solid waste data set, which was collected by the authors manually. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other traditional object detection methods and a maximum improvement of 5.27% was obtained compared to the FPN method.

                Forest fire detection using machine vision has recently emerged as a hot research topic. However, the complexity of background information in smoke images often results in deep learning models losing crucial details while capturing smoke image features. To address this, we present a detection algorithm called Multichannel Smoke YOLOv5s (MCSYOLOv5s). This algorithm comprises a smoke flame detection module, multichannel YOLOv5s (MC‐YOLOv5s), and a smoke cloud classification module, Smoke Classification Network (SCN). MC‐YOLOv5s uses a generative confrontation structure to design a dual‐channel feature extraction network and adopts a new feature cross-fusion mechanism to enhance the smoke feature extraction ability of classic YOLOv5s. The SCN module combines Weather Research and Forecasting numerical forecast results to classify smoke and clouds to reduce false positives caused by clouds. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed forest fire monitoring method, MCS‐YOLOv5s, achieves higher detection accuracy of 95.17%, surpassing all comparative algorithms. Moreover, it effectively reduces false alarms caused by clouds.

                Correspondence selection is an indispensable process in point cloud registration. The success of point cloud registration largely depends on a good correspondence selection method. For this purpose, a novel correspondence selection method is proposed in this paper. First, two geometric constraints, one of which is proposed in this paper, are used to compute the compatibility score between two correspondences. Then, the feature vectors of the correspondences are constructed according to the compatibility scores between the correspondence and others. A support vector machine classifier is trained to classify the correct and incorrect correspondences by using the feature vectors. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can choose the right correspondences well and get high precision and F-score performance. Also, our method has the best robustness to noise, pointdensity variation, and partial overlap compared to the other methods.

                Self-calibration method for the stereo vision system of the Chang’E-5 probe is proposed. The footprints left by the robot arm after touching the ground are regarded as the lunar control points. A stereo constraint is proposed, and a combined adjustment model is established. The accuracy of the proposed method is verified by Earth-based and lunar experiments. In the Earth-based experiment, the proposed method obtained a 3.18 mm average positioning error in 50 sets of tests, the average residual error of nine footprints was 0.45 pixels, and the unit weight mean square error of Moncam B was 0.181 pixels. In the lunar experiment, the proposed method obtained a 3.22 mm average positioning error in 50 sets of tests, and the unit weight mean-square error of Moncam B was 0.172 pixels. The experimental results show that the proposed method provides high accuracy and stability.
