                To address the high-cost problem of the current three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction for urban buildings, a new technical framework is proposed to generate3Dbuilding facade information using crowd-sourced photos and two-dimensional (2D) building vector data in this paper. The crowd-sourced photos mainly consisted of Tencent street view images and other-source photos, which were collected from three platforms, including search engines, social media, and mobile phones. The photos were selected and grouped first, and then a structure from motion algorithm was used for3Dreconstruction. Finally, the reconstructed point clouds were registered with 2D building vector data. The test implementation was conducted in the Jianye District of Nanjing, China, and the generated point clouds showed a good fit with the true values. The proposed3Dreconstruction method represents a multi-sourced data integration process. The advantage of the proposed approach lies in the open source and low-cost data used in this study.

                Cuprite, Nevada, is a location well known for numerous studies of its hydrothermal mineralogy. This region has been used to validate geological interpretations of airborne hyperspectral imagery (AVIRIS HSI ), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER ) imagery, and most recently eight-band WorldView-3 shortwave infrared (SWIR ) imagery. WorldView-3 is a high-spatial-resolution commercial multispectral satellite sensor with eight visible-to-near-infrared (VNIR ) bands (0.42–1.04 μm) and eight SWIR bands (1.2–2.33 μm). We have applied mineral mapping techniques to all 16 bands to perform a geological analysis of the Cuprite, Nevada, location. Ground truth for the training and validation was derived from AVIRIS hyperspectral data and United States Geological Survey mineral spectral data for this location. We present the results of a supervised mineral-mapping classification applying a random-forest classifier. Our results show that with good ground truth, WorldView-3 SWIR + VNIR imagery produces an accurate geological assessment.

                Blockchain is an emerging technology whose extraordinary advantages make it popular. Blockchain applications are not limited to cryptocurrencies; it can be used in many areas, including smart ownership. Blockchain-based land registry systems have great potential thanks to their advantages of high-level security and no intermediary transactions. Although the requirements of land registry systems vary by country, common to all of them are the eye-catching advantages and conveniences that a blockchain-based system brings. We examined the process used in Turkey, which consists of eight steps, identified the participants of the system, and generated a blockchain-based land registry system for Turkey. This article explains that proposed blockchain-based land registry system, configured for the local requirements of Turkey.
