                Regulatory agencies have identified unregulated stockpiles of waste tires as a threat to human health and environmental safety. Waste tires are complex spectrally-variable targets, mixing geographically and spectrally with other land covers like water and shadow. Additionally, few training sets are available. We describe a methodology combining visual analysis and the use of a univariate decision tree to locate waste tire piles in 8,498 sq km of QuickBird imagery along the United States-Mexico border. A total of 89 sites were identified as possible waste tire disposal sites and targeted for field inspection. Excluding two sites previously known to the analyst and eleven sites that were inaccessible to the inspectors, 66 of target sites (87 percent) were correctly identified by this methodology as containing tires. Three sites were determined to be false positives (4 percent errors of commission) through ground verification, but errors of omission were not able to be determined in this study.

                Urban tree canopy cover is often mapped by classifying high-resolution multispectral imagery. However, it can be difficult to differentiate low-lying vegetation from tree cover using optical data alone. Combining a lidar-derived Normalized Digital Surface Model (NDSM) improves classification accuracy, but the optical imagery is often imperfectly aligned with the NDSM. Aerial imagery is normally orthorectified using the ground elevation. However, tall objects in the orthorectified imagery still suffer from relief displacement. This can cause classification errors when lidar and the aerial imagery are combined.This study presents an approach for urban tree cover mapping composed of two parts: a method for correcting the relief displacement of trees in previously orthorectified aerial imagery, and an object-based classification method which combines relief-corrected multispectral aerial imagery with a lidar-derived NDSM. Using these methods, the tree cover was mapped for a 1,600 ha region of London, Ontario, Canada with improved positional and classification accuracy.

                This study presents a comparative analysis of several algorithms for the estimation of cyanobacterial pigments chlorophyll a (CHL) and phycocyanin (PC) from hyperspectral reflectance, while also providing a consistent basis for determining the best performing models in predicting both CHL and PC concentrations. Simple band ratio algorithms, band tuning methods, semi-empirical algorithms, and the modified Gaussian model (MGM) parameters were used to estimate CHL and PC from multiple source spectral datasets of two eutrophic central Indiana reservoirs: Eagle Creek and Morse. The spectral datasets were collected over a three-year period (2005 to 2007) using two field-based (ASD Field-Spec; Ocean Optics USB4000) spectroradiometers Spectral parameters used in these mapping algorithms were examined for their correlation to the CHL and PC concentrations. The results demonstrate for estimating CHL, simple and modified band ratios performed well; for PC estimation, the highest performing models include the algorithms using MGM strength and band tuning methodology.

            Estimating Urban Leaf Area Index (LAI) of Individual Trees with Hyperspectral Data

                This study estimated leaf area index (LAI) of individual urban trees as a function of spectral features derived from airborne hyperspectral data. Candidate features included spectral indexes, principal components, and calibrated reflectance values. Hyperspectral images were acquired over Provo, Utah area, and LAI of 204 deciduous trees was measured in the field. These tree canopies were identified on the images, and spectral features were extracted using both whole canopy and mean-lit spectra techniques. Multiple regression and artificial neural networks were used to model leaf area and determine which spectral features were most strongly related to it. Results established that simple hyperspectral vegetation indexes explained more variation in urban tree LAI than either principal component scores or simple band reflectance values. The neural network model trained with a subset of those indexes explained more variation in LAI (R2= 64.8 percent) than any of the multiple regression models tested.

                Bundle adjustment is a well known and reliable method used in photogrammetry for image network orientation which requires relatively accurate initial approximations of image orientations and point coordinates. The initialization problem has proved difficult and a variety of initialization techniques have been proposed. We present a new method that takes advantage of the scaled orthographic projection to compute direct linear solutions that approximate the image network geometry. The algorithm includes two relative orientation methods adapted from previous work, and incorporates a recently developed orthographic bundle adjustment method. Following initial network orientation, image coordinates are corrected for perspective to obtain an intermediate solution which is converted into perspective projection parameters and a final bundle adjustment is performed. The method has been tested using several image sets and has proven to be effective at various fields of view, with a variety of imaging network geometries, and with different object point geometries.

                Close-range photogrammetry has been used to control the construction of a jig used in the assembly of a new generation solar concentrator and the validation of the final, mirrored surface. The concentrator is a concave paraboloid dish with an area of a 489 m2. The typical photogrammetric relative precision realized was 1:175,000, corresponding to an accuracy of better than 1 mm at the jig reference points. The validation of the mirrored surface achieved a relative precision of 1:300,000. Photogrammetry was also used to characterize the dish mirror panels. The rear surface of the panels was mapped, as it made possible a denser target array and quicker image capture than if the reflective surface was used. The targets were produced with a digital projector, and the typical measurement precision attained was 1:150,000. This paper describes the equipment and techniques required to provide the required accuracy and precision for the jig and panel surfaces.
