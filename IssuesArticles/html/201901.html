                Streets are essential entities of urban terrain and their automatic extraction from airborne sensor data is cumbersome because of a complex interplay of geometric, topological, and semantic aspects. Given a binary image representing the road class, centerlines of road segments are extracted by means of skeletonization. The focus of this paper lies in a well-reasoned representation of these segments by means of geometric primitives, such as straight line segments as well as circle and ellipse arcs. Thereby, we aim at a fusion of raw segments to longer chains which better match to the intuitive perception of what a street is. We propose a two-step approach for simultaneous chain-forming and generalization. First, we obtain an over-segmentation of the raw polylines. Then, a model selection approach is applied to decide whether two neighboring segments should be fused to a new geometric entity. For this purpose, we propose an iterative greedy optimization procedure in order to find a strong minimum of a cost function based on a Bayesian information criterion. Starting at the given initial raw segments, we thus can obtain a set of chains describing long alleys and important roundabouts. Within the procedure, topological attributes, such as junctions and neighborhood structures, are consistently updated, in a way that for the greedy optimization procedure, accuracy, model complexity, and topology are considered simultaneously. The results on two challenging datasets indicate the benefits of the proposed procedure and provide ideas for future work.

                Commercial aerial laser scanning is generally delivered with point-by-point metadata for object identification, but current vendor-generated classification approaches (which rely exclusively on that data) generate high misclassification rates in urban areas. To overcome this problem and provide a fully scalable solution that harnesses distributed computing capabilities, this paper introduces a novel system, employing a MapReduce framework and existing GIS-based data, to provide more detailed and accurate classification. The approach goes beyond traditional gross-level classification (roads, buildings, trees, noise) by enriching the point cloud metadata with detailed semantic information about the object type. The approach was evaluated using two datasets of differing point density, separated by eight years for the same study area in Dublin, Ireland. As evaluated against manually classified data, classification quality ranged from 76% to 91% depending upon category and only 8% remained unclassified, as opposed to the commercial vendor's classification quality which ranged from 43% to 78% with 82% left unclassified.

                Soil moisture is an important state variable of the land surface ecosystem. In this paper, the water cloud model (WCM) and advanced integral equation model (AIEM) are coupled to retrieve soil moisture using time series Sentinel-1A data and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), are cross-combined to initialize the calibrated model. The calibration results show the following: (1) Vegetation parameters have a great influence on model calibration; and (2) The combination of (NDVI,LAI) is recommended to calibrate the coupled model, theRMSE, R2is 0.739 dB, and 0.716 for the observed and estimated backscattering coefficients. The soil moisture inversion results show that: (1) the accuracy of model calibration and soil moisture inversion are inconsistent; and (2) The normalized vegetation parameters, such asNDVI,EVIandFPAR, are suitable forWCMto describe vegetation characteristics, andNDVIis the optimum. When V2 is theNDVI, the average bias, MAE,RMSE, ubRMSEand R2are –0.007 m3/m3, 0.074 m3/m3, 0.087 m³/m³, 0.087 m3/m3and 0.750, respectively.

            Individual Tree Detection and Crown Delineation with 3D Information from Multi-view Satellite Images

                Individual tree detection and crown delineation (ITDD) are critical in forest inventory management and remote sensing based forest surveys are largely carried out through satellite images. However, most of these surveys only use 2D spectral information which normally has not enough clues forITDD. To fully explore the satellite images, we propose aITDDmethod using the orthophoto and digital surface model (DSM) derived from the multi-view satellite data. Our algorithm utilizes the top-hat morphological operation to efficiently extract the local maxima fromDSMas treetops, and then feed them to a modified superpixel segmentation that combines both 2D and 3D information for tree crown delineation. In subsequent steps, our method incorporates the biological characteristics of the crowns through plant allometric equation to falsify potential outliers. Experiments against manually marked tree plots on three representative regions have demonstrated promising results – the best overall detection accuracy can be 89%.

            The Potential of Multispectral Vegetation Indices Feature Space for Quantitatively Estimating the Photosynthetic, Non-Photosynthetic Vegetation and Bare Soil Fractions in Northern China

                Non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) is widely distributed in the arid and semi-arid area, especially in the sandy areas. The hyperspectral-based cellulose absorption index (CAI) is an accepted method for estimating the cover fractions ofNPV. However, the spaceborne hyperspectral data currently available to us are very limited. In this study, we tried to identify one or more combinations based on the multispectral vegetation indices feature space model to quantitatively estimate thePV,NPVand bare soil fractions of the Otindag Sandy Land in northern China. Three frequently-used green vegetation indices,NDVI,EVIandOSAVI, and nine multispectral-based indices sensitive toNPVwere used to examine the spatial patterns based on the field measured endmember spectra and non-growing and growing season Landsat-8OLIimage reflectance spectra. The capabilities of these different combinations were tested in this study area using mosaicked Landsat-8OLIimagery. The results show that the feature space of different combinations based on the field measured spectra and image reflectance spectra has good consistency. The separability of feature space determines the availability of this model. The normalized difference senescent vegetation index (NDSVI) and brightness index (BI) were found to have greater potential to combine with the three selected green vegetation indices for simultaneous estimation of the fractional cover of PV,NPV, and bare soil in the Otindag Sandy Land because of their clear and separable feature space. We obtained the best and medium-precision estimates forNDVI-NDSVI(fPV:RMSE=0.26; fNPV:RMSE=0.17) andOSAVI-BI(fPV:RMSE=0.27; fNPV:RMSE=0.25) for 104 field observations.
