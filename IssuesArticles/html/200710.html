                Although there have been several studies on the spectral characteristics related to leaf water content, it remains unclear whether the spectral property of leaves can be extended to the canopy-level. In this study, we attempt to compare the spectral characteristics of forest vegetation in moderate drought condition observed by laboratory measurement and satellite hyperspectral image data. Spectral reflectance data were measured from detached pine needles and oak leaves in the laboratory with a spectroradiometer. Canopy reflectance spectra of the same species were collected from temperate forest stands with dense canopy conditions using EO-1 Hyperion imaging spectrometer data obtained during the moderate drought season in 2001, and then compared with those obtained in the normal precipitation season of 2002. The relationship between leaf-level spectral reflectance and leaf water content was the clearest at the shortwave infrared (SWIR) regions. However, the canopy-level spectral characteristics of forest stands did not quite correspond with the leaf-level reflectance spectra. Further, four water-related spectral indices (WI, NDWI, MSI, and NDII) developed mainly with leaf-level reflectance were not very effective to be used with the canopy-level reflectance in dense forest condition. Forest canopy spectra under moderate drought status may be more influenced by canopy foliage mass, rather than by canopy moisture level.

                Time-series terrestrial parameters derived from NOAA/AVHRR, SPOT/VEGETATION, TERRA, or AQUA/MODIS data, such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Leaf Index Area (LAI), and Albedo, have been extensively applied to global climate change. However, the noise impedes these data from being further analyzed and used. In this paper, a wavelet-based method is used to remove the contaminated data from time-series observations, which can effectively maintain the temporal pattern and approximate the “true” signals. The method is composed of two steps: (a), time-series values are linearly interpolated with the help of quality flags and the blue band, and (b), time series are decomposed into different scales and the highest correlation among several adjacent scales is used, which is more robust and objective than the threshold-based method. Our objective was to reduce noise in MODIS NDVI, LAI, and Albedo time-series data and to compare this technique with the BISE algorithm, Fourier-based fitting method, and the Savitzky-Golay filter method. The results indicate that our newly developed method enhances the ability to remove noise in all three time-series data products.

                In this paper, the potential of a band shaving algorithm based on support vector machines (SVM) applied to hyper-spectral data for estimating biomass within grasslands is studied. Field spectrometer data and biomass measurements were collected from a homogeneously managed grassland field. TheSVMband shaving technique was compared with a partial least squares (PLS) and a stepwise forward selection analysis. Using their results, a range of vegetation indices was used as predictors for grassland biomass. Results from the band shaving showed that one band in the near-infrared region from 859 to 1,006 nm and one in the red-edge region from 668 to 776 nm used in the weighted difference vegetation index (WDVI) had the best predictive power, explaining 61 percent of grassland biomass variation. Indices based on short-wave infrared bands performed worse. Results could subsequently be applied to larger spatial extents using a high-resolution airborne digital camera (for example, Vexcel’s UltraCam™).

                Accurate, objective, reliable, and timely predictions of crop yield over large areas are critical to helping ensure the adequacy of a nation’s food supply and aiding policy makers on import/export plans and prices. Development of objective mathematical models of crop yield prediction using remote sensing is highly desirable. In this study, we develop a new methodology using an artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate and predict corn and soybean yields on a county-by-county basis, in the “corn belt” area in the Midwestern and Great Plains regions of the United States. The historical yield data and long time-series NDVI derived from AVHRR and MODIS are used to develop the models. A new procedure is developed to train the ANN model using the SCE-UA optimization algorithm. The performance of ANN models is compared with multivariate linear regression (MLR) models and validation is made on the model’s stability and forecasting ability. The new algorithms can effectively train ANN models, and the prediction accuracy can be as high as 85 percent.

            Increasing Gross Primary Production (GPP) in the Urbanizing Landscapes of Southeastern Michigan

                In order to understand the impact of urbanizing landscapes on regional gross primary production (GPP), we analyzed changes in land-cover and annual GPP over an urban-rural gradient in ten Southeastern Michigan counties between 1991 and 1999. Landsat and AVHRR remote sensing data and biophysical parameters corresponding to three major land-cover types (i.e., built-up, tree, and crop/grass) were used to estimate the annual GPP synthesized during the growing season of 1991 and 1999. According to the numbers of households reported by the U.S. Census in 1990 and 2000, the area settled at urban (>1 housing unit acre–1), suburban (0.1 to 1 housing units acre–1), and exurban (0.025 to 0.1 housing units acre–1) densities expanded, while the area settled at rural (<0.025 housing units acre–1) densities reduced. GPP in this urbanizing area, however, was found to increase from 1991 to 1999. Increasing annual GPP was attributed mainly to a region-wide increase in tree cover in 1999. In addition, the estimated annual GPP and its changes between 1991 and 1999 were found to be spatially heterogeneous. The exurban category (including constantly exurban and exurban converted from rural) was associated with the highest annual GPP as well as an intensified increase in GPP. Our study indicates that low-density exurban development, characterized by large proportions of vegetation, can be more productive in the form of GPP than the agricultural land it replaces. Therefore, low-density development of agricultural areas in U.S. Midwest, comprising significant fractions of highly productive tree and grass species, may not degrade, but enhance, the regional CO2uptake from the atmosphere.

                Evapotranspiration is an important part in surface energy balance and water balance. Compared with other methods (micrometeorological, climatological, or hydrological method), the remote sensing model has obvious superiority to estimate regional evapotranspiration over heterogeneous surfaces. In this study, based on Landsat TM/ETM+ data and meteorological data, evapotranspiration in Beijing area on 17 April 2001, 12 April 2002, 06 July 2004, 06 May 2005, and 22 May 2005 were calculated by an estimation model of regional evapotranspiration. Comparisons of energy balance components (net radiation, soil heat flux, sensible and latent heat flux) with measured fluxes were made integrating the remotely sensed fluxes by the footprint model. Results show that latent heat flux estimates (adjusted for closure) with errors (MBE±RMSE) 26.47±42.54 Wm−2, sensible heat flux error of −8.56±23.79 Wm−2, net radiation error of 25.16±50.87 Wm−2and soil heat flux error of 10.68±22.81 Wm−2. The better agreement between the estimates and the measurements indicates that the remote sensing model is appropriate for estimating regional evapotranspiration over heterogeneous surfaces. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of evapotranspiration in Beijing area was analyzed.

                River floodplains are becoming increasingly subject to multifunctional land-use. In this contribution, we are linking imaging spectrometer derived products with a dynamic vegetation model to improve the simulation and evaluation of scenarios for a river floodplain in the Netherlands. In particular, we are using airborne HyMap imaging spectrometer data to derive Leaf Area Index (LAI), spatial distribution of Plant Functional Types (PFT), and model dominant species abundances as input for the ecological model. We use the dynamic vegetation model (DVM) SMART2-SUMO to simulate vegetation succession under scenarios of changing abiotic conditions and management regimes. SMART2 is a soil chemical model whereas SUMO describes plant competition and resulting vegetation succession. We validate all remote sensing derived products and the DVM calibration independently using extensive field sampling. We conclude that the dynamic vegetation models can be successfully initialized using imaging spectrometer data at currently unprecedented accuracy. However, all efforts undertaken for validation in this contribution may significantly exceed capacities for national or continental scale application of the proposed method.
