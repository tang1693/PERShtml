                Orthophoto production aims at the elimination of sensor tilt and terrain relief effects from captured perspective imagery. Uniform scale and the absence of relief displacement in orthophotos make them an important component of GIS databases, where the user can directly determine geographic locations, measure distances, compute areas, and derive other useful information about the area in question. Differential rectification has been traditionally used for orthophoto generation. For large scale imagery over urban areas, differential rectification produces serious artifacts in the form of double mapped areas at object space locations with sudden relief variations, e.g., in the vicinity of buildings. Such artifacts are removed through true orthophoto generation methodologies which are based on the identification of occluded portions of the object space in the involved imagery. Existing methodologies suffer from several problems such as their sensitivity to the sampling interval of the digital surface model (DSM) as it relates to the ground sampling distance (GSD) of the imaging sensor. Moreover, current methodologies rely on the availability of a digital building model (DBM), which requires an additional and expensive pre-processing. This paper presents new methodologies for true orthophoto generation while circumventing the problems associated with existing techniques. The feasibility and performance of the suggested techniques are verified through experimental results with simulated and real data.

                This paper presents the potential of integrating radar data features with optical data to improve automatic land-cover mapping. For our study area of St. Louis, Missouri, Landsat ETM+and Radarsat images are orthorectified and co-registered to each other. A maximum likelihood classifier is utilized to determine different land-cover categories. Ground reference data from sites throughout the study area are collected for training and validation. The variations in classification accuracy due to a number of radar imaging processing techniques are studied. The relationship between the processing window and the land classification is also investigated. In addition, the Landsat images are fused with several combinations of processed radar features. The classification accuracies from the Landsat and radar feature combinations are studied. Our research finds that fusion of multi-sensor data improves the classification accuracy over a single Landsat sensor, although different processing techniques on radar images are required to obtain the best results. In our study, fusion of Landsat images and Radarsat feature combinations from a 13×13 entropy window, 9×9 data range widow, and 19×19 mean filter window achieves the highest overall accuracy improvement (10 percent) over the Landsat images alone.

                Photosynthetic efficiency of higher plants dynamically adapts to changing light intensity and is greatly influenced by stress, such as water stress. We tested a new portable hyperspectral imaging system, the SOC-700, manufactured by Surface Optics, which produces 12-bit reflectance images between 440 nm and 880 nm with a 4 nm spectral resolution. We quantified the reflectance properties and photochemical reflectance index (PRI) during light adaptation of genetically modifiedArabidopsis thaliana(L.) Heynh. plants lacking or over-expressing the PsbS protein, an essential component of the mechanism of non-photochemical dissipation. In a second experiment, PRI images of gradually water stressed leaves were compared to leaf-level measurements of reflectance using a second commercially available spectrometer, and chlorophyll fluorescence to detect dynamic, photosynthesis correlated changes in reflectance and PRI.In both experiments PRI measured with the SOC-700 changed, reflecting the biochemical adaptation of the photosynthetic apparatus to high light intensity (dynamic changes within minutes) and the gradual deactivation of photosynthesis during drying (changes within hours). The quantum efficiency of photosystem II(ΔF/Fm′)and non-photochemical energy dissipation (NPQ) measured from chlorophyll fluorescence, were strongly correlated with PRI. Leaf area PRI values estimated from individual pixel spectra of the SOC-700 quantified photosynthetic efficiency more thoroughly than PRI values calculated from point measurements using the hand-held GER-1500. The applications, limitations, and potential of the SOC-700 for plant eco-physiology and remote sensing are also discussed.

                This research presents an integration of remote sensing and GIS for determining the runoff coefficient (C) recommended by the American Society of Civil Engineers and the Water Pollution Control Federation in 1969. The C is a runoff index used as an input parameter in the most commonly used procedure: the rational method for storm-water runoff calculation in small urban watersheds for storm drainage design and analysis. The objective of this study was to evaluate 8-bit and 16-bit Quick-Bird (QB) NDVI satellite imagery using an unsupervised classification and the ISODATA algorithm to map impervious area and open space used for the determination of C in GIS spatial modeling. The research hypothesis was that mapping impervious area and open space using high spatial resolution NDVI satellite imagery, generated using the ISODATA algorithm, was an efficient and effective information extraction approach for accurately estimating spatial representative C values. The overall classification accuracies of the six QB NDVI thematic maps produced were similar, about 92 percent. In order to assess the utility of high spatial resolution satellite imagery and to validate the composite runoff index geographic model developed by Thanapura in 2005 and 2006, the C values were calculated in GIS spatial modeling and compared to the industry standard C. Finally, the hypothesis was accepted that the finer resolution image and mapping approach used in this study allowed for better discrimination of land-cover and thus a more accurate representative C estimation.

                Digital elevation models (DEMs) are prone to error that, as they can never be entirely eliminated, must be managed effectively. Thus, it is important to understand the nature of error and their sources, especially in the context of the intended use of a DEM. This paper investigates the effects that can be expected when common DEM errors propagate through a scaling analysis. The errors investigated include those associated with perturbation of camera exterior orientation parameters, focal length, and DEM image coordinates, which were simulated numerically. The role of detrending was also investigated. Scaling analysis, by way of the fractal dimension, using a new two-dimensional approach was carried out on a variety of surfaces before and after the introduction of error and the application of detrending. The results reveal some serious procedural implications on scaling analysis and cast doubt on the authenticity of some scaling analysis results in the absence of robust quality assessment and of independent supporting evidence.

                This paper investigates the performance of a spatio-spectral template on Ikonos imagery to automatically detect small recreational boats. The spatio-spectral template is employed which is then enhanced through use of a weighted Euclidean distance metric adapted from the Mahalanobis distance metric. The purpose is to assist the Canadian Coast Guard in gathering data on recreational boating for the modeling of search and rescue incidence risk.To test the detection accuracy of the enhanced spatio-spectral template, a dataset was created by gathering position and attribute data for 53 recreation vessel targets purposely moored for this research within Cadboro Bay, British Columbia, Canada. The Cadboro Bay study site containing the targets was imaged using Ikonos.The overall detection accuracy was 77 percent. The targets were broken down into two categories: Category A-less than 6 m in length, and Category B-greater than 6 m long. The detection rate for the Category B targets was 100 percent, while the detection rate for the Category A targets was 61 percent. It is important to note that some Category A targets were purposely selected for their small size to specifically test the detection limits of the enhanced spatio-spectral template. The smallest target detected was 2.2 meters long and 1.1 meters wide. The analysis also revealed that the ability to detect targets between 2.2 meters and 6 meters long was diminished if the target was a dark color.

            Performance Analysis of Integrated Sensor Orientation

                Integrated multi-sensor systems, with their major progress in terms of sensor resolution, data rate and operational flexibility, have become a very attractive mapping tool over the last decade. In aerial mapping application, for example, Exterior Orientation (EO) parameters for the imaging sensors are required. Using the integrated Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) with Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), direct determination of the EO parameters can be obtained from the integrated system navigation solution. This process is referred to as Direct Georeferening (DG). DG provides substantial benefits over the indirect determination method of estimating the EO parameters from conventional Aerial Triangulation (AT) techniques using a block of images with a sufficient number of known control points. These benefits include the ability to map remote and inaccessible regions, and by replacing tie point measurements/matching and AT, significant cost-savings can be obtained for projects that do not require stereo models (such as projects with existing DEM or single image). The accuracy of DG, however, is limited by the accuracy attainable by the DGPS and any residual datum calibration errors. These can typically be as large as 10 cm RMSE, which is not sufficient for some large scale mapping applications. However, by combining the direct EO data a traditional block adjustment, AT techniques can be used to remove the residual errors in the solution. This technique is known as Integrated Sensor Orientation (ISO). It has several advantages over traditional AT, primarily because the stable geometry provided by direct EO can reduce the number of required GCP and tie-point to a minimum. At the same time, ISO provides an excellent tool for Quality Control/Quality Assurance (QC/QA) of the EO derived from a DG system. This paper examines the factors that determine the system performance for ISO. In addition, examples are given to illustrate the expected accuracy of an aerial mapping project using ISO under different qualities of DGPS/IMU data.
