                This study investigated the demand of data for better high resolution two-dimensional (2D) hydraulic modeling and proposes a data set named "Hydrological Topography Data Set" (HTD for short) for this purpose. Derived from airborne lidar point cloud, the HTD comprises three parts: (1) High Resolution Hydraulic Three-Dimensional Features: high resolution three-dimensional vector data that preserves the locations and elevations of topography breaklines, (2) Hydraulic Digital Elevation Model: high resolution (1 × 1 m) DEM enhanced by the terrain breaklines to preserve the landscape characteristics, and (3) Hydraulic Digital Surface Model: high resolution (1 × 1 m) DSM conditioned by removing the height of vegetation and temporary objects. With HTD, hydraulic features such as drainages with 10 m of width can be identified and properly set up in numerical models, thus can help simulating and access- ing the flood in urban area more in detail. Through case studies we demonstrate how HTD can affect the results of hydraulic modeling. The results show that HTD can help modelers to construct proper mesh (or computational grids) for 2D hydraulic modeling, and pre- serve topography characteristics (i. e., shape and elevation), which improves the modeling results in terms of spatial resolution and physical rationality, while still keeping the computation efficient.

                To improve remote sensing-based land cover mapping over heterogenous landscapes, we developed an ensemble classifier based on stacked generalization with a new training sample refinement technique for the combiner. Specifically, a group of individual classifiers were identified and trained to derive land cover information from a satellite image covering a large complex coastal city. The mapping accuracy was quantitatively assessed with an independent reference data set, and several class probability measures were derived for each classifier. Meanwhile, various subsets were derived from the original training data set using the times of being correctly labeled by the individual classifiers as the thresholds, which were further used to train a random forest model as the combiner in generating the final class predictions. While outperforming each individual classifier, the combiner performed better when using the class probabilities rather than the class predictions as the meta-feature layers and performed significantly better when trained with a carefully selected subset rather than with the entire sample set. The novelties of this work are with the insight into the impact of different training sample subsets on the performance of stacked generalization and the filtering technique developed to prepare training samples for the combiner leading to a large accuracy improvement.

                The dynamics of urban vegetation phenology play an important role in influencing human activities. Previous studies have shown high-resolution remote sensing as a tool for urban vegetation mapping, but the low temporal resolution of these data limits their use for phenological modeling. Therefore, it is of great significance to evaluate Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery for urban vegetation phenology monitoring. Here, we extracted the start and end of growing season (SOS and EOS) in urban ecosystems based on both the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from the 250 m MODIS vegetarion indices product (MOD13Q1). Then the accuracies of the satellite-derived SOS and EOS were evaluated through comparing phenological observations at 18 ground sites. Results showed that SOS was most consistent with the prime of leaf unfolding date and EOS was most consistent with the beginning of leaf coloring date. Overall, EVI was found to have stronger predictive strength than NDVI in detecting urban vegetation phenology in terms of both higher correlation coef- ficients and lower root-mean-square errors. In addition, the dynamic threshold method was more accurate in deriving SOS, while the double logistic method had relatively higher accuracy in deriving EOS .

                Structure-from-motion (SfM) techniques have been widely used for three-dimensional (3D) scene reconstruction from sequential video frames. However, for reconstructing narrow and confined spaces such as the interior of drainage pipes, selecting geometrically optimal frames is a major challenge, not only to reduce the number of needed frames but also to yield better geometry. This paper introduces a coarse-to-fine method to optimize the selection of monocular video frames based on a geometric criterion called feature-based parallax analysis for 3D pipe reconstruction. The proposed method was applied in two experiments with a monocular camera fixed on a customized robot. Experimental results show that our approach only requires respectively 9.66% and 3.15% of the number of frames. The spatial distribution of the retrieved frames was uniform and reasonable, enabling the successful SfM process to achieve a complete reconstruction of the pipe geometry.

                The primary prerequisite for sustainable urban development is to accurately grasp the development of the city. The dynamic changes in the urban area can reflect the urban expansion process and spatial development model. Carrying out urban expansion monitoring and extracting urban areas is of great importance for grasping the law of urban development and promoting the sustainable development of cities. However, the related research reveals several problems such as insufficient accuracy and low intelligence of urban boundary extraction. In response to these problems, this paper proposes a new method for urban area extraction based on the progressive learning model. By combining prior knowledge and image features, the number of training samples required for machine learning is reduced, and the problem of using high-level semantic information expression in the process of urban areas is avoided by using the classification method, and thus the accuracy of urban area extraction is improved. The method uses urban road network data to divide the city into blocks. It applies the scene classification method to extract the urban areas and uses the pyramid layer-by-layer to carry out the space constraint method to integrate the urban extraction principle into the machine learning process, which can be obtained and kept artificial under a small sample condition. Extracting the effect of the urban area is very close, greatly reducing the workload and providing a new solution for high-precision automatic extraction of urban areas. Through the analysis of urban expansion, the following results were obtained: (1) from 2000 to 2015, China's provincial capital cities maintained a high-speed growth trend with a total area increased by 90%; (2) urban expansion showed significant regional differences. The eastern expansion rate gradually slowed down, the western and northeast regions accelerated their expansion, and the central region expanded steadily; (3) 61% of the provincial capital cities expanded exponentially; (4) the development of China's provincial capital cities was highly correlated with national urban development policies and regional development strategies.
