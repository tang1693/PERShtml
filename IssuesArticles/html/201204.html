                In an attempt to show the complexity of terrestrial laser scanning of heritage sites and dispel the not infrequently found perception of a largely automated tool with close to real time processing capabilities, the individual steps of the data acquisition and processing pipeline, including registration, point cloud cleaning, surface reconstruction, hole filling, texturing and final output are discussed. Emphasized are areas in which further development and research are desirable. A brief discussion of the concepts and implementation of the African Cultural Heritage Sites and Landscapes Project, as executed by the Zamani Research Group at the University of Cape Town, is incorporated into the paper. This database integrates spatial and non-spatial data and focuses on architectural heritage sites and cultural landscapes. The spatial data comprises of 3D laser scans, GIS’s for each site and its environment, stereo images, panoramas, ground plans, elevations and sections derived from laser scan models, contextual photography and videos as well as 3D landscape models. The database is primarily designed as a resource for research and higher education. However, the spatial data acquired for the project are presently used in a number of restoration and conservation projects. An important further objective is the creation of a permanent digital record. The project, funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, is a joint initiative of the Zamani Research Group at the University of Cape Town and JStor, New York.

                This paper presents a cell-based approach for computing the deformation of a monitored object by analyzing point cloud data from terrestrial lidar. This approach can automatically generate an informative deformation description (called “deformation map”) with distinctive deformation characteristics for different partial areas. The approach consists of three major computing steps: (a) “split” - the space of the monitored object is divided into 3D uniform cells, (b) “detect” - deformation parameters for each cell (called “meta-deformation”) are estimated by comparing the point clouds in the cell sampled at Epochs I and II, and (c) “merge” - the adjacent cells with similar meta-deformation are combined together in a partial area with a consistent “sub-deformation.” The main contributions of this paper are: (a) a hybrid deformation model for incremental and comprehensive deformation representation, including meta-deformation, sub-deformation and deformation map, (b) a systematic procedure of “split-detect-merge” to automatically and gradually estimate the hybrid deformation model, and (c) a complete validation with a couple of synthetic and real datasets.

                Among implicit information of laser points, the strength of reflection of laser points is closely related to the property of road materials which helps detecting road markings. This paper presents a novel approach to automatically extracting road markings from mobile lidar point clouds. An interpolation method is first used to generate a georeferenced feature image of the point cloud, which helps to isolate the points of road surfaces. Then, an algorithm is used to separate these points within a range according to their strength of reflection. The separated points are further segmented to remove non-road points based on height threshold. Finally, the outlines of road markings are extracted from the segmented points using the semantic knowledge of road markings. The results demonstrated that our method was very promising for automatic extraction of road markings from lidar point clouds collected by a land-based mobile lidar system, an Optech Lynx Mobile Mapper.

                A proposed methodology for the simultaneous kinematic calibration and boresight adjustment of the Velodyne HDL-64E S2 scanning lidar system is presented and analyzed. The mathematical model for both the measurements of the HDL-64E S2 scanner and their georeferencing by a GNSS/INS system is presented and discussed. A planar feature based least squares adjustment approach is utilized in order to derive an optimal solution for the laser’s internal calibration parameters and boresight offsets. The results of the adjustment on an actual kinematic dataset along with a detailed examination of the adjustment residuals are given. An approximately 30 percent improvement in the 3D planar misclosure residual RMSE was achieved by the proposed calibration, as compared to an estimation of the laser boresight parameters only. Results also suggest that there may still be some un-modeled distortions in the range measurements from the scanner. However, despite this, the overall precision of the adjusted laser scanner data appears to make it a viable choice for high accuracy mobile scanning applications.

                Woody plant encroachment directly threatens the grass forage production and reduces the area of cultivated lands. The rate of woody plant encroachment is increasing rapidly on rangelands of the southwestern US. However, woody plants, such as mesquite, are a possible source of bioenergy feedstock found on semi-arid lands. This study developed algorithms for determining woody plant biomass on rangelands at plot-level with a terrestrial lidar system. Two processing methods were investigated for analyzing the lidar point cloud data, namely: (a) percentile height statistics, and (b) a height bin approach. Regression models were developed for variables obtained through each processing technique and were able to explain 81 percent and 77 percent of the variance associated with the aboveground biomass using two processing methods, respectively. The results of this study revealed that terrestrial lidar can be used to accurately and efficiently estimate the aboveground biomass of woody plants in a semi-arid environment at plot level.

                Accurate stream topography measurement is important for many ecological applications such as hydraulic modeling and habitat characterization. Habitat complexity measures are often made using visual approximations or total station (TS) surveying that can be subjective and have limited spatial resolution. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) can measure topography at a high resolution and accuracy. Two methods, TS surveying and TLS, were compared for measuring complex topography in a boulder-dominated 100 m forested reach of the Staunton River in Shenandoah National Park, Virginia. The mean absolute difference between the two datasets was 0.11 m with 82.3 percent of the TS data within ±0.1 m of TLS. The TLS dataset was processed to remove vegetation and create a 2 cm digital elevation model (DEM). An algorithm was developed for delineating rocks within the stream channel from the DEM. A common ecological metric based on the structural complexity of the stream, percent in-stream rock cover, was calculated from the TLS dataset, and the results were compared to estimates from traditional methods. This application illustrates the potential of TLS to quantify habitat complexity measures in an automated, unbiased manner.

                Vehicle-borne laser-scanned point clouds have become increasingly important 3D data sources in fields such as digital city modeling and emergency response management. Aiming at reducing the technical bottlenecks of management and visualization of very large point cloud data sets, this paper proposes a new spatial organization method called 3DOR-Tree, which integrates Octree and 3D R-Tree data structures. This method utilizes Octree’s rapid convergence to generate R-Tree leaf nodes, which are inserted directly into the R-Tree, thus avoiding time-consuming point-by-point insertion operations. Furthermore, this paper extends the R-Tree structure to support LOD (level of detail) models. Based on the extended structure, a practical data management method is presented. Finally, an adaptive control method for LODS of point clouds is illustrated. Typical experimental results show that our method possesses quasi-real-time index construction speed, a good storage utilization rate, and efficient visualization performance.

                For a fundamental understanding of environmental processes and for the management of forests, information on the tree structure, preferably in 3D, is vital. Therefore, we propose a method to retrieve the spatial tree structure from 3D point clouds captured by a terrestrial laser scanner. The procedure addresses dense and noisy data sets of separate trees. Our method involves a variation of the Circular Hough Transform to determine trunk positions and a sequence of operations in voxel space. The core of the approach is the depth-first search algorithm, known from graph theory, to actually recover the tree as a graph. Furthermore, we compare results obtained from the tree graph to reference measurements of forest inventory parameters. The computation time of our method for topology representation is low and the method provides a reasonably accurate approximation of the 3D tree structure.
