                This study assesses the performance of five Machine Learning Algorithms (MLAs) in a chronically modified mixed deciduous forest in Massachusetts (USA) in terms of their ability to detect selective timber logging and to cope with deficient reference datasets. Multitemporal Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper-plus (ETM+) imagery is used to assess the performance of three Artificial Neural Networks – Multi-Layer Perceptron, ARTMAP, Self-Organizing Map, and two Classification Tree splitting algorithms: gini and entropy rules. MLA performance evaluations are based on susceptibility to reduced training set size, noise, and variations in the training set, as well as the operability/transparency of the classification process. Classification trees produced the most accurate selective logging maps (gini and entropy rule decision tree mean overall map accuracy = 94 percent and mean per-class kappa of 0.59 and 0.60, respectively). Classification trees are shown to be more robust and accurate when faced with deficient training data, regardless of splitting rule. Of the neural network algorithms, self-organizing maps were least sensitive to the introduction of noise and variations in training data. Given their robust classification capabilities and transparency of the class-selection process, classification trees are preferable algorithms for mapping selective logging and have potential in other forest monitoring applications.

                Three machine learning subpixel estimation methods (Cubist, Random Forests, and support vector regression) were applied to estimate urban cover. Urban forest canopy cover and impervious surface cover were estimated from Landsat-7 ETM+ imagery using a higher resolution cover map resampled to 30 m as training and reference data. Three different band combinations (reflectance, tasseled cap, and both reflectance and tasseled cap plus thermal) were compared for their effectiveness with each of the methods. Thirty different training site number and size combinations were also tested. Support vector regression on the tasseled cap bands was found to be the best estimator for urban forest canopy cover, while Cubist performed best using the reflectance plus tasseled cap band combination when predicting impervious surface cover. More training data partitioned in many small training sites generally produces better estimation results.

                Recent advances in kernel machines promote the novel use of Gaussian processes (GP) for Bayesian learning. Our purpose is to introduce GP models into the remote sensing community for supervised learning as exemplified in this study for classifying hyperspectral images. We first provided the mathematical formulation of GP models concerning both regression and classification; described several GP classifiers (GPCLs) and the automatic learning of kernel parameters; and then, examined the effectiveness of GPCLs compared with K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Experiment results on an Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectroradiometer image indicate that the GPCLs outperform KNN and yield classification accuracies comparable to or even better than SVMs. This study shows that GP models, though with a larger computation scaling than SVM, bring a competitive tool for remote sensing applications related to classification or possibly regression, particularly with small or moderate sizes of training datasets.

                A neuro-fuzzy system, namely Gaussian Fuzzy Learning Vector Quantization (GFLVQ), was developed based on the synergy of a neural network and a fuzzy system. GFLVQ is both a fuzzy neural network and a neural fuzzy system with supervised learning and unsupervised self-organizing capabilities. In this paper, GFLVQ was further improved to efficiently and effectively process hyperspectral data through training data informed initialization and a simplified fuzzy learning algorithm. A geovisualization tool was developed to facilitate knowledge discovery and understanding of the hyperspectral image. A case study was conducted using a Hyperion image. The results obtained from the improved neuro-fuzzy system were found to be significantly better than those from conventional statistics-based and endmember-based classifiers. The fuzzy spectral profiles produced from the geovisualization tool provided an extra insight into the neuro-fuzzy learning process, further opening up the black box of the neural network.

                Site-Specific Herbicide Management (SSHM) in Precision Agriculture (PA) requires weed detection in crop fields for directed herbicide application instead of spraying entire fields. This has significant economic and environmental advantages for improved agricultural practices that are essential given forecast increases in global population and food production needs. In this study, a new hybrid segmentation - Artificial Neural Network (HS-ANN) method was compared to standard Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) for improving crop/weed species discrimination in SSHM/PA. Very high spatial resolution (1.25 mm) ground-based hyperspectral image data were acquired over field plots of canola, pea, and wheat crops seeded with two weed species (redroot pigweed, wild oat) in southern Alberta, Canada. The very high spatial and spectral resolution image data required development of a simple yet efficient vegetation index (Modified Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index (MCARI)) threshold segmentation to separate vegetation from soil for classification. The HSANN consistently outperformed MLC in both single date and multi-temporal classifications. Higher class accuracies were obtained with multi-temporally trained ANNs (84 to 92 percent overall), with improvements up to 31 percent over MLC. With advancements in imaging technology and computer processing speed, this HS-ANN method may constitute a viable farm option for real-time detection and mapping of weed species for SSHM in agriculture.

                The effect of pruning neural network structures in remote sensing is investigated. Standard pruning methods, i.e., Optimal Brain Damage and Optimal Brain Surgeon, are compared with pruning based on a genetic algorithm. Direct coding is used to represent the links of the network for optimization with a canonical genetic algorithm using binary representation. The results show that the genetic algorithm is the only method able to discover a significantly better neural network structure. The main drawback of the genetic approach is the extensive training time required.

                This paper discusses the use of genetic algorithms to enhance the efficiency of transition rule calibration in cellular automata urban growth modeling. The cellular automata model is designed as a function of multitemporal satellite imagery and population density. Transition rules in the model identify the required neighborhood urbanization level for a test pixel to develop to urban. Calibration of the model is initially performed by exhaustive search, where the entire solution space is examined to find the best set of rule values. This method is computationally extensive and needs to consider all possible combinations for the transition rules. The rise in the number of variables will exponentially increase the time required for running and calibrating the model. This study introduces genetic algorithms as an effective solution to the calibration problem. It is shown that the genetic algorithms are able to produce modeling results close to the ones obtained from the exhaustive search in a time effective manner. Optimal rule values can be reached within the early generations of genetic algorithms. It is expected that genetic algorithms will significantly benefit urban modeling problems with larger set of input data and bigger solution spaces.
