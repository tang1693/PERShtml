                One of the most challenging problems in automated clustering of hyperspectral data is determining the number of clusters (NOC) either prior to or during the clustering. We propose a statistical method for best estimating the NOC, not only prior to but also independent of the clustering. This method uses both residual analysis (RA) and change point analysis (CPA) to select a number of candidates. Because the NOC and the data intrinsic dimension (ID) interact with one another in a predictable way, ID can provide useful inferential information about the NOC. Indeed, once the ID has been found, the NOC can be inferred on the basis of this information. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by processing several hyperspectral datasets. Furthermore, a comparison with the results of the partitional approach, using some well-known similarity measures, has demonstrated that our method is more effective in detecting the optimal NOC.

                This research provides a comprehensive accuracy assessment of five methods for classifying western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis) canopy cover from 1 m, 4-band National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery. Two object-oriented classification approaches (image segmentation and spatial wavelet analysis, (SWA)) are compared to three pixel based classification approaches (random forests, Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis (ISODATA), and maximum likelihood). Methods are applied to approximately 250 km2 in the intermountain western USA. A robust suite of statistical approaches, which offer an alternative to traditional kappa-based methods, are utilized to determine equivalence between methods and overall effectiveness. Object-oriented approaches have the highest overall accuracy among the assessed methods. Each of the methods varied considerably in cover class accuracy. SWA has the highest class accuracy when juniper canopy cover is low (0 to 40 percent cover), ISODATA performs best at moderate cover (60 to 80 percent) and maximum likelihood performs best at higher cover (60 to 100 percent cover).

                This research analyzes the sensitivity of the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) flow rate and sediment yield to DEM spatial resolution. A scaling analysis is performed using 1 to 50 m resolution lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) derived DEMs. Thomas Brook, Canada, serves as a case study watershed for a five year simulation period. Results indicated monthly water yield was insensitive to DEM resolution, unless a change in area was also present. Sediment yield from the 50 m DEM showed a 200 t reduction compared to the 1 m DEM. The 5 to 50 m DEMs also showed a reduction in channel deposition of 45 to 90 t, respectively, compared to the 1 m DEM. Results suggest parameterization using multiple resolution DEMs is desirable, one commensurate with the scale used to establish universal soil loss equations for defining hillslope scale, and high resolution for stream network and sub-basin delineation.

            Analysis of Dual-Sensor Stereo Geometry and Its Positioning Accuracy

                This research investigated the positioning accuracy and imaging geometry of dual-sensor stereo pairs in comparison with those of conventional single-sensor stereo pairs. First, we discuss the difference between single- and dual-sensor stereo geometry and suggest that bisector elevation (BIE) and asymmetry angle, in addition to convergence angle, are important considerations for interpreting dual-sensor stereo geometry. We point out that for single-sensor BIE angles and asymmetry angles are close to ideal values, and their importance has not been highlighted. We show that dual-sensor stereo may produce small BIE angles and large asymmetry angles, and such angles may lead to weak geometry and accuracy degradation of dual-sensor stereo. Second, we compare rigorous sensor models (RSMs) with rational function models (RFMs) for handling dual-sensor stereo. For stable dual-sensor stereo, both models show similar performance. However, for dual-sensor stereo with weak geometry, RSMs produce better positioning accuracies than RFMs.

                Due to the costs, sensitivity, and export policies of many governments, universities, and research institutions, particularly in developing countries, the ability to purchase, install and maintain high-accuracy inertial navigation system (INS) and global positioning system (GPS) is restricted. This paper presents a new method for SAR imaging and interferometry using parameters estimated from raw data. First, methods for determining the order of real and imaginary parts within the raw data images, and for determining chirp rate polarity are proposed. Second, a selection of parameters, including the forward effective velocities of the sensor, the near range distance, and the squint angle, are extracted using the Doppler centroid and Doppler rate. Finally, we create single look complex (SLC) images, coherence maps, digital elevation models (DEMs), and dual-pass differential unwrapped phase maps. The level of accuracy shown in this comparative study suggests that the proposed method is acceptable for creating the featured SAR products and is suitable for real world applications. This method and result is particularly relevant for systems which suffer from a lack of high-accuracy positional metadata.

                In this study, the Savitzky-Golay filter was applied to smooth observed unnatural variations in the temporal profiles of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). We computed two sets of land cover classifications based on the NDVI and EVI time series before and after applying the Savitzky-Golay filter. The resulting classification from the filtered versions of the vegetation indices showed a substantial improvement in accuracy when compared to the classifications from the unfiltered versions. The classification by the EVIsg had the highest K (0.72) for all classes compared to those of the EVI (0.67), NDVI (0.63), and NDVIsg (0.62). Therefore, we conclude that the EVIsg is best suited for land cover classification compared to the other data sets in this study.
