                In this paper, a standardized probability approach is presented to evaluate the pixel labeling confidence of each pixel and then combine the classification maps generated from different classification procedures for improving classification accuracy. This approach examines the posterior probability of the maximum-likelihood classifier or inverse-distance weight for the minimum-distance classifier for each pixel. It recommends that, for every classification, a standardized probability map should be outputted along with the classified map to show the pixel labeling confidence for all pixels. Tests based on different feature combinations and training strategies from Ikonos data show that the proposed approach was effective in improving the labeling confidence, as well as overall classification accuracy when classified maps from different classification procedures were combined. This standardized probability can be used to provide additional spatial information along with the traditional accuracy assessment.

                Due to the existence of shadows, especially in urban environments, it is difficult to extract semantic information from aerial and high-resolution satellite images. In this paper, an efficient method of correcting shadow effects using multisource data sets in aerial color images is proposed. The proposed method has three steps. First, it accurately detects the shadowed regions using the image geometry and the solar position of the image acquisition data. Then, the detected shadowed regions are segmented according to land surface type. Finally, the shadow effects of the segmented regions are corrected by directly comparing the same nonshadow features with the segmented shadows. In the application part of this paper, the proposed techniques were applied in the extraction of an asphalt road from an image.

                It is very important to acquire timely information on the spatial distribution of locust populations in order to bring a locust outbreak under control quickly. In this study, we propose a new method for estimating the Oriental migratory locust density using a Locust Density Index (LDI). This index is based on the change in vegetation before an outbreak and shortly after the outbreak, taking into account the pre-outbreak vegetation conditions as well. This method was applied to study three locust-infested sites in Huanghua City, Hebei Province in China during a 2002 outbreak. NDVI images were derived from radiometrically corrected multi-temporal Landsat TM/ETM+ data recorded during and after the outbreak. After radiometry of the post-outbreak NDVI image was standardized to that of its during-outbreak counterpart, their difference multiplied by the pre-outbreak NDVI (termed LDI) was used to map the density of locusts at five levels of no locust, low, moderate, high, and very high. Nearly 90 percent of the study sites had a low to moderate locust density. Results produced with the proposed LDI method are similar to those observed on the ground with an accuracy of 88.9 percent. This proposed LDI method is easy to implement. It allows quick and accurate mapping of locust density from satellite data.

                The extraction of a digital elevation model (DEM) from airborne lidar point clouds is an important task in the field of geoinformatics. In this paper, we describe a new automated scheme that utilizes the so-called “climbingand-sliding” method to search for ground points from lidar point clouds for DEM generation. The new method has the capability of performing a local search while preserving the merits of a global treatment. This is done by emulating the natural movements of climbing and sliding in order to search for ground points on a terrain surface model. To improve efficiency and accuracy, the scheme is implemented with a pseudo-grid data and includes a back selection step for densification. The test data include a dataset released from the ISPRS Working Group III/3 and one for a mountainous area located in southern Taiwan. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is capable at producing a high fidelity terrain model.

                Estimation of land surface temperature and emissivity has taken on a great deal of importance in recent remote sensing studies. The estimation of temperature and emissivity from thermal radiation observations is involved with an underdetermined equation set. In this study, an approach is proposed to overcome the problem based on statistical theory of observations and error propagation. First, the under-determined radiance equations have been completed using two NDVI-based equations for the mean and difference emissivities as constraint equations. The two added constraint equations provide the possibility of weighted least squares solution to estimate temperature and emissivity from the over-determined equation set simultaneously. The weights have been calculated based on the uncertainty of each of the equations. The weighting basis of the proposed approach allows statistical control on the uncertainties. The advantages of the weighted least squares solution which is contributed by this study are weighted observations used in the solution, the uncertainty considerations of the used observations, uncertainty propagation control, statistical standard deviation estimation for the unknowns, statistical quality control criteria, and the opportunity of systematic error detection. The numerical efficiency of the proposed approach is examined using a great number of simulated sample data. Then, the proposed approach is validated using the in situ measurements of land surface temperature. The validations accompanied by some statistical tests represent the acceptable performance and accuracy of the proposed approach (approximately 0.5°K for LST standard deviation and approximately 0.0075 for standard deviation of the bands 31 and 32 emissivities). In addition, the simplicity and robustness of the proposed approach may be regarded as a considerable achievement.

            Comparison of Nine Fusion Techniques for Very High Resolution Data

                The term “image fusion” covers multiple techniques used to combine the geometric detail of a high-resolution panchromatic image and the color information of a lowresolution multispectral image to produce a final image with the highest possible spatial information content while still preserving good spectral information quality.During the last twenty years, many methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multiplicative Transform, Brovey Transform, and IHS Transform have been developed producing good quality fused images. Despite the quite good visual results, many research papers have reported the limitations of the above fusion techniques. The most significant problem is color distortion. Another common problem is that the fusion quality often depends upon the operator’s fusion experience and upon the data set being fused.In this study, we compare the efficiency of nine fusion techniques and more specifically the efficiency of IHS, Modified IHS, PCA, Pansharp, Wavelet, LMM (Local Mean Matching), LMVM (Local Mean and Variance Matching), Brovey, and Multiplicative fusion techniques for the fusion of QuickBird data. The suitability of these fusion techniques for various applications depends on the spectral and spatial quality of the fused images.In order to quantitatively measure the quality of the fused images, we have made the following controls. First, we have examined the visual qualitative result. Then, we examined the correlation between the original multispectral and the fused images and all the statistical parameters of the histograms of the various frequency bands. Finally, we performed an unsupervised classification, and we compared the resulting images.All the fusion techniques improve the resolution and the visual result. The resampling method practically has no effect on the final visual result. The LMVM, the LMM, the Pansharp, and the Wavelet merging technique do not change the statistical parameters of the original images. The Modified IHS provokes minor changes to the statistical parameters than the classical IHS or than the PCA. After all the controls, the LMVM, the LMM, the Pansharp, and the Modified IHS algorithm seem to gather the more advantages in fusion panchromatic and multispectral data.

                A 20-channel, dual-frequency GPS receiver collecting pseudorange and carrier phase observations was used as a stand-alone receiver to determine positional accuracy of 19 points under conifer tree canopies. The positions were determined utilizing precise satellite orbit and clock products from the International GNSS Service. The mean positional accuracy ranged from 0.27 to 0.88 m for an observation period of 120 minutes, and 0.95 to 3.48 m for 15 minutes. For the 15 minute observation period computed positions could not be found for 8 to 44 percent of the locations. Accuracy increased with decreasing forest stand density. Stand basal area (R2 = 0.11, p < 0.001) and number of tree stems (R2 = 0.07, p < 0.001) were significantly correlated with accuracy. The probability of determining a position increased with longer observation periods and decreasing number of tree stems. For natural resource applications where the costs associated with the length of the observation period on each site in field is a critical factor, differential GPS seems to be a more robust alternative than precise point positioning with GPS.
