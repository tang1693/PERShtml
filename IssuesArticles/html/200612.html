                This paper analyzes the potential of airborne laser scanner data for measuring individual tree height growth in a boreal forest using 82 sample trees of Scots pine. Point clouds (10 points/m2, beam size 40 cm) illuminating 50 percent of the treetops were acquired in September 1998 and May 2003 with the Toposys 83 kHz lidar system. The reference height and height growth of pines were measured with a tacheometer in the field. Three different types of features were extracted from the point clouds representing each tree; they were the difference between the highest z values, the difference between the DSMs of the tree crown, and the differences between the 85th, 90thand 95thpercentiles of the canopy height histograms corresponding to the crown. The best correspondence with the field measurements was achieved with an R2value of 0.68 and a RMSE of 43 cm. The results indicate that it is possible to measure the growth of an individual tree with multi-temporal laser surveys. We also demonstrated a new algorithm for tree-to-tree matching. It is needed in operational growth estimation based on individual trees, especially in dense spruce forests. The method is based on minimizing the distances between treetops in the N-dimensional data space. The experiments showed that the use of the location (derived from laser data) and height of the trees were together adequate to provide reliable tree-to-tree matching. In the future, a fourth dimension (the crown area) should also be included in the matching.

                Improved understanding of the role of forests in carbon, nutrient, and water cycling can be facilitated with improved assessments of canopy structure, better linking leaf-level processes to canopy structure and forest growth. We examined the use of high-resolution, ground-based laser imaging for the spatially explicit assessment of forest canopies. Multiple range images were obtained and aligned during both leaf-off and leaf-on conditions on a 20 m × 40 m plot. The plot location was within a mixed species broadleaved deciduous forest in western North Carolina. Digital terrain and canopy height models were created for a 0.25 m square grid. Horizontal, vertical, and three-dimensional distributions of plant area index, created using gap-fraction based estimation, had 0.5 m resolution for a cubic lattice. Individual tree measurements, including tree positions and diameter at breast height, were made from the scanner data with positions, on average, within 0.43 m and diameters within 5 cm of independent measurements, respectively. Our methods and results confirm that applications of ground-based laser scanning provide high-resolution, spatially-explicit measures of plot-level forest canopy structure.

                The distribution of laser pulses within conifer forest trees and canopies are examined by varying the rate of laser pulse emission and the inherent laser pulse properties (laser pulse energy, pulse width, pulse length, and roll-over or trigger time). In this study, an Optech, Inc. ALTM 3100 airborne lidar is used, emitting pulses at 50 kHz and 100 kHz, allowing for changes in laser pulse characteristics while also keeping all other survey parameters equal. We found that:1. Pulses and associated characteristics emitted at 50 kHz penetrated further into the canopy than 100 kHz for a significant number of individual trees.2. At tall tree plots with no understory, pulses emitted at 50 kHz penetrated further into the canopy than 100 kHz for a significant number of plots.3. For plots with significant understory and shorter trees, pulses emitted at 100 kHz penetrated further into the canopy than 50 kHz. We suspect that this may be due, in part, to canopy openness.Laser pulse energy and character differences associated with different laser pulse emission frequencies are likely a contributing factor in laser pulse penetration through the canopy to the ground surface. Efforts to understand laser pulse character influences on canopy returns are important as biomass and vegetation structure models derived from lidar are increasingly adopted.

                In this study, we present a new method for single tree segmentation and characterization from a canopy surface model (CSM), and its corresponding point cloud, based on airborne laser scanning. The method comprises new algorithms for controlling the shape of crown segments, and for residual adjustment of the canopy surface model (CSM). We present a new criterion that measures the success of locating trees, and demonstrate how this criterion can be used for optimizing the degree of CSM smoothing. From the adjusted CSM segments, we derived tree height and crown diameter, and based on all first laser pulse measurements within the segments we derived crown-base height. The method was applied and validated in a Norway spruce dominated forest reserve having a heterogeneous structure. The number of trees automatically detected varied with social status of the trees, from 93 percent of the dominant trees to 19 percent of the suppressed trees. The RMSE values for tree height, crown diameter, and crown-base height were around 1.2 m, 1.1 m, and 3.5 m, respectively. The method overestimated crown diameter (0.8 m) and crown base height (3.0 m).

                The success of a local maximum (LM) tree detection algorithm for detecting individual trees from lidar data depends on stand conditions that are often highly variable. A laser height variance and percent canopy cover (PCC) classification is used to segment the landscape by stand condition prior to stem detection. We test the performance of the LM algorithm using canopy height model (CHM) smoothing decisions and crown width estimation for each stand condition ranging from open savannah to multi-strata stands. Results show that CHM smoothing improves stem predictions for low density stands and no CHM smoothing better detects stems in dense even-aged stands, specifically dominant and co-dominant trees (R2= 0.61, RMSE = 20.91 stems with smoothing; R2= 0.85, RMSE = 46.02 stems with no-smoothing; combined smoothed CHM for low density and unsmoothed CHM for high density stands R2= 0.88, RMSE = 28.59 stems). At a threshold of approximately 2,200 stems ha–1, stem detection accuracy is no longer obtainable in any stand condition.

            Using Tree Clusters to Derive Forest Properties from Small Footprint Lidar Data

                This paper describes a new object-oriented small footprint lidar algorithm in which the objects of interest are tree clusters. The algorithm first thresholds the lidar canopy height model (CHM) at two levels to produce tree cluster grids. Next, two metrics are calculated based on these grids. The metric values are used in a multiple regression equation to predict the forest parameter of interest. To set the two thresholds, an optimization algorithm is used in conjunction with training data consisting of subsets of the CHM in which the forest parameters are known through ground measurements. A test of the algorithm was performed using ground and lidar data from a non-intensively managed loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantation in Virginia. The accuracies of the lidar-based predictions of density (0.01 ≤ R2≤ 0.80; 126 trees/ha ≤ RMSE ≤ 8,173 trees/ha) and biomass (0.04 ≤ R2≤ 0.62; 12.4 t/ha ≤ RMSE ≤ 316.5 t/ha) depended on the combination of metrics used, whether trees with a diameter at breast height < 10 cm were excluded from the analysis, and the number of plots used for training and testing. However, the fit between the ground measurements and tree cluster-based predictions generally exceeded the fit between ground measurements and the output from an individual tree-based algorithm tested using the same data (100 percent of comparable cases when density was predicted, 85 percent of comparable cases when biomass was predicted, based on the coefficient of determination and RMSE).

                Habitat quality is fundamental in ecology, but is difficult to quantify. Vegetation structure is a key characteristic of avian habitat, and can play a significant role in influencing habitat quality. Airborne lidar provides a means of measuring vegetation structure, supplying accurate data at high post-spacing and on a landscape-scale, which is impossible to achieve with field-based methods. We investigated how climate affected habitat quality using great tits (Parus major) breeding in woodland in eastern England. Mean chick body mass was used as a measure of habitat quality. Mean canopy height, calculated from a lidar digital canopy height model, was used as a measure of habitat structure. The influence of canopy height on body mass was examined for seven years during which weather conditions varied. The slopes and correlation coefficients of the mass/height relationships were related linearly to the warmth sum, an index of spring warmth, such that chick mass declined with canopy height in cold, late springs, but increased with height in warm, early springs. The parameters of the mass/height relationships, and the warmth sum, were also related linearly to the winter North Atlantic Oscillation index, but with a time lag of one year. Within the same wood, the structure conferring “best” habitat quality differed between years depending on weather conditions.

                NASA’s Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL) is a raster-scanning, waveform-resolving, green-wavelength (532 nm) lidar designed to map near-shore bathymetry, topography, and vegetation structure simultaneously. The EAARL sensor records the time history of the return waveform within a small footprint (20 cm diameter) for each laser pulse, enabling characterization of vegetation canopy structure and “bare earth” topography under a variety of vegetation types. A collection of individual waveforms combined within a synthesized large footprint was used to define three metrics: canopy height (CH), canopy reflection ratio (CRR), and height of median energy (HOME). Bare Earth Elevation (BEE) metric was derived using the individual small-footprint waveforms. All four metrics were tested for reproducibility, which resulted in an average of 95 percent correspondence within two standard deviations of the mean. CH and BEE values were also tested for accuracy using ground-truth data. The results presented in this paper show that combining several individual small-footprint laser pulses to define a composite “large-footprint” waveform is a possible method to depict the vertical structure of a vegetation canopy.
