                The new very high-resolution space satellite images, such as QuickBird and Ikonos, open new possibilities in cartographic applications. This work has as its main aim the assessment of a methodology to achieve the best possible geometric accuracy in orthorectified imagery products obtained from QuickBird basic imagery which will include an assessment of the methodology’s reliability. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), mean error or bias, and maximum error in 79 independent check points are computed and utilized as accuracy indicators.The ancillary data were generated by high accuracy methods: (a) check and control points were measured with a differential global positioning system, and (b) a dense digital elevation model (DEM) with grid spacing of 2 m and RMSEzof about 0.31 m generated from a photogrammetric aerial flight at an approximate scale of 1:5000 that was used for image orthorectification. Two other DEMs with a grid spacing of 5 m (RMSEz= 1.75 m) and 20 m (RMSEz= 5.82 m) were also used.Four 3D geometric correction models were used to correct the satellite data: two terrain-independent rational function models refined by the user, a terrain-dependent model, and a rigorous physical model. The number and distribution of the ground control points (GCPs) used for the sensor orientation were studied as well, testing from 9 to 45 GCPs. The best results obtained about the geometric accuracy of the orthorectified images (two dimensional RMSE of about 0.74 m) were computed when the dense DEM was used with the 3D physical and terrain-dependent models. The use of more than 18 GCPs does not improve the results when those GCPs are extracted by stratified random sampling.

                The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) has provided homogeneous and highly accurate data for Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). It is important to realize that the SRTM DEM represents the Earth’s surface (vegetation, snow) as seen by a C-band SAR in February 2000 and not necessarily the bare terrain. The accuracy of the DEMs depends on various factors including the terrain roughness/slope, land-cover, snow/ice, and vegetation. Herein, an accuracy assessment of the C-band SRTM DEM is performed through comparisons with independent elevation data obtained from the laser altimetry mission ICESat (4.7 million footprints) and terrestrial height information at 33,000 survey control monuments in Alberta, Canada. Temporal elevation changes due to snow cover and vegetation are considered and presented for the provinces of Quebec and Alberta. The analysis focuses on both data and datum issues, which are required to provide a realistic assessment of the achievable accuracy.

                Model estimates of impervious area as a function of landcover area may be biased and imprecise because of errors in the land-cover classification. This investigation of the effects of land-cover misclassification on impervious surface models that use National Land Cover Data (NLCD) evaluates the consequences of adjusting land-cover within a watershed to reflect uncertainty assessment information. Model validation results indicate that using error-matrix information to adjust land-cover values used in impervious surface models does not substantially improve impervious surface predictions. Validation results indicate that the resolution of the landcover data (Level I and Level II) is more important in predicting impervious surface accurately than whether the land-cover data have been adjusted using information in the error matrix. Level I NLCD, adjusted for land-cover misclassification, is preferable to the other land-cover options for use in models of impervious surface. This result is tied to the lower classification error rates for the Level I NLCD.

                This study proposes a new metric called canopy geometric volume G, which is derived from small-footprint lidar data, for estimating individual-tree basal area and stem volume. Based on the plant allometry relationship, we found that basal area B is exponentially related to G (B = β1G3/4, where β1is a constant) and stem volume V is proportional to G (V = β2G, where β2is a constant). The models based on these relationships were compared with a number of models based on tree height and/or crown diameter. The models were tested over individual trees in a deciduous oak woodland in California in the case that individual tree crowns are either correctly or incorrectly segmented. When trees are incorrectly segmented, the theoretical model B = β1G3/4has the best performance (adjusted R2, R2a= 0.78) and the model V = β2G has the second to the best performance (R2a= 0.78). When trees are correctly segmented, the theoretical models are among the top three models for estimating basal area (R2a= 0.77) and stem volume (R2a= 0.79). Overall, these theoretical models are the best when considering a number of factors such as the performance, the model parsimony, and the sensitivity to errors in tree crown segmentation. Further research is needed to test these models over sites with multiple species.

            A Theoretical Approach to Modeling the Accuracy Assessment of Digital Elevation Models

                In this paper, a theoretical analysis is presented of the degree of correctness to which the accuracy figures of a grid Digital Elevation Model (DEM) have been estimated, measured as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) depending on the number of checkpoints used in the accuracy assessment process. The latter concept is sometimes referred to as the Reliability of the DEM accuracy tests.Two theoretical models have been developed for estimating the reliability of the DEM accuracy figures using the number of checkpoints and parameters related to the statistical distribution of residuals (mean, variance, skewness, and standardized kurtosis). A general case was considered in which residuals might be weakly correlated (local spatial autocorrelation) with non-zero mean and non-normal distribution. Thus, we avoided the “strong assumption” of distribution normality accepted in some of the previous works and in the majority of the current standards of positional accuracy control methods.Sampled data were collected using digital photogrammetric methods applied to large scale stereo imagery (1:5 000). In this way, seven morphologies were sampled with a 2 m by 2 m sampling interval, ranging from flat (3 percent average slope) to the highly rugged terrain of marble quarries (82 percent average slope).Two local schemes of interpolation have been employed, using Multiquadric Radial Basis Functions (MRBF) and Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolators, to generate interpolated surfaces from high-resolution grid DEMs. The theoretical results obtained were experimentally validated using the Monte Carlo simulation method.The proposed models provided a good fit for the raw simulated data for the seven morphologies and the two schemes of interpolation tested (r2> 0.96 as mean value). The proposed theoretical models performed very well for modeling the non-gaussian distribution of the errors at the checkpoints, a property which is very common in geographically distributed data.

                This paper proposes a technique to extract urban built-up land features from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery taking two cities in southeastern China as examples. The study selected three indices, Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) to represent three major urban land-use classes, built-up land, open water body, and vegetation, respectively. Consequently, the seven bands of an original Landsat image were reduced into three thematic-oriented bands derived from above indices. The three new bands were then combined to compose a new image. This considerably reduced data correlation and redundancy between original multispectral bands, and thus significantly avoided the spectral confusion of the above three land-use classes. As a result, the spectral signatures of the three urban land-use classes are more distinguishable in the new composite image than in the original seven-band image as the spectral clusters of the classes are well separated. Through a supervised classification, a principal components analysis, or a logic calculation on the new image, the urban built-up lands were finally extracted with overall accuracy ranging from 91.5 to 98.5 percent. Therefore, the technique is effective and reliable. In addition, the advantages of SAVI over NDVI and MNDWI over NDWI in the urban study are also discussed in this paper.

                Numerous approaches have been developed to quantify the distribution of impervious surfaces using remote sensing technologies. Most of these approaches have been applied to data from a single time period, typically in the summer season (June to September). Presently, it is not clear whether there is an optimal time for impervious surface estimation with these methods. In this paper, the seasonal sensitivity of impervious surface estimation is examined. In particular, Landsat TM/ETM+ imagery for four different seasons has been acquired for the environs of Franklin County, Ohio. Two impervious surface estimation methods, spectral mixture analysis and regression modeling, are used to test for seasonal variations. Results indicate that the summer image provides better accuracy with the spectral mixture analysis method, while consistent accuracies are obtained for all four seasons with regression modeling.

                We examine the potential of supplementing per-pixel classifiers with the Getis index (Gi) in comparison to the Geary’s C on a subset of Ikonos imagery for urban land-use and landcover classification. The test is pertinent considering that the Gi is generally considered more capable of identifying clusters of points with similar attributes. We quantify the impact of varying distance thresholds on the classification product and demonstrate how well the Gi identified cold and hot spots in comparison to Geary’s C. The exercise also provides a rule of thumb for effectively measuring spatial association in connection to adjacency. We are able to support existing literature that measuring local variability improves classification over spectral information alone. The results, however, neither confirm nor deny the challenge on whether measuring cold and hot spots rather than just spatial association improves classification accuracy.

                This paper summarises a research project that examined the usefulness of Object-oriented Programming (OOP) and the Unified Modelling Language (UML) in producing welldesigned software. This leads to the cost effective implementation of new automated mapping tools as and when they emerge. In this project, software for an automated mapping system was designed, implemented and successfully tested. The system consists of the following subsystems: (a) image acquisition, (b) positioning, (c) image point referencing, (d) spatial object extraction, and, (e) visualization. This paper addresses parts of this work (the first three subsystems) in order to demonstrate the flexibility of this approach to software design.
