                Research goals were to analyze patterns of urban landscape water use, assess landscape water conservation potential, and identify locations with capacity to conserve. Methodological contributions involved acquiring airborne multispectral digital images over two urban cities which were processed, classified, and imported into a GIS environment where landscaped areas were extracted and combined with property and water billing data and local evapotranspiration rates to calculate landscape irrigation applications exceeding estimated water needs. Additional analyses were conducted to compare classified aerial images to ground-measured landscaped areas, landscaped areas to total parcel size, water use on residential and commercial properties, and turf areas under trees when they were leafed out and bare. Results verified the accuracy and value of this approach for municipal water management, showed more commercial properties applied water in excess of estimated needs compared to residential ones, and that small percentages of users accounted for most of the excess irrigation.

                The extensive distribution of bamboo forests in Southern and Southeast Asia plays an important role in carbon sequestration and climate change. Providing timely and accurate estimates for aboveground carbon (AGC) of Moso bamboo forests is an urgent task. Based on the integration of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and field inventory data, this study explores use of the k Nearest Neighbors (KNN) technique for estimating AGC. A new distance metric named Slope, Intercept, and Correlation Distance (SICD) is introduced and compared with Euclidean Distance (ED) and Mahalanobis Distance (MD). Using leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation, the estimation performance of KNN technique is then compared with a linear regression model. The research indicates that the SICD is slightly better than ED and MD but no significant differences were found between them in estimating AGC. For extreme AGC conditions, the KNN technique has a greater estimation performance than that of the linear regression model, and is a convenient and effective method for estimating AGC of Moso bamboo forests in a large area.

                We studied the use of daily satellite data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors to assess wetland forest damage and recovery from Hurricane Katrina (29 August 2005 landfall). Processed MODIS daily vegetation index (VI) trends were consistent with previously determined impact and recovery patterns provided by the “snapshot” 25 m Landsat Thematic Mapper optical and RADARSAT-1 synthetic aperture radar satellite data. Phenological trends showed high 2004 and 2005 pre-hurricane temporal correspondence within bottomland hardwood forest communities, except during spring green-up, and temporal dissimilarity between these hardwoods and nearby cypress-tupelo swamp forests (Taxodium distichum [baldcypress] and Nyssa aquatica [water tupelo]). MODIS VI trend analyses established that one year after impact, cypress-tupelo and lightly impacted hardwood forests had recovered to near pre-hurricane conditions. In contrast, canopy recovery lagged in the moderately and severely damaged hardwood forests, possibly reflecting regeneration of pre-hurricane species and stand-level replacement by invasive trees.

            A Volumetric Approach to Population Estimation Using Lidar Remote Sensing

                This research investigated the applicability of lidar data for estimating population at the census block level using a volumetric approach. The study area, near the urban downtown area of Denver, Colorado, was selected since it includes dense distribution of different types of residential buildings. A modified morphological building detection algorithm was proposed to extract buildings from the lidar-derived surfaces. The extraction results showed that the modified morphological building detection algorithm can effectively recover building pixels occluded by nearby trees. The extracted buildings were further refined to residential buildings using parcel data. Two approaches (i.e., area- and volume-based) to population estimation were investigated at the census block level. Four regression models (i.e., simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, regression tree using one variable, and regression tree using multiple variables) were used to identify the relationship between census population and the area or volume information of the residential buildings. The volume-based models overwhelmingly outperformed the area-based models in the study area, and the models using multiple variables yielded more accurate estimation than the single variable models. The volume-based regression tree model using multiple variables yielded the most accurate estimations: R2=0.89, RMSE=21 people, and RRMSE=26.8 percent in the calibration site; and R2=0.80, RMSE=27 people, and RRMSE=30.1 percent in the validation site. As the results show, the volumetric approach using lidar remote sensing is effective for population estimation in regions with heterogeneous housing characteristics.

            Automatic Georeferencing of Aerial Images Using Stereo High-Resolution Satellite Images

                For airborne surveys, the GPS/INS system has become the primary source for aerial image georeferencing. However, alternative automated georeferencing is required to serve as a backup for georeferencing when GPS/INS-based georeferencing is not feasible. High-resolution satellite images (HRSI) have been globally available with better spatial resolution and increasing positional accuracy. Therefore, HRSI has high potential as a ground control source for aerial image georeferencing which usually requires accurate 3D ground control points. Unfortunately, single imagery, which is often used as a reference, contains relief displacement due to objects on the ground introducing positional errors, unless it is not true ortho-rectified which is costly and time consuming. Therefore, in this study, a stereo HRSI-based automated georeferencing approach is proposed. The use of stereo images can avoid the impact of relief displacement and requires no external height information. The proposed method is based on a multi-scale image matching approach utilizing a combination of SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) and RANSAC (RANdom SAmple Consensus). In the georeferencing step, the bundle adjustment with outlier removal of Baarda’s data snooping was utilized. Experimental results for a strip of aerial images with stereo Ikonos images showed its potential as a backup system for automated georeferencing.

                The recent economic crisis in United States has led to an increase in home foreclosures and subsequent abandonments. A by-product of this trend has been an associated rise in the number of neglected swimming pools, which provide new habitats for the larval stages of the Culex mosquito vectors of West Nile Virus (WNV) in urban and suburban environments. WNV has been major concern related to neglected swimming pools in California. Our research focused on using very high spatial resolution (VHR) satellite imagery and processing techniques, including image pansharpening, normalized difference water index, and geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA), to develop a geographic information system (GIS) database of swimming pool locations. This research demonstrated that GEOBIA with VHR imagery could produce a GIS database of swimming pools with the high accuracy of 94 percent. The analytic approach of this research is expected to economically facilitate the location of swimming pools for ground inspection and mosquito control.
