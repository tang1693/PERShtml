                The density and uniformity of lidar data play crucial roles in the cor-responding data processing steps. One factor influencing point density and spacing in lidar data is the presence of empty pulses, where no return is detected. Missing returns can occur due to atmospheric absorption, specular and diffusive reflection, etc. To address this issue and enhance point density, this paper introduces a novel method for approximating missing returns in airborne lidar data collected over urban areas. This technique focuses on approximating returns for empty pulses that hit spots near abrupt slope changes on building and ground surfaces. The proposed methodology is validated through experiments using a lidar data set from downtown Dublin, Ireland. The collected data contained numerous gaps associated with wet surfaces, as well as missing returns on vertical and oblique surfaces.

                This article presents recommendations and corresponding detailed procedures for the assessment of a geolocation system's accuracy, as well as the specification of accuracy requirements and their subsequent validation when they are available. Applicable metrics and related processing are based on samples of corresponding geolocation errors. This article also presents similar recommendations for the predicted accuracy of a geolocation system, based on samples of geolocation error, as well as corresponding predicted error covariance matrices associated with the geolocations. Reliable error covariance matrices enable optimal use of a geolocation system's products, such as the optimal fusion of multiple geolocations or multiple products for higher confidence and increased accuracy. The recommendations presented in this article enable reliable estimates of accuracy and reliable predicted accuracies, both of which are critical to many geolocation-based applications. The recommendations associated with predicted accuracy are also relatively new and innovative.

            A Keyframe Extraction Approach for 3D Videogrammetry Based on Baseline Constraints

                In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the extraction of high-quality frames to enhance the fidelity of videogrammetry by combining fuzzy frames removal and baseline constraints. We first implement a gradient-based mutual information method to filter out low-quality frames while preserving the integrity of the videos. After frame pose estimation, the geometric properties of the baseline are constrained by three aspects to extract the keyframes: quality of relative orientation, baseline direction, and base to distance ratio. The three-dimensional model is then reconstructed based on these extracted keyframes. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach maintains a strong robustness throughout the aerial triangulation, leading to high levels of reconstruction precision across diverse video scenarios. Compared to other methods, this paper improves the reconstruction accuracy by more than 0.2 mm while simultaneously maintaining the completeness.

                To extract terraced fields in hilly areas on a large scale in an automated and high-precision manner, this paper proposes a terrace extraction method that combines the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Sentinel-2 imagery, and the improved U-Net semantic segmentation model. The U-Net model is modified by introducing Attention Gate modules into its decoding modules to suppress the interference of redundant features and adding Dropout and Batch Normalization layers to improve training speed, robustness, and fitting ability. In addition, the DEM band is combined with the red, green, and blue bands of the remote sensing images to make full use of terrain information. The experimental results show that the Precision, Recall, F1 score, and Mean Intersection over Union of the proposed method for terrace extraction are improved to other mainstream advanced methods, and the internal information of the terraces extracted is more complete, with fewer false positive and false negative results.
