                Urbanization process has a huge impact on vegetation dynamics in urban ecosystems. Ecosystem services provided by urban green space have been increasingly incorporated into city-level measures to address climate change. Understanding the relationship between urban green space (UGS) and urban impervious surface (UIS) as well as land surface temperature (LST ) is crucial to the understanding of urban spatial morphology. To better understand the impact of different spatial configurations on the urban heat island effect at different scales, this study constructed the spatial configuration of UIS and UGS on four grids of different scales and explored their relationship with LST in sea- sonal changes. The results show that different indicators present significant characteristic disparity under the four grid scales, compared with other scales, indicators have a relative stability correlation at 1 km. In addition, trees and grass, as different urban green spaces, have notable negative effects on surface temperature. At grid 3 (G3) scale, grassland had a strong correlation with LST in aggregation index and landscape shape index, which were 0.473 and 0.648, suggesting that fine-scale planning is of great significance to alleviating the urban heat island effect. This study can assist in designing sustainable cities by providing insights into urban green space planning and management.

                Economic development and climate change drive the land use and land cover (LULC) change globally. Annual robust maps of LULC are critical for studying climate change and land–climate interaction. However, the current existing methods for optimizing and expanding the publicly available China land cover data set (CLCD) are limited. In this article, 30-m annual LULC changes are obtained from 1990 to 2020 in the Yangtze River basin (YRB). The results show an overall accuracy rate of 82.66% and better performances on Geo-Wiki test samples when compared to similar products. Based on our 30-m annual LULC data set, the drastic LULC changes are found in YRB over a 30-year period, where impervious surface area more than tripled, cropland area decreased by 6.12%, and water area decreased by 6.09%. In addition, through the geographically and temporally weighted regression method, a fitting model with a goodness of fit of 0.91 well reveals that human activity plays a driving role in the LULC change of YRB.

            A Boundary-Based Ground-Point Filtering Method for Photogrammetric Point-Cloud Data

                Ground-point filtering from point-cloud data is an important process in remote sensing and the photogrammetric map-production line, especially in generating digital elevation models from airborne lidar and aerial photogrammetric point-cloud data. In this article, a new and simple boundary-based method is proposed for ground-point filtering from the photogrammetric point-cloud data. The proposed method uses the local height difference to extract the boundaries of objects. Then the extracted boundary points are traced to generate polygons around the borders of any objects on the ground. Finally, the points located inside these polygons, which are classified as non-ground points, are filtered. The experimental results on the photogrammetric point cloud show that the proposed method can adapt to complex environments. The total error of the proposed method is about 8.96%, which is promising in these challenging data sets. Moreover, the proposed method is compared with cloth simulation filtering, multi-scale curvature classification, and gLiDAR methods and gives better results.

                In modern society, energy conservation is an important consideration for sustainability. The availability of energy-efficient infrastructures and utilities depend on the sustainability of smart cities. The big streaming data generated and collected by smart building devices and systems contain useful information that needs to be used to make timely action and better decisions. The ultimate objective of these procedures is to enhance the city's sustainability and livability. The replacement of decades-old infrastructures, such as underground wiring, steam pipes, transportation tunnels, and high-speed Internet installation, is already a major problem for major urban regions. There are still certain regions in big cities where broadband wireless service is not available. The decision support system is recently acquiring increasing attention in the smart city context. In this article, a deep learning–based sustainable decision support system (DLSDSS) has been proposed for energy building in smart cities. This study proposes the integration of the Internet of Things into smart buildings for energy management, utilizing deep learning methods for sensor information decision making. Building a socially advanced environment aims to enhance city services and urban administration for residents in smart cities using remote sensing techniques. The proposed deep learning methods classify buildings based on energy efficiency. Data gathered from the sensor network to plan smart cities' development include a deep learning algorithm's structural assembly of data. The deep learning algorithm provides decision makers with a model for the big data stream. The numerical results show that the proposed method reduces energy consumption and enhances sensor data accuracy by 97.67% with better decision making in planning smart infrastructures and services. The experimental outcome of the DLSDSS enhances accuracy (97.67%), time complexity (98.7%), data distribution rate (97.1%), energy consumption rate (98.2%), load shedding ratio (95.8%), and energy efficiency (95.4%).

                The automatic extraction of urban buildings based on remote sensing images is important for urban dynamic monitoring, planning, and management. The deep learning has significantly helped improve the accuracy of building extraction. Most remote sensing image segmentation methods are based on convolution neural networks, which comprise encoding and decoding structures. However, the convolution operation cannot learn the remote spatial correlation. Herein we propose the Shift Window Attention of building SWAB-net based on the transformer model to solve the semantic segmentation of building objects. Moreover, the shift window strategy was adopted to determine buildings using urban satellite images with 4 m resolution to extract the features of sequence images efficiently and accurately. We evaluated the proposed network on SpaceNet 7, and the results of comprehensive analysis showed that the network is conducive for efficient remote sensing image research.
