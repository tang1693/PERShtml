                Indoor navigation applications have become widespread in recent years with the ability of mobile phones which determine the position. Due to the inefficiency of global positioning system (GPS) indoors, other positioning methods have been developed based on local networks using technologies such as Bluetooth, wireless networks, ultra-wideband signals, ultrasonic signals, and radio frequency identification modules. Various technologies yield high or medium accuracy. Combining data from multiple sources via fusion enhances location precision. In this study, indoor positions were estimated using trilateration with Bluetooth devices, and the accuracy was improved by applying filters to the data from inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors on the phone. As a result of combining Bluetooth and IMU data with data fusion, submeter accuracy was achieved. The results obtained were tested at Yildiz Technical University-Istanbul Türkiye. It was determined that 92% of the data was obtained with submeter accuracy.

                Accurate and effective rice identification has great significance for the sustainable development of agricultural management and food security. This paper proposes an accurate rice identification method that can solve the confused problem between fragmented rice fields and the surroundings in complex surface areas. The spectral, temporal, and spatial features extracted from the created Sentinel-2 time series were integrated and collaboratively displayed in the form of visual images, and a convolutional neural network model embedded with integrated information was established to further mine the key information that distinguishes rice from other types. The results showed that the overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the proposed method for rice identification reached 99.4%, 99.5%, 99.5%, and 99.5%, respectively, achieving a better performance than the support vector machine classifier. Therefore, the proposed method can effectively reduce the confusion between rice and other types and accurately extract rice distribution information under complex surface conditions.

                Cultural heritage building information modeling (HBIM) is an emerging process allowing us to reconstruct built heritage virtually. The data of a digitally documented cultural heritage building offers significant advantages as it is accessible and modifiable by all professionals involved in the same or different projects. The most important factor affecting the accuracy and precision of the HBIM model is the ability to collect complete and accurate information about the physical structure. Combining terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry point clouds is one of the most efficient ways to capture accurate digital data on the building. This study provides the foundation for creating an HBIM model for cultural heritage the coupling of spatial data with TLS and UAV. This paper aims to generate synergy between TLS and UAV point cloud data and ensure that the spatial database contains sufficient data to model historical objects with HBIM tendencies.

                Despite much valuable research on the mechanisms for spatio-temporal changesof net primary vegetation productivity (NPP) and net ecosystem productivity (NEP), there is a paucity of information on assessing impacts of regional multiple factors on spatiotemporal researchs of NPP and NEP in the complex environment. This study attempts to bridge this information gap using the Jianghuai Basin in China as a case study. Using a field campaign, remotely sensed imagery, socioeconomic data, and meteorological parameters, we developed a framework based on the Carnegie‐Ames‐Stanford Approach (CASA) model, correlation technique, trend analysis, and landscape metrics to measure spatiotemporal changes in NPP and NEP from 2001 to 2018. The derived changes were then linked to regional multiple factors including climate, landscape factors, human activity, and land use change. The results of the research can provide a scientific basis for vegetation evaluation, ecosystem assessment, and other aspects of the region.
