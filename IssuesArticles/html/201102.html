                A novel approach by integrating multi-view aerial imagery and lidar data is proposed to reconstruct 3D building models with accurate geometric position and fine details. First, a new algorithm is introduced for determination of principal orientations of a building, thus benefiting to improve the correctness and robustness of boundary segment extraction in aerial imagery. A new dynamic selection strategy based on lidar point density analysis and K-means clustering is then proposed to identify boundary segments from non-boundary segments. Second, 3D boundary segments are determined by incorporating lidar data and the 2D segments extracted from multi-view imagery. Finally, a new strategy for 3D building model reconstruction including automatic recovery of lost boundaries and robust reconstruction of rooftop patches is introduced. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach can provide high quality 3D models with high-correctness, high-completeness, and good geometric accuracy.

            National Land-Cover Data and Census of Agriculture Estimates of Agricultural Land-Use Area Differ in the Northeastern United States

                The landscape of the northeastern United States is a complex mixture of forest, agriculture, and development. Many urgent social and environmental issues require spatially-referenced information on land-use, a need potentially met by the National Land-Cover Data (NLCD). NLCD non-site-specific accuracy from 1992 and 2001 was assessed by comparing county proportions of cropland and agricultural grassland (pasture/hay) area to those recorded in the USDA Census of Agriculture (COA) for 1992 and 2002. Estimates of total agricultural area corresponded closely (r2= 0.91 for 1992; 0.85 for 2001/2), but NLCD performed poorly at distinguishing between cropland and grassland (r2= 0.64 and 0.80 for cropland in 1992 and 2001; 0.50 and 0.44 for grassland in those years). High forest cover reduced accuracy. Landscape complexity and patch size may impede classification accuracy. Accuracy varied greatly by state, even within a single mapping region. The NLCD is the best available source of spatial land-cover, but may not be suitable for applications requiring agricultural subclass data.

                This paper attempts to quantify soil moisture in various canopy cover conditions using n-dimensional spectral signatures, including land surface temperature, vegetation index, albedo, and others. First, the feature vector between the pixels and various moisture contents was indentified. Normalization of the varying distance from a user-defined initial state to any pixel location, and coefficients related with n-dimensional spectral feature space were calculated, assigning weights to each parameter. Then, a soil moisture index was developed using a linear combination of the first order polynomials. The Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (eFAST) was used to calculate the relative variance contribution of model input parameters to the variance of soil moisture predictions. Results derived from satellite data including Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery demonstrated significant correlations between the index and soil moisture obtained for different ecosystems and vegetation cover. The best agreement, the coefficient of determination (R2), between the index and soil moisture were 0.58 and 0.65 for ETM+ and MODIS data, respectively. eFAST sensitivity analysis indicates that land surface temperature might be the most determinant factor in soil moisture estimation, then albedo, followed by NDVI.

            Validation of ASTER GDEM for the Area of Greece

                The ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM), which was released in June 2009, provides elevation data for over 99 percent of Earthâ€™s land area. GDEM was found to contain significant anomalies mainly caused by residual clouds in the ASTER scenes, or by the algorithm used to generate the final GDEM from the variable number of individual DEMs. In this paper, the GDEM, for the whole area of Greece was validated by comparing it with reference DEMs with higher resolution derived either from aerial stereo imagery, or from ASTER raw data analysis; as well as with elevation values provided by a number of Geodetic Control Points (GCP) and GPS measurements. The vertical accuracy (at 95 percent confidence) was calculated to be more than 30 m (RMSE = 16.01 m) when compared to the GCPs, whereas the vertical accuracy was calculated around 20 m (RMSE = 11.08 m) when compared with the GPS derived elevations. It can be therefore stated that the current version of ASTER GDEM overall does not meet its pre-production estimated vertical accuracy of 20 m at 95 percent confidence over Greece, however, it can be used in several applications, such as topographic analysis, hydrological and geomorphological modeling, landscape visualization, and energy balance studies.

            A Genetic Algorithm Approach to Moving Threshold Optimization for Binary Change Detection

                This study investigated the use of a genetic algorithm (GA) approach, a widely used optimization method, to identify optimum thresholds for remote sensing-based binary change detection. Automated GA-based calibration models using a moving threshold window (MTW) were developed and tested using a case study. Two sets of the bi-temporal QuickBird imagery were used to evaluate the new optimization models. The GA-based models using MTW were free from the assumption of symmetry of thresholds for difference- or ratio-type of change-enhanced images, unlike traditional binary change detection methods, allowing more flexibility and efficiency in selecting optimum thresholds. Exhaustive search techniques using symmetric threshold window (STW) and MTW were evaluated for comparison. The stability of the GA-based models in terms of accuracy variation was also examined. The GA-based calibration models successfully identified optimum thresholds without a significant decrease in accuracy. The GA-based models using MTW outperformed the GA-based model using STW in both calibration and validation, revealing that optimum thresholds tended to be asymmetric. Multiple change-enhanced images generally resulted in better performance than single change-enhanced images based on the GA-based models.

            Utilizing Temporally Invariant Calibration Sites to Classify Multiple Dates and Types of Satellite Imagery

                Mapping past time periods (retrospective mapping) using remotely sensed data is hindered by a lack of coincident calibration and validation information. The identification of features of same ground cover invariant across time and their use as calibration and validation data addresses this challenge by: (a) streamlining the process of image calibration for multiple dates, and (b) allowing each image to generate its own spectral signature. This study investigates the use of temporally invariant calibration and validation data to map land-cover in Massachusetts, employing five satellite images collected from five separate dates and different sensors. The results indicate that this technique can be used to produce land cover classifications of similar overall map accuracy to published mapping studies. Classification accuracy using this method is highly dependent on the characteristics (radiometric, spectral, and spatial) of the satellite imagery.
