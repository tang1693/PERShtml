                The three-dimensional (3D) modeling of power lines is one of the most critical processing steps for identifying vegetation encroachment on high-voltage power lines, which often results in electrical shock hazards, fires, and outages, as well as verifying the current capacity of existing power lines and thus supplying the increasing demand for electricity. Today’s state-of-the art techniques are used to reconstruct power line models, however, still require human intervention to a certain extent, which hinders the rapid response needed for effectively managing power line risks. We propose an alternative solution to automate the procedures to reconstruct a 3D power line model from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data. The proposed method starts by extracting power line candidate points, which are converted into a catenary curve model representing a power line. This initial model is allowed to progressively grow to produce a complete power line model by producing hypothetical growing models and selecting optimal one. A stochastic constrained non-linear adjustment method is developed for estimating catenary curve model parameters. An evaluation of the proposed approach over a complex power line scene demonstrates that the proposed method is promising for automatically reconstructing 3D power line model from ALS data, and thus provides benefits for efficient and reliable power line risk management.

            Application of Lidar Terrain Surfaces for Soil Moisture Modeling

                Soil moisture gradients and nutrient fertility are used to classify forest types in Ontario, Canada based on ecological land classification (ELC). An existing lidar dataset for the Romeo Malette Forest near Timmins, Ontario was used to derive three terrain indices (topographic wetness index (TWI), percent elevation index (PEI), and canopy height model (CHM)) at varying resolutions (2 m, 5 m, 10 m and 20 m) to determine the resolution that best characterizes soil moisture patterns in a boreal forest landscape. Depression removal algorithms were examined to determine how they affect the TWI, and thus, soil moisture estimation. This paper stresses the importance of gathering data at a resolution that is sufficient for mapping fine-scale basin features to accurately model soil moisture in forested environments. The results of this research indicate that 5 m resolution data provided the best overall relationship with measured seasonal soil moisture. More generally, the results indicate that high spatial resolution variables (i.e., 2 m, 5 m) may be more suited to modeling soil moisture trends at shallow depths (0 to 15 cm), while coarser resolutions (i.e., 10 m, 20 m) may be more adept at resolving trends over greater depths (0 to 40 cm).

                The aim of this study was to use an analytical approach to monitor water quality in an Iowa lake using multitemporal Hyperion satellite imagery. Cloud-free hyperspectral images were acquired from the Hyperion sensor on individual days in June, July, and August of 2006. Water samples with accurate locations using GPS were collected simultaneously with image acquisition. Water samples were analyzed for various water quality constituents. Chlorophyll-a (CHL), was estimated for each sampling date using a bio-optical model with Specific Inherent Optical Properties (SIOPs) of the lake and light field variables derived from a radiative transfer numerical model. The model was then applied to the Hyperion images to create spatially continuous CHL maps for the study area every month. These results were compared with traditional linear regression model outputs. Maps produced using the bio-optical model effectively demonstrated spatial and temporal variability of CHL for the lake. The CHL concentration from this model across the lake ranged from 28 to 121μg/L for the month of June, 18 to 111μg/L for July, and 31 to 125μg/L for August. The validation and accuracy assessment for the bio-optical model with in-situ data showed R2values of 0.90978, 0.96794 and 0.93057 for June, July, and August, respectively, and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient values of 0.499478, 0.733072, and 0.878757 for June, July, and August, respectively.

            Determination of Optimum Classifier and Feature Subset in Hyperspectral Images based on Ant Colony System

                Recent advances in hyperspectral remote sensing technology allow the discrimination of complex land-cover classes that have similar spectral reflectance. The reliability and robustness of Support Vector Machines (SVM) in high dimensional space makes it an efficient tool for the classification of hyperspectral images. However, two optimization issues have a strong effect on the SVM performance: optimum parameter determination and optimum feature subset selection. There is an intricate relationship between these two issues, and we propose in this paper to determine the SVM parameters and the feature subset simultaneously by Ant Colony System (ACS). We compare our approach with three powerful meta-heuristic optimization algorithms, namely, Simulated Annealing (SA), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Bees Algorithm (BA). Experimental results with two AVIRIS datasets clearly demonstrate the superiority of the ACS algorithm in that it improves the classification accuracy and decreases the size of the selected feature subset. In both datasets the classification accuracy improves by about 7 percent and 95 redundant bands are eliminated.

            Automated Delineation of Individual Tree Crowns from Lidar Data by Multi-Scale Analysis and Segmentation

                A canopy height model (CHM) derived from lidar data can be segmented to obtain individual tree crowns. However, branches, tree crowns, and tree clusters usually have similar shapes and overlapping sizes. This causes current individual tree crown delineation methods for CHMs to work less effectively on closed canopy deciduous or mixed wood forests consisting of various-sized tree crowns. Based on mult-scale analysis and segmentation, an innovative tree crown delineation method was developed in this study. In this method, the scale levels of target tree crowns are first morphologically determined; the CHM is filtered at the multiple scale levels; and local maxima within each filtered CHM are taken as markers to segment the original CHM using the marker-controlled watershed method. After tree crown segments are selected from the multiple resulting segmentation maps and integrated together, a complete tree crown map is generated. In an experiment on natural forests in Ontario, Canada, the proposed method yielded crown maps having a good consistency with manual and visual interpretation. For instance, when compared to a manually delineated forest map, the automated method correctly delineated about 69 percent, 65 percent, and 73 percent of the tree crowns from plots of closed canopy coniferous, deciduous, and mixed wood forests, respectively.

                A photogrammetric system of four webcams was developed to acquire craniofacial measurements of newborn babies. The errors between a set of photogrammetrically-derived measurements on a clinical mannequin with those made by an experienced nursing sister were found to be negligible (less than 0.5 mm) at the 5 percent level of significance. The four cameras were individually calibrated and the parameters and distortion patterns compared. To assess the impact of camera calibration, the validation imagery was also processed with both average and nominal calibration parameter sets. It was found that the average parameter set produced measurement errors similar to those produced by the individual calibrations, but using the nominal calibration set produced less accurate measurements. The project demonstrates that a low-cost photogrammetric system is as accurate as manual measurements and at the same time provides a safe, non-contact measurement environment and a visual record of the subjects.
