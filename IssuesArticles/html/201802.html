                There are two strategies for generating high-resolution vegetation index time series using spatiotemporal data blending methods, named as "Blend-then-Index" (BI) and "Indexthen-Blend" (IB), according to the order of vegetation index calculation and data blending. This study aims to determine which strategy can obtain better results for generating a high-resolution normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series using the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM). The theoretical error analysis suggests that the more accurate strategy depends on the vegetation growth stages:BIhas a smaller error thanIBwhen theNDVIvalues at the prediction date are higher than the input NDVI values and vice versa. Simulated experiments using Landsat images were conducted to verify the theoretical analysis. This study provides guidelines for producing better high-resolution vegetation index time series usingSTARFM.

                This study seeks to determine the most effective operational approach for detection and delineation of fine-scale crack damage to critical infrastructure using rapid, semi-automated image analysis methods. The effectiveness of these methods is tested using both single-date (post-event only) imagery and bitemporal (pre- and post-event) image pairs to validate benefits associated with the collection of baseline imagery and corresponding camera station locations needed to employ bi-temporal, change detection based on the repeat station imaging (RSI) approach. This study is the first to compare a variety of image processing methods of detecting and delineating cracks using bi-temporal, aerial images of complex scenes as input. Methods employing a bi-temporal, change detection approach outperform techniques relying on single-date imagery only. With a producer's accuracy of 77.9 percent and user's accuracy of 69.1 percent, a pixel-based image difference model using kernel based spatial filters is the most successful and is suitable for automated, near real-time implementation.

                Upscaling land cover maps is broadly employed to fill data gaps or match the spatial-resolution of preexisting projects. However, existing methods introduce systematic errors in the area information and the landscape pattern. We developed an upscaling method fusing the spatial structure information (i.e., class Membership probability) and the uncertainty information of the base map (e.g., Confidence level probability), called Fusing class Membership probability and Confidence level probability (FMC). The results showed thatFMCobtained higher upscaling efficiency, and mitigated the negative influence of landscape heterogeneity and the negative influence of unequal proportions of land cover in the base maps, on the upscaling compared to Majority Rule Based (MRB) method. Additionally,FMCcan reduce the uncertainty/error when these upscaled maps are used as input to Earth observation model (e.g., land cover change).

            Removing Rural Roads from the National Land Cover Database to Create Improved Urban Maps for the United States, 1992 to 2011

                Quantifying change in urban land provides important information to create empirical models examining the effects of human land use. Maps of developed land from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) of the conterminous United States include rural roads in the developed land class and therefore overestimate the amount of urban land. To better map the urban class and understand how urban lands change over time, we removed rural roads and small patches of rural development from theNLCDdeveloped class and created four wall-to-wall maps (1992, 2001, 2006, and 2011) of urban land. Removing rural roads from theNLCDdeveloped class involved a multi-step filtering process, data fusion using geospatial road and developed land data, and manual editing. Reference data classified as urban or not urban from a stratified random sample was used to assess the accuracy of the 2001 and 2006 urban andNLCDmaps. The newly created urban maps had higher overall accuracy (98.7 percent) than theNLCDmaps (96.2 percent). More importantly, the urban maps resulted in lower commission error of the urban class (23 percent versus 57 percent for theNLCDin 2006) with the trade-off of slightly inflated omission error (20 percent for the urban map, 16 percent forNLCDin 2006). The removal of approximately 230,000 km2of rural roads from theNLCDdeveloped class resulted in maps that better characterize the urban footprint. These urban maps are more suited to modeling applications and policy decisions that rely on quantitative and spatially explicit information regarding urban lands.
