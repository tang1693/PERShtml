                The low-cost Multispectral Airborne Video System (MAVS), developed using off-the-shelf components, is predominantly being used for agricultural and environmental monitoring applications in Australia. In order to guarantee quality of operational imagery, regular radiometric calibration checks, under both preflight and in-flight environments, are a necessity. While preflight calibration is conducted in the field with relative ease, to conduct in-flight calibration checks during operational missions is difficult, especially when onboard calibration instrumentation is not available. The calibration of MAVS imagery in flight requires a radiative transfer code such as the 6S to simulate the radiation signal at the operational altitude. A comparison of the simulated in-flight calibration equation with the corresponding preflight calibration equation showed a statistically significant agreement for every MAVS band, demonstrating the stability of response of the instrument in the air. This MAVS response stability indicates a potential for calibrating operational airborne imagery using preflight calibration equations. A few simulated in-flight calibration checks, in addition to regular preflight calibrations, could still be carried out during the flight season to verify system radiometric response in the air.

                Radiometric effects hamper the use of airborne remote sensing data for quantitative studies of biophysical environments. The effect of bidirectional reflectance is evaluated in four areal samples from three lakes in the Vuoksi drainage basin in Finland. It is shown statistically that the relationship between measured upwelling radiation and the sun-target-sensor geometry is weak for an aquatic macrophyte species, the common reed(Phragmites australis),but strong for birch (Betula pubes-cens) and mixed birch-spruce(Picea abies)forest. The density and phenotype of the common reed vegetation seem to have an effect on the strength of the bidirectional reflectance in the images. When the effect of bidirectional reflectance over common reed vegetation is statistically significant, an empirical normalization method can be used, after which the brightness of the test areas is no longer statistically dependent on the sun-target-sensor geometry.

                The main study objective was to develop robust processing and analysis techniques to facilitate the use of small-footprint lidar data for estimating plot-level tree height by measuring individual trees identifiable on the three-dimensional lidar surface. Lidar processing techniques included data fusion with multispectral optical data and local filtering with both square and circular windows of variable size. The lidar system used for this study produced an average footprint of 0.65 m and an average distance between laser shots of 0.7 m. The lidar data set was acquired over deciduous and coniferous stands with settings typical of the southeastern United States. The lidar-derived tree measurements were used with regression models and cross-validation to estimate tree height on 0.017-ha plots. For the pine plots, lidar measurements explained 97 percent of the variance associated with the mean height of dominant trees. For deciduous plots, regression models explained 79 percent of the mean height variance for dominant trees. Filtering for local maximum with circular windows gave better fitting models for pines, while for deciduous trees, filtering with square windows provided a slightly better model fit. Using lidar and optical data fusion to differentiate between forest types provided better results for estimating average plot height for pines. Estimating tree height for deciduous plots gave superior results without calibrating the search window size based on forest type.

                A complete, high-resolution coastline of Antarctica, extracted from an orthorectified mosaic of Radarsat-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images through a sequence of automated image processing algorithms, is presented. A locally adaptive thresholding method is used to segment the orthorectified SAR images, while image-object formation and labeling, and edge-tracing techniques are used to process the segmented images into vector-based cartographic products of coastline, defined here as the boundary between continental ice or rock exposures and sea ice covered ocean. The absolute accuracy of planimetric positioning of the resultant coastline is estimated to better than 130 m, and its spatial resolution (25 m) is adequate for supporting cartographic and scientific applications at 1:50,000 scale. This radar-image-derived coastline gives an accurate description of geometric shape and glaciological characteristics of the Antarctic coasts and also provides a precise benchmark for future change-detection studies.

                A methodology for landslide susceptibility mapping using an integrated remote sensing and GIS approach is presented. A part of the Darjeeling Himalaya was selected for the model execution. IRS satellite data, topographic maps, field data, and other informative maps were used as inputs to the study. Important terrain factors, contributing to landslide occurrences in the region, were identified and corresponding thematic data layers were generated. These data layers represent the geological, topographical, and hydrological conditions of the terrain. A numerical rating scheme for the factors was developed for spatial data analysis in a GIS. The resulting landslide susceptibility map delineates the area into different zones of four relative susceptibility classes: high, moderate, low, and very low. The susceptibility map was validated by correlating the landslide frequencies of different classes. This has shown a close agreement with the existing field instability condition. The effectiveness of the map was also confirmed by the high statistically significant value of a chi-square test.

                The accuracy of thematic maps derived by image classification analyses is often compared in remote sensing studies. This comparison is typically achieved by a basic subjective assessment of the observed difference in accuracy but should be undertaken in a statistically rigorous fashion. One approach for the evaluation of the statistical significance of a difference in map accuracy that has been widely used in remote sensing research is based on the comparison of the kappa coefficient of agreement derived for each map. The conventional approach to the comparison of kappa coefficients assumes that the samples used in their calculation are independent, an assumption that is commonly unsatisfied because the same sample of ground data sites is often used for each map. Alternative methods to evaluate the statistical significance of differences in accuracy are available for both related and independent samples. Approaches for map comparison based on the kappa coefficient and proportion of correctly allocated cases, the two most widely used metrics of thematic map accuracy in remote sensing, are discussed. An example illustrates how classifications based on the same sample of ground data sites may be compared rigorously and highlights the importance of distinguishing between one- and two-sided statistical tests in the comparison of classification accuracy statements.

                A prototyping effort pertaining to the design and development of a raster image re-projection web service is summarized. The goal of the effort is to identify the complexities of interoperable service design and the feasibility of service chaining in a GIS Web Services architecture. A description of a preliminary web interface and the implementation options considered for the prototype are described. The experience of chaining this service with the Open GIS Consortium (OGC) Web Mapping Services is also summarized. In the process, the difficulties arising from the lack of standards in the areas of projection systems representation and georectified raster imagery encodings are highlighted. The limitations of legacy GIS systems in accommodating the requirements of a generic re-projection service are also discussed. Lessons learned about basic requirements for efficient service chaining are presented in the areas of performance and reliability of services, ease of access to services and their capabilities, and the need for simple solutions.
