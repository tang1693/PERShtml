                We devised a semiautomatic approach for extracting lake features based on a customized set of normalized difference water index (NDWI) information which was obtained by incorporating high resolution, 8-band WorldView-2 data. An extensive accuracy assessment was carried out for three semiautomatic feature extraction approaches for extracting 36 lake features on Larsemann Hills, Antarctica. The method was tested on five existing PAN-sharpening algorithms, which suggest that the customized NDWI approach renders intermediate performance (root mean square error varies from ε227 to ε235 m2) and highest stability when compared with existing feature extraction techniques. In general, the customized NDWI rendered a least misclassification (≈11 percent), followed by target detection (≈16 percent) and spectral processing (≈17 percent) methods for extraction of 36 lakes. We also found that customized NDWI caused consistently least misclassification (≈21 percent) than the target detection (≈23 percent) and spectral processing (≈30 percent) methods for extraction of partially snow or ice-covered 11 lakes. Our results indicate that the use of the customized NDWI approach and appropriate PAN-sharpening algorithm can greatly improve the semiautomatic extraction of lake features in cryospheric environment.

                Airborne Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) data provide useful measurements of forest canopy structure but are often limited in spatial coverage. Satellite remote sensing data from Landsat can provide extensive spatial coverage of generalized forest information. A forest survey approach that integrates airborne lidar and satellite data would potentially capitalize upon these distinctive characteristics. In this study in coastal forests of British Columbia, the main objective was to determine the potential of Landsat imagery to accurately estimate forest canopy cover measured from small-footprint airborne lidar data in order to expand the lidar measurements to a larger area. Landsat-derived Tasseled Cap Angle (TCA) and spectral mixture analysis (SMA) endmember fractions (i.e., sunlit canopy, non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), shade and exposed soil) were compared to lidar-derived canopy cover estimates. Pixel-based analysis and object-based area-weighted error calculations were used to assess regression model performance. The best canopy cover estimate was obtained (in the object-based deciduous forest models) with a mean object size (MOS) of 2.5 hectares (adjusted R2= 0.86 and RMSE = 0.28). Overall, lower canopy cover estimation accuracy was obtained for coniferous forests compared to deciduous forests in both the pixel and object-based approaches.

                An effective approach to spectral-spatial classification has been achieved using Hierarchical SEGmentation (HSEG) by Tarabalka et al. (2009 and 2010). Our goal is to improve this approach to the classification of hyperspectral images in urban areas. The first step of our proposed method is to segment the spectral images using a novel marker-based HSEG method. The spatial features from segmented images are then extracted. Spatial information such as the area, entropy, shape, adjacency, and relation features constitute the components of feature space. Last, using both spectral and spatial features, the image objects are classified by a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Three image datasets were used to test this method. The results of our experiment indicate that the main advantage of the proposed method, compared to the previous HSEG-based approach, is that it increases classification accuracy by selecting the appropriate contextual features of different objects.

                Satellite-based remote sensing technique provides images to detect and monitor forest fire smoke. Aiming at automatically separating smoke plumes from other cover types, several bands of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra/Aqua satellites were selected. A smoke identification algorithm that integrates K-means clustering and Fisher Linear Discrimination was developed. It’s evaluated that the algorithm can identify more than 98 percent of the smoke pixels by using the k-folds cross-validation technique. Then, the algorithm was validated in: (a) Daxing'anling area (China) on 29 April 2009, (b) Amur Region (Russia) on 29 April 2009, (c) Australia on 30 September 2011, and (d) Canada on 19 June 2013, in which several fires occurred. By comparing the results with the grayscale images, it can be seen that the algorithm has the capability to capture heavy smoke as well as part of dispersed smoke. The results suggest that the proposed algorithm can be used as an innovative tool for detecting forest fire smoke.

                This study evaluated the effectiveness of different band combinations and classifiers (unsupervised, supervised, object-oriented nearest neighbor, and object-oriented decision rule) for quantifying mangrove forest change using multitemporal Landsat data. A discriminant analysis using spectra of different vegetation types determined that bands 2 (0.52 to 0.6 μm), 5 (1.55 to 1.75 μm), and 7 (2.08 to 2.35 μm) were the most effective bands for differentiating mangrove forests from surrounding land cover types. A ranking of thirty-six change maps, produced by comparing the classification accuracy of twelve change detection approaches, was used. The object-based Nearest Neighbor classifier produced the highest mean overall accuracy (84 percent) regardless of band combinations. The automated decision rule-based approach (mean overall accuracy of 88 percent) as well as a composite of bands 2, 5, and 7 used with the unsupervised classifier and the same composite or all band difference with the object-oriented Nearest Neighbor classifier were the most effective approaches.
