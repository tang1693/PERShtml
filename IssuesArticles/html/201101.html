                The support vector machine is a group of relatively novel statistical learning algorithms that have not been extensively exploited in the remote sensing community. In previous studies they have been found to generally outperform some popular classifiers. Several recent studies found that training samples and input data dimensionalities can affect image classification accuracies by those popular classifiers and support vector machines alike. The current study extends beyond these recent research frameworks and into another important inquiry area addressing the impacts of internal parameterization on the performance of support vector machines for land-cover classification. A set of support vector machines with different combinations of kernel types, parameters, and error penalty are carefully constructed to classify a Landsat Thematic Mapper image into eight major land-cover categories using identical training data. The accuracy of each classified map is further evaluated using identical reference data. The results reveal that kernel types and error penalty can substantially affect the classification accuracy, and that a careful selection of parameter settings can help improve the performance of the support vector classification. These findings reported here can help establish a practical guidance on the use of support vector machines for land-cover classification from remote sensor data.

                An empirical model was developed to produce a spatially-explicit classification error probability surface for a map of land-cover change resulting from post-classification change analysis. The role of contextual information in predicting change classification error was assessed by testing the significance of variables identifying the absence or presence of classification error in the time-series maps and variables describing landscape composition and structure. A generalized additive model relating errors in classifying change to the series of predictor variables successfully explained over 90 percent of model residual deviance. Predictors capturing the location of classification error in the time-series were the primary determinants of change classification error. However, several predictors describing landscape characteristics were included in the final model. Their inclusion resulted in a sharper delineation between low- and high-error probability regions and a better understanding of the nature of change classification error.

                We compared global-scale pansharpening of full- or large-scene QuickBird satellite imagery with local-scale pansharpening of a subset of these scenes by using modified intensity-hue-saturation (MIHS), principal component analysis (PCA), multiplicative (MP), and high pass filter (HPF) methods. The spectral properties of all pansharpened images were evaluated by using quantitative indices such as erreur relative globale adimensionnelle de synth√®se (ERGAS), correlation coefficient (CC), relative difference to mean (RDM), and relative difference to standard deviation (RDS). This study discovered that local-scale pansharpening was generally lower and higher than the global-scale approach in terms of ERGAS and CC, respectively. In particular, local-scale HPF produced pansharpening results very close to the original multispectral image with less than 0.18 percent and 0.07 percent of RDM and RDS, respectively. Local-scale fusion results with PCA and MP were similar to those of the global-scale approach. Local-scale pansharpening that uses very high spatial resolution imagery could lead to the rapid assessment of the magnitude and severity of humanitarian situations by producing a color image of high spatial resolution with reduced processing time.

            Remote Sensing Classification Using Fractal Dimensions over a Subtropical Hilly Region

                Subtropical hilly regions in China have various and complex surface features, which are difficult to identify in remote-sensing images. A new algorithm for calculating the fractal dimension of a single pixel of a remote-sensing image is presented. The fractal dimension data for a scene captured in an ETM+(i.e., Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) image were used to compose a new image together with the second and fourth bands of the ETM+image. Using the new image, the land-use/land-cover types and forest categories in the region were identified using a maximum likelihood classification. The accuracy assessment of the classification gave an overall accuracy of 80.69 percent and a Khatvalue of 0.78. The proposed method is a little more accurate than the method that does not use fractal dimension data, especially for identification of different types of vegetation in the region.

                An attempt to delineate impervious surfaces in the City of Scottsbluff, Nebraska, was made using multispectral high spatial resolution imagery and lidar data. An ISODATA classification was performed and results aggregated into two parent classes, impervious and pervious. The ISODATA classification yielded an overall accuracy of 91.0 percent with a Kappa of 82.0 percent. A Knowledge Based Expert System (KBES) set of rules was designed incorporating the imagery classification with lidar data to derive two models, Cover Height and Cover Slope, to provide critical information not available from multispectral imagery. The rules were applied to the initial ISODATA classification to improve the classification accuracy to an overall accuracy of 94.0 percent with a Kappa of 87.9 percent. In this study, it was shown that lidar holds promise for improving the accuracy of impervious surface measurement, as well as the potential identification and measurement of other significant planimetric features such as buildings and trees.

            Precise Georefrencing of Long Strips of ALOS Imagery

                The main obstacle to achieving high precision in georeferencing from high-resolution satellite imagery (HRSI) remains the need for provision of good quality ground control points (GCPs), whether the GCPs are used to remove biases in RPC triangulation or to support physical sensor orientation models. The provision of GCPs can be very costly and is often not feasible in remote regions, the very areas where mapping from satellite imagery shows significant potential. In order to drastically reduce the number of GCPs required for georeferencing from HRSI, a generic sensor orientation model incorporating strip adjustment capability has been adopted. Under this approach, the metadata for each separate scene is merged to produce a single, continuous set of orbit and attitude parameters, such that the entire strip of tens of images can be treated as a single image. The merging of orbit data results in a considerable reduction in both the number of unknown parameters and the number of required GCPs in the sensor orientation. RPCs are then generated from the adjusted orientation data for each image forming the strip or block. Application of the method to very long strips of ALOS PRSIM imagery is reported in this paper. The results of experimental testing indicate that one-pixel level accuracy can be achieved over strip lengths of more than 50 ALOS images, or 1,500 km, with as few as four GCPs.
