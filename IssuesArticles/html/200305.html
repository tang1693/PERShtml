                With the development of remote sensing technology, fusion of remotely sensed images, such as SPOT panchromatic (SPOT P) with SPOT multispectral images (SPOT XS) or Land-sat Thematic Mapper (TM), has become more important in order to obtain richer information in the spatial and spectral domains simultaneously. Many fusion methods have been developed based on the two-band wavelet transformation. However, due to the limitations of the transformation characteristics themselves, the two-band wavelet is not very efficient for the fusion of images whose ratio of spatial resolutions is not 2n(n=1, 2, 3,...), e.g., for fusing a 10-m resolution panchromatic SPOT image and with 30-m resolution multispectral TM images. However, a recently developed new wavelet branch—multi-band wavelet—can potentially be applied to solve this problem.In this paper, we develop a new approach for fusing SPOT P images with multispectral TM images based on multi-band wavelet transformation. First, the theoretical basis of multi-band wavelet is presented and its transformation properties are analyzed. Second, a new method for fusing a SPOT P image with multispectral images using the multi-band wavelet is proposed. Specifically, the three-band wavelet is implemented to fuse 10-m SPOT panchromatic and 30-m multispectral TM images. Third, this new method is compared with previous methods such as the two-band wavelet and IHS methods for image fusion. The proposed multi-band wavelet approach demonstrates an improvement in spatial and spectral characteristics for fusing SPOT P and multispectral TM images.

                Accurate corrections of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for atmospheric effects are currently based on modeling the physical behavior of radiation as it passes through the atmosphere. An important requirement for application of the physical models is detailed information on atmospheric humidity and particles. Here, a method is described for making atmospheric corrections without the need for detailed atmospheric observations. A simplified procedure for making atmospheric corrections to reflectances observed from satellites is developed by using the unique spectral signature of water pixels in satellite images. A radiative transfer model is applied to a variety of clear-sky conditions to generate functional relationships between the radiation due to the atmospheric scattering above water bodies and atmospheric radiative properties. Test cases indicate that the resulting estimates of surface reflectances and NDVI agree well with estimates made using a radiative transfer model applied independently and with measurements made at the surface.

            Comparison of Gray-Level Reduction and Different Texture Spectrum Encoding Methods for Land-Use Classification Using a Panchromatic Ikonos Image

                In this paper, we evaluate the potential of a frequency-based contextual classifier (FBC) for land-use classification with a panchromatic Ikonos image. To capture the spatial arrangement of image gray-level values and use such information in image classification, we applied texture spectrum (TS) directly in the FBC. The effects of several data preprocessing and reduction methods on the performance of the FBC are also evaluated. The methods include four gray-level reduction (GLR) techniques and several modifications to the TS technique. The purpose of data reduction is to improve the classification efficiency of the FBC. The GLR schemes were min-max linear compression (LC), gray level binning (BN), histogram equalization (HE), and piece-wise nonlinear compression (PC). Instead of using the texture measures derived from the texture spectrum, we directly applied texture spectra of various sizes in the classification. We modified the encoding algorithm in the TS and were able to reduce the number of texture units from its original 6561 to 256, 81, and 16, leading to as much as a 410 times computation efficiency. The original image and GLR images were subsequently classified with the FBC. We compared the classification accuracies and found that the GLR methods resulted in accuracies similar to that of the original image (within 0.03 kappa value). There was little difference in classification accuracy (within 0.03 kappa value) among the three modified TS methods, which were all outperformed by the original TS method. All TS methods performed considerably better than the use of the original image and the GLR methods.

                There is a global concern about the increase in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. One method being discussed to encourage greenhouse gas mitigation efforts is based on a trading system whereby carbon emitters can buy effective mitigation efforts from farmers implementing conservation tillage practices. These practices sequester carbon from the atmosphere, and such a trading system would require a low-cost and accurate method of verification. Remote sensing technology can offer such a verification technique. This paper is focused on the use of standard image processing procedures applied to a multispectral Ikonos image, to determine whether it is possible to validate that farmers have complied with agreements to implement conservation tillage practices. A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed in order to isolate image variance in cropped fields. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) statistical procedures were used to evaluate the capability of each Ikonos band and each principal component to discriminate between conventional and conservation tillage practices. A logistic regression model was implemented on the principal component most effective in discriminating between conventional and conservation tillage, in order to produce a map of the probability of conventional tillage. The Ikonos imagery, in combination with ground-reference information, proved to be a useful tool for verification of conservation tillage practices.

            Building and Evaluating Models to Estimate Ambient Population Density

                The concept of human population density is quite simple: the number of persons occupying a given area. Nonetheless, practical representations of population density must use appropriate spatial and temporal scales of measurement to be useful. The 11 September 2001 attack on the World Trade Center in New York is a poignant example: “How many people were in the two World Trade Center buildings at 0830 local time?” Population density data derived from most-national censuses is a residential measure of population density and consequently does not capture non-residential population density. Human mobility suggests that a nonresidential or ambient measure of population density may be a more useful representation for some applications. Ambient population density in this sense is a temporally averaged measure of population density that takes into account where people work, sleep, eat, drive, shop, etc. Short of implanting a GPS reciever into everyone’s skull and tracking their spatio-temporal behavior, it is extremely difficult to make direct measurements of ambient population density. This paper explores some theoretical and empirical efforts at estimating ambient population density and proposes a quantitative means for evaluating their validity. The three models of population density examined are LandScan, Gridded Population of the World (GPW), and a simple empirical model derived from nighttime satellite imagery provided by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program’s Operational Linescan System (DMSP OLS). These measures are compared to both residential and employment-based measures of population density in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The GPW, LandScan, and DMSP OLS models of ambient population density described here all make foundational contributions to future efforts at filling the gap in social, economic, and demographic information for parts of the world where such data are unavailable. The proxy measures of population density described here show promise for many applications, including improved mapping of population distribution and as a supplement to census enumerations in many parts of the world.

                Surface radiant temperatures derived from Landsat TM thermal infrared images of 13 December, 1989, 03 March, 1996, and 29 August 1997 were used to study the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon in Guangzhou, China. To examine the spatial distribution of surface radiant temperatures, transects were drawn and analyzed from each temperature image. Moreover, the fractal dimensions of these transects were computed using the divider method, so that the spatial variability of surface radiant temperatures caused by the thermal behavior of different land-cover types and landscape pattern characteristics can be better understood. The effect of urban development on the geographical distribution of surface radiant temperatures and thus on the UHI was also investigated. The results revealed two major heat islands, one in the southwest and the other in the east of the city. The areal extent of the UHIs varied as the season changed. The transact derived from the spring image had the lowest fractal dimension while that from the summer image the highest value. Urban development increased the spatial variability of radiant temperatures, resulting in higher fractal dimension values. The thermal surfaces have become more spatially uneven and the textures more complex.

            Image Calibration to Like-Values in Mapping Shallow Water Quality from Multitemporal Data

                The applicability of image calibration to like-values in mapping water quality parameters from multitemporal images is explored. Six sets of water samples were collected at satellite overpasses over Moreton Bay, Brisbane, Australia. Analysis of these samples reveals that waters in this shallow bay are mostly TSS-dominated, even though they are occasionally dominated by chlorophyll as well. Three of the images were calibrated to a reference image based on invariant targets. Predictive models constructed from the reference image were applied to estimating total suspended sediment (TSS) and Secchi depth from another image at a discrepancy of around 35 percent. Application of the predictive model for TSS concentration to another image acquired at a time of different water types resulted in a discrepancy of 152 percent. Therefore, image calibration to like-values could be used to reliably map certain water quality parameters from multitemporal TM images so long as the water type under study remains unchanged. This method is limited in that the mapped results could be rather inaccurate if the water type under study has changed considerably. Thus, the approach needs to be refined in shallow water from multitemporal satellite imagery.
