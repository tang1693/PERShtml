                It is well-known that interferometric SAR (INSAR) is a technology for the generation of high-precision digital elevation models (DEM) and the precise measurement of terrain surface deformation. The accuracy of DEM and deformation measurement is highly dependent on the quality of the interferogram generated. Such an interferogram is constructed by a point-wise complex multiplication of corresponding pixels in both datasets, which are respectively contained in master image and registered image.An exanimation of existing literature reveals that there is no, good, quantitative measure for the quality of interfero-grams, and visual inspection is still the best solutions available so far. By visual inspection, one recognizes those interfer-ograms with continuous fringes as good ones and regards those with many discontinuous interferograms and speckles as being not good. As the pixels in the interferogram represent the phase value values, it is natural to think that, if the quality is good, the phase differences between neighbor pixels should be small, and thus the sum of all phase differences will still be small. This leads to the proposal of “sum of phase differences” (SPD) as a quantitative measure for the quality of interferogram. Two simulation tests have been conducted, and the results show that the SPD is a reliable measure.

                Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (INSAR) allows for production of high resolution DEM and detection of small earth deformation using multiple-pass SAR data sets. The automatic algorithm for registration of the INSAR data is one of the key points for improving both accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, an automatic approach based on multi-step matching strategy is presented and only intensity components of SLC images are involved in relevant computation. Both probability relaxation and Least-Square Matching (LSM) algorithms have been introduced to maintain reliability and improve accuracy. All the procedures could be automatically implemented. Primary results are promising and reveal the potential for operational INSAR data processing.

                The Grove Mountains Area is situated to the southwest of Princess Elizabeth Land, the inland areas of east Antarctica. Adopting Landsat-4 TM images, a coloured satellite image map of Grove Mountains was produced and used to design an expedition route to Grove Mountains in 1998. In 2000, a field survey of the core area was completed with GPS and total station surveys. However, traditional mapping methods are no longer the most efficient means of obtaining topographic maps or DEM in large areas, especially those areas that are more inaccessible. Synthetic aperture radar interferometry has been proposed as a potential technique for digital elevation model (DEM) generation, topographic mapping, and surface motion detection. This paper presents an experimental investigation of the ERS-1/2 SAR tandem data on DEM generation of the Grove Mountains Core Area, and compares the DEM derived by INSAR with the DEM generated using field survey data. The paper confirms that INSAR is a very valuable technique to be utilized in Antarctica, and that INSAR can be employed to produce complementary field survey products.

                Ground settlement has long been a problem in Hong Kong, as most usable land in Hong Kong was reclaimed from the sea. Ground settlement may affect building structures and underground facilities such as water supply and sewage systems built on the land. Measurements of ground settlement can provide valuable data for assessing the impacts of ground settlement and for improving designs of future land reclamation projects.Experiments have been carried out to assess the performance of INSAR in the environment of Hong Kong especially the temporal decorrelations of SAR images and the potential atmospheric effects on INSAR measurements, and to use INSAR to study the ground settlement problem in Hong Kong. This study finds that the temporal decorrelation is an important problem in the heavily vegetated rugged areas as usually expected, and that the atmospheric effects can be very significant at times. Ground settlements measured over the airport and a residential area are presented. It can be seen from the results that both of the areas are still settling significantly many years after the reclamation.

                This paper applies SAR Interferometry for ground deformation in two cases: the 1998 Zhangbei-Shangyi Earthquake in Northern China and the urban subsidence in Suzhou City from 1993 to 2000. It is concluded that SAR interferometry may provide valuable information for understanding the spatial patterns and progress of natural hazards. SAR interferometry is also critical for mechanism studies and hazard mitigation.

                The differential INSAR technique has the potential for monitoring centimeter-scale ground motion in an accurate and cost-effective manner. Probably the most important limiting factor in the application of INSAR is temporal change in the complex reflectivity of the ground surface during the period between radar acquisitions. This can be due to changes in such parameters as moisture content or vegetation. The stable artificial corner reflectors can be identified from long temporal series of interferometric SAR images even with large baselines, and therefore decrease the risk of image decorrelation. This paper will discuss the following questions: 1) how to obtain the true phase of a corner reflector in a SAR complex image; 2) how to co-register the corner reflector pixels when the coherence of its surrounding area is extremely low; 3) how to select the interpolation kernel to resample the SAR image; and, 4) how to compute the interferometric phase of two co-registered corner reflectors without flat earth term and corners’ height contribution. In order to demonstrate the results, a practical example of landslide monitoring in the Three Gorges area in China is presented.

                Error in radar satellite orbit determination is a common problem in radar interferometry (INSAR). For example, when we try to locate a radar test site with known geographic coordinates using the geocoding information in SLC (the latitude and longitude of the four image corners), the location is well away from the true position. Another example is when there is a signifi-cant disturbance in the differential INSAR result, we sometimes are not sure whether it is from ground deformation or atmospheric heterogeneity. Even after these are corrected, we need to export the INSAR results to a GIS format so that they can be overlaid as layers over orthophotos and mine plans (in the case of mining subsidence) in order to interpret the results. Therefore, it is proposed to use both GPS and GIS to assist radar interferometry. Results are presented with an application to monitoring subsidence due to underground mining southwest of Sydney, Australia.

            Detection of Rapid Erosion in SE Spain

                This paper presents an integrated remote sensing—GIS approach for identifying areas vulnerable to rapid erosion in Almería Province, Southeast Spain. Earth Resources Satellite (ERS) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) multi-temporal interferometric coherence imagery has been used to detect rapid erosion that causes random changes in the micro-topography of a land surface. These small scale changes result in reduced coherence of the radar signals between the initial and eroded states. However, the detection solely based on coherence imagery is not exclusive because other factors may cause losing coherence as well. A Geographic Information System (GIS) is then used to derive criteria for a set of environmental conditions favourable to rapid erosion from multi-datasets including Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) imagery and geological maps. The areas predicted to be most vulnerable to rapid erosion across the imagery are then identified where hard evidence of low coherence coincides with favourable conditions.
