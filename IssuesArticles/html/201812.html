                The PM2.5 (particulate matters with aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5μm) distribution with large scale and high resolution is required for the protection of atmospheric environment and epidemiology studies. In this study, an improved geographically and temporally weighted regression (IGTWR) model incorporating seasonal characteristics is proposed to estimate the PM2.5 concentrations over Hong Kong. The IGTWR model is established using MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) derived by SARA (simplified aerosol retrieval algorithm), meteorological data and land use data. A comparison among ordinary least squares (OLS), geographically weighted regression (GWR), geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) and the proposed IGTWR indicate that the IGTWR model has the best prediction performance for PM2.5 concentrations with highest R2 (0.752) and smallest RMSE (9.651μg/m3). The annual mean PM2.5 distribution at 500 m resolution over Hong Kong from 2012 to 2014 is derived using IGTWR, demonstrating its potential of satellite-based PM2.5 monitoring.

                We propose an inspiring approach for accurate impervious surface estimation based on the integration of remote sensing and social data. The proposed approach exploits the strengths of two kind of heterogeneous features, i.e., physical features and social features, where the former ones are derived by a morphological attribute profiles-guided spectral mixture analysis model using remote sensing imagery, and the latter ones are obtained from the normalized kernel density of point of interest and vector road datasets. These two features are then integrated using a multivariable linear regression model to estimate impervious surfaces. The proposed method has been tested in the main urban area of Guangzhou, China, in pixel level and parcel level, respectively. The obtained results, with the overall RMSE of 10.98% and 10.90% for pixel level and parcel level, respectively, demonstrate the good performance of integrating remote sensing imagery and social data for mapping of urban impervious surface.

                Most of the studies employing ground-based hyperspectral cameras have been restricted to either visible-near infrared (VNIR) or shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectrum. In this study, continuous VNIR+SWIR image spectra were obtained from two separate hyperspectral cameras. Spatial co-registration of panoramic hyperspectral images was performed using homologous points automatically extracted by the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm. The effect of input image selection on identifying homologous points and different transformation techniques on image co-registration were evaluated. Although proper spatial image co-registration was expected to provide persistent spectral data, spectral concatenation of the hyperspectral images required characterizing and correcting the errors and inconsistencies due to camera sensor properties and limitations. Bringing spectral data from two hyperspectral cameras together provided the opportunity to identify and differentiate lithological units, which would not have been possible using a single sensor, and thus allow more detailed and extended spectral analysis of near-vertical outcrops.

                Bias compensation has been the most widely used sensor orientation method for high-resolution satellite images (HRSIs). However, the theoretical precision of affine compensation and drift compensation is still unclear. In this research, a stereo pair-based block adjustment model for HRSIs is developed, in which the block adjustment can be simplified to orientation in steps. The impact of the number and arrangement of tie points on precision is described, and it is proved that when affine compensation is applied, the cofactors grow exponentially with the number of strips. After eliminating the samplerelated compensated parameters, the theoretical precision of the drift compensation model becomes independent of lateral overlap. With four strips of ZY3 images, the experiment shows that the drift compensation model can achieve homogeneous accuracy with four ground control points at the corners of the entire block; nevertheless, the geolocation errors of an affine compensation model differ from strip to strip.

                The relative chlorophyll content is one of the essential factors that affect crop growth and yield, and chlorophyll is an important parameter that reflects the stress and health of vegetation. The spectral feature parameter method is widely applied to estimate the relative chlorophyll content of wheat. To provide a scientific basis for wheat growth monitoring and agronomic decision-making, we estimated the relative chlorophyll content using hyperspectral technology. During the summer of 2017, we collected canopy reflectance spectra using field spectroscopy along with the relative chlorophyll content of wheat. To comprehensively analyze the field-collected hyperspectral data, various band combinations were used to calculate a simple spectral index (ratio spectral index, RSI), normalized difference spectral index (NDSI) and chlorophyll index (CI). We compared simple spectral indices with 17 different indices from the literature. The relationships between the indices and relative chlorophyll content were then examined, and the strongest relationships were demonstrated. The partial least squares regression (PLSR) method was utilized to develop a predictive model of the relative chlorophyll content. The newly identified NDSIs, RSIs, and CIs always performed better than the spectral indices from previous studies, and the relative chlorophyll content exhibited the highest correlations with RSI (R849 nm, R850 nm), CI (R849 nm, R850 nm), and NDSI (R849 nm, R850 nm), calculated using leaf reflectance spectra (|r| ≥ 0.7). The -model revealed that the highest R2Pre (0.74) and lowest RMSEPre (2.72 SPAD) were identified with four optimized chlorophyll indices (CI (R849 nm, R850 nm), CI (R539 nm, R553 nm), CI (R540 nm, R553 nm), and CI (R536 nm, R553 nm)). The spatial information from these parameters will aid the proper nutrient management of optimal spring wheat crop growth and forecasting models for a precision wheat agriculture system.
