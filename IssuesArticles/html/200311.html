                Neural networks, recently applied to a number of image classification problems, are computational systems consisting of neurons or nodes arranged in layers with interconnecting links. Although there are a wide range of network types and possible applications in remote sensing, most attention has focused on the use of MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) or FeedForward (FF) networks trained with a backpropagation-learning algorithm for supervised classification. One of the main characteristic elements of an artificial neural network (ANN) is the activation function. Nonlinear logistic (sigmoid and tangent hyperbolic) and linear activation functions have been used effectively with MLP networks for various purposes. The main objective of this study is to compare sigmoid, tangent hyperbolic, and linear activation functions through the one- and two-hidden layered MLP neural network structures trained with the scaled conjugate gradient learning algorithm, and to evaluate their performance on the multispectral Landsat TM imagery classification problem.

                The accuracy of lidar systems and the removal of systematic errors have received growing attention in recent years. The level of accuracy and the additional processing that is needed for making the raw data ready to use are affected directly by the systematic errors in the laser data. It is evident that calibration of the lidar system, both laboratory and in-flight, are mandatory to alleviate these deficiencies. This paper presents an error recovery model that is based on modeling the system errors and on defining adequate control information. The association of the observations and control information, and configurations that enhance the reliability of the recovered parameters, are also studied here in detail. The application of the model is demonstrated on two of the main error sources in the system, the mounting and the range bias.

                Because tropical grasslands play an important role in the storage of global carbon, monitoring them is critical to evaluating global climate change. The goal of this research is to model seasonal SeaWinds Ku-band backscatter in five savanna areas of Colombia, Venezuela, and Brazil as a function of biophysical changes in the savanna landscape. Multiple regression modeling demonstrates that savanna Ku-band backscatter is a function of (1) savanna grass biomass/leaf area, (2) soil moisture, and (3) other soil characteristics. Fit for the regression models is excellent (R = 0.87 and 0.81, respectively, for the horizontal and vertical polarization case). The horizontal–vertical polarization difference is also moderately related to precipitation (R = 0.71). The results from this modeling are consistent with theory predicated on previous C- and X-band research. The possibility of monitoring savanna vegetation, soil moisture, and rainfall using Ku-band radar and scatterometry is discussed.

                Grassland management practices influence many bio- and geophysical processes. The ability to discriminate among different land-use practices is critical to an improved understanding of agro-ecosystem dynamics in the tallgrass prairies of the Central Great Plains. The overall objective of this study was to assess the spectral separability of three land-use practices on warm-season (C4 dominated) and cool-season (C3 dominated) grasslands using data obtained from multitemporal Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery. Results showed that cool- and warm-season grasslands could be discriminated with a high level of accuracy (91.5 percent). When grasslands were categorized by three common management practices (Conservation Reserve Program [CRP], grazing and haying), they could be discriminated with a moderately high level of accuracy (70.4 percent). Grassland management practices within warm- and cool-season grasslands (six types) were spectrally discriminated with a moderate level of accuracy (67.6 percent overall). The use of a three-date Landsat TM image dataset spanning the spring-summer-fall seasons significantly improved classification accuracy over the use of a single-date TM approach.

                The spatial arrangement of the brightness values of remotely sensed imagery bears important information for forest canopy structures. This paper presents the theory and a simple analytical model to estimate tree crown size using sills of semivariograms from images at two spatial resolutions. The theoretical basis for the model is that the spatial patterns of multiresolution imagery are diagnostic of tree size. The sills of variograms from images containing larger trees decrease more slowly than those for images containing smaller trees as the image spatial resolution decreases. Tests with generated images, integrated simulation of stand development and its spatial patterns, and Ikonos images show that the model can provide realistic estimates of tree crown size. Errors of the estimated crown size strongly depend on the spatial resolutions of the images. The best combination of spatial resolutions is at the ratio of pixel size to the object size around unity.

            Evaluating the Performance of Spatially Explicit Models

                Spatially explicit models are now widely used for conducting ecological research and for managing natural resources, due in part to the difficulty of undertaking empirical work at landscape scale. Unfortunately, error assessment and analysis of the predictive ability of such models is not well-developed, and has relied on the Kappa statistic and information-based measures. As has been pointed out, however, such approaches are limited by virtue of their global nature and weak hypotheses. As it turns out, the literature on map accuracy does provide a way of assessing model performance, and the goal of this paper is to adapt this literature to the need for evaluating the predictive ability of spatially explicit models. To this end, the paper first considers inference using the Kappa statistic. This is followed by a commentary on information theory, and a critique of both the Kappa statistic and information-based approaches given their global structure and underlying null hypotheses. A probabilistic treatment of alternative measures recently suggested follows, as does a direct adaptation of map inference to the modeling case. Examples of the proposed measures are given, using an application of logistic regression applied to land-cover changes that have recently occurred in the Muskegon River watershed of the State of Michigan.

                With the development of new remote sensing systems, veryhigh spatial and spectral resolution images now provide a source for detailed and continuous sampling of the Earth’s surface from local to regional scales. This paper presents three strategies for selecting and integrating information from different spatial resolutions into classification routines. One strategy is to combine layers of images of varying resolution. A second strategy involves comparing the a posteriori probabilities of each class at different resolutions. Another strategy is based on a top-down approach starting with the coarsest resolution.The multiresolution strategies are tested using simulated multiresolution images for a portion of the rural-urban fringe of the San Diego Metropolitan Area. The classification accuracy obtained from using three multiple strategies was greater when compared with that from a conventional single-resolution approach. Among the three strategies, the top-down approach resulted in the highest classification accuracy with a Kappa value of 0.648, compared to a Kappa of 0.566 for the conventional classifier.

                Updating digital map databases to reflect continuous changes is a major task, which could be significantly reduced by introducing an automated change-detection process. We suggest an algorithm inspired by the specific problem of updating the Danish National Topographic Map Database (TOP10DK). The emphasis is on buildings, which are very important mapping objects. The algorithm uses vector and spectral data as input to an unsupervised spectral classification method which controls a subsequent Mahalanobis classification step. For evaluation, we present four test cases based on the TOP10DK database in combination with RGB and color-infrared (CIR) aerial photos. A main problem is roofs covered with roofing felt, which are hard to discriminate spectrally from roads. Apart from that, RGB photos are barely sufficient for change detection, while CIR data give more satisfactory results. Refinements are, however, still needed to reduce the number of false alarms.
