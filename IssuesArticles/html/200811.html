                Due to the significant time and cost requirements of traditional mapping techniques, accurate and detailed habitat maps for large areas are uncommon. This study investigates the application of Ikonos Very High Resolution (VHR) images to habitat mapping in the rugged terrain of Hong Kong’s country parks. A required mapping scale of 1:10 000, a minimum map object size of 150 m2 on the ground, and a minimum accuracy level of 80 percent were set as the mapping standards. Very high quality aerial photographs and digital topographic maps provided accurate reference data for the image processing and habitat classification. A comparison between manual stereoscopic aerial photographic interpretation and image classification using pixel-based and object-based classifiers was carried out. The Multi-level Object Oriented Segmentation with Decision Tree Classification (MOOSC) was devised during this study using a suite of image processing techniques to integrate spectral, textural, and spatial criteria with ancillary data. Manual mapping from air photos combined with fieldwork obtained the best result, with 95 percent overall accuracy, but both this and the MOOSC method, with 94 percent, easily met the 80 percent specified accuracy standard. The MOOSC method was able to achieve similar accuracy aerial photographs, but at only one third of the cost.

                The aim of this paper was to examine the potential of Ikonos satellite images for estimating boreal forest stand characteristics using frequency distributions of radiometric values. The spectral features selected for use in the estimation were medians, standard deviations, and the parameters of the two-parametric Weibull distribution derived from the standwise spectral histograms of the Ikonos image. Ancillary map information, such as land-use and peatland classes, was also included. The method of estimation was nonparametric k-most similar neighbors (K-MSN) method. The most accurate results were achieved using spectral features that were derived from the multispectral images. The lowest RMSEs for the mean total stem volume, basal area, and mean height were 52.2 m3/ha (31.3 percent), 5.6 m2/ha (25.3 percent), and 3.1 m (20.6 percent), respectively. When only the panchromatic image was used in the analysis, the RMSEs for the mean total stem volume and basal area were about 3 percentage points higher. No differences in the mean height estimates were observed between the multispectral and panchromatic images. The most efficient predictor variables were the medians and the scale parameters of the Weibull distribution. The use of classified map information did not improve the results. The findings suggest that Ikonos satellite images can be used in to estimate forest stand characteristics giving an accuracy that corresponds to that achieved with aerial photographs.

                The topographic effect on land surface reflectance is an important factor affecting quantitative analysis of remotely sensed data in mountainous regions. Different approaches have been developed to reduce topographical effects. Of the many methods, the Minnaert correction method is most frequently used for topographic correction, but a single global Minnaert value used in previous research cannot effectively reduce topographic effects on the remotely sensed data, especially in the areas with steep slopes. This paper explores the method to develop a pixel-based Minnaert coefficient image based on the established relationship between Minnaert coefficients and topographic slopes. A texture measure based on homogeneity is used to eva-luate the topographic correction result. This study has demonstrated promising in reducing topographic effects on the Landsat ETM+ image with the pixel-based Minnnaert correction method.

                Brightness, Greenness, and Wetness Tasselled Cap parameters were derived for the SPOT5 sensor. Their robustness through space and time and their discrimination power in land-cover classes was investigated. Four images were acquired from March and September 2003, and in July and November 2004 over Germany. A fifth SPOT5 image was acquired from Cameroon, West Africa in January 2003. The Tasselled Cap parameters were extracted with the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization technique for each image independently. One set of combined parameters was created for Germany using samples from the four SPOT5 images simultaneously. Each SPOT5 image was transformed into Brightness, Greenness, and Wetness with their own with the combined and the July parameters. Spearman’s Rho correlation analysis was carried out between the Tasselled Cap counterparts acquired with the various parameters. Brightness exhibited nearly perfect correlations between the images in Germany; in Cameroon however, the images were inconsistent. Greenness and Wetness displayed a difference of up to 35 percent in November in Germany. The Wetness counterparts in Cameroon exhibited a 7 percent difference. Canonical discrimination analysis revealed that the components from July had the highest discrimination power and that Greenness expressed the highest association to the first canonical axis in all images. In March, July, and November, Brightness was the second most important Tasselled Cap component, in September the Wetness and in Cameroon the Greenness. These results indicate that the Tasselled Cap components are not stable between different seasons and geographical locations. They can be successfully used for land-cover discrimination if the images are transformed with parameters appropriate to the investigated season respective biogeographical zone.

                This paper presents a novel approach for automation in roof extraction from two solved aerial images. The approach assumes that roofs are composed of several spatial polygons, and that they can be obtained by extracting all or even only some of them if the model is known. In view of this assumption, innovative algorithms for semi-automatic spatial polygon extraction were developed. These algorithms are based on a 2D approach to solving the 3D reality. Based on these algorithms, an interactive and semi-automatic modelbased approach for automation in roof extraction was developed. The approach is composed of two phases: manual (interactive) and automatic. In the manual (interactive) phase, the operator needs to choose an Expanded Parameterized Model (EPM) from a knowledge base and select one pre-prepared Interactive Option for Extraction (IOE) of the roof. Then, the operator needs to point according to the guidelines of the chosen option in the left image space. In the automatic phase, the selected spatial polygons are extracted, the parameters of the selected model are calculated and the roof is reconstructed. The approach was examined and the results we obtained had standard accuracy. It appears that the approach can be implemented on many types of roofs and under diverse photographic conditions. In this paper, the algorithms, the experiments and the results are detailed.

                Classification-trees were used to model forest type groups and forest types for the conterminous United States and Alaska. The predictor data were a geospatial data set with a spatial resolution of 250 m developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service (USFS). The response data were plot data from the USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis program. Overall accuracies for the conterminous U.S. for the forest type group and forest type were 69 percent (Kappa = 0.66) and 50 percent (Kappa = 0.57), respectively. The overall accuracies for Alaska for the forest type group and forest type were 78 percent (Kappa = 0.69) and 67 percent (Kappa = 0.61), respectively. This is the first forest type map produced for the U.S. The forest type group map is an update of a previous forest type group map created by Zhu and Evans (1994).

                The confounding effect of understory vegetation contributions to satellite-derived estimates of leaf area index (LAI) was investigated on two loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) forest stands located in Virginia and North Carolina. In order to separate NDVI contributions of the dominant-codominate crown class from that of the understory, twoP.taeda 1 ha plots centered in planted stands of ages 19 and 23 years with similar crown closures (71 percent) were analyzed for in situ LAI and NDVI differences following a complete understory removal at the peak period of LAI. Understory vegetation was removed from both stands using mechanical harvest and herbicide application in late July and early August 2002. Ikonos data was acquired both prior and subsequent to understory removal and were evaluated for NDVI response. Total vegetative biomass removed under the canopies was estimated using the Tracing Radiation and Architecture of Canopies (TRAC) instrument combined with digital hemispherical photography (DHP). Within-image NDVI change detection analysis (CDA) on the Virginia site showed that the percentage of removed understory (LAI) detected by the Ikonos sensor was 5.0 percent when compared to an actual in situ LAI reduction of 10.0 percent. The North Carolina site results showed a smaller percentage of reduced understory LAI detected by the Ikonos sensor (1.8 percent) when compared to the actual LAI reduction as measured in situ (17.4 percent). Image-to-image NDVI CDA proved problematic due to the time period between the Ikonos image collections (2.5 to 3 months). Sensor and solar position differences between the two collections, along with pine LAI increases through multiple needle flush, exaggerated NDVI reductions when compared to in situ data.

            An Initial Study on Vehicle Information Extraction from Single Pass QuickBird Satellite Imagery

                Vehicle information is useful in many fields. In this paper, a technique is presented to extract vehicle information from single pass QuickBird images. While passing a target area, the satellite acquires panchromatic (PAN) and multi-spectral (MS) images simultaneously. Because of a small time interval difference between the PAN andMSimages, it is theoretically possible to extract two sets of vehicle ground positions from the PAN and MS images, respectively, to identify whether or not a vehicle is in motion, and to calculate the vehicle’;s velocity and direction. Practically, however, this extraction and calculation are challenging. Since the time interval is very short, a small error in information extraction will result in an unacceptably large error in the calculated vehicle position and velocity. Another challenge is that satellite image pairs (PAN and MS) do not have the same resolution. Therefore, traditional change detection techniques are incapable of providing reliable results, due to varying scales and relief distortions in the co-registered images or slight pixel shifts in the orthorectified images caused by resampling of the PAN and MS images. In order to avoid these errors, this research presents an algorithm through which a vehicle’s ground positions can be directly calculated from the raw PAN and MS images. Experiments demonstrate that it is feasible to use this technique to extract vehicle information from high-resolution images obtained from a single satellite pass.

                A comparison of land-cover maps, emphasizing row crop agriculture, resulting from independent classifications of coincident Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Resourcesat-1 Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWIFS) imagery is presented. Three agriculturally intensive study areas within the midsection of the United States were analyzed during the peak of their growing season. For each region the data were collected within the same hour during August 2005. Identical decision tree style classification methodologies relying on ground truth from the June Agricultural Survey were applied to the image pairs for each of the three cases. The direct comparison of mapping accuracy results show, on average, the TM output to perform slightly better than that of the complimentary AWIFS. It is concluded AWIFS is a valid alternative to TM for classifying cultivated agriculture in areas with reasonably large field sizes. Furthermore, AWIFS offers increased benefits due to larger swath widths and shorter revisit frequencies.

                During the past several years, point density covering topographic objects with airborne lidar (Light Detection And Ranging) technology has been greatly improved. This achievement provides an improved ability for reconstructing more complicated building roof structures; more specifically, those comprising various model primitives horizontally and/or vertically. However, the technology for automatically reconstructing such a complicated structure is thus far poorly understood and is currently based on employing a limited number of pre-specified building primitives. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a new technique of modeling 3D building objects using a data-driven approach whereby densely collecting low-level modeling cues from lidar data are used in the modeling process. The core of the proposed method is to globally reconstruct geometric topology between adjacent linear features by adopting a BSP (Binary Space Partitioning) tree. The proposed algorithm consists of four steps: (a) detecting individual buildings from lidar data, (b) clustering laser points by height and planar similarity, (c) extracting rectilinear lines, and (d) planar partitioning and merging for the generation of polyhedral models. This paper demonstrates the efficacy of the algorithm for creating complex models of building rooftops in 3D space from airborne lidar data.

                Due to the significant time and cost requirements of traditional mapping techniques, accurate and detailed habitat maps for large areas are uncommon. This study investigates the application of Ikonos Very High Resolution (VHR) images to habitat mapping in the rugged terrain of Hong Kong’s country parks. A required mapping scale of 1:10 000, a minimum map object size of 150 m2 on the ground, and a minimum accuracy level of 80 percent were set as the mapping standards. Very high quality aerial photographs and digital topographic maps provided accurate reference data for the image processing and habitat classification. A comparison between manual stereoscopic aerial photographic interpretation and image classification using pixel-based and object-based classifiers was carried out. The Multi-level Object Oriented Segmentation with Decision Tree Classification (MOOSC) was devised during this study using a suite of image processing techniques to integrate spectral, textural, and spatial criteria with ancillary data. Manual mapping from air photos combined with fieldwork obtained the best result, with 95 percent overall accuracy, but both this and the MOOSC method, with 94 percent, easily met the 80 percent specified accuracy standard. The MOOSC method was able to achieve similar accuracy aerial photographs, but at only one third of the cost.

                The aim of this paper was to examine the potential of Ikonos satellite images for estimating boreal forest stand characteristics using frequency distributions of radiometric values. The spectral features selected for use in the estimation were medians, standard deviations, and the parameters of the two-parametric Weibull distribution derived from the standwise spectral histograms of the Ikonos image. Ancillary map information, such as land-use and peatland classes, was also included. The method of estimation was nonparametric k-most similar neighbors (K-MSN) method. The most accurate results were achieved using spectral features that were derived from the multispectral images. The lowest RMSEs for the mean total stem volume, basal area, and mean height were 52.2 m3/ha (31.3 percent), 5.6 m2/ha (25.3 percent), and 3.1 m (20.6 percent), respectively. When only the panchromatic image was used in the analysis, the RMSEs for the mean total stem volume and basal area were about 3 percentage points higher. No differences in the mean height estimates were observed between the multispectral and panchromatic images. The most efficient predictor variables were the medians and the scale parameters of the Weibull distribution. The use of classified map information did not improve the results. The findings suggest that Ikonos satellite images can be used in to estimate forest stand characteristics giving an accuracy that corresponds to that achieved with aerial photographs.

                The topographic effect on land surface reflectance is an important factor affecting quantitative analysis of remotely sensed data in mountainous regions. Different approaches have been developed to reduce topographical effects. Of the many methods, the Minnaert correction method is most frequently used for topographic correction, but a single global Minnaert value used in previous research cannot effectively reduce topographic effects on the remotely sensed data, especially in the areas with steep slopes. This paper explores the method to develop a pixel-based Minnaert coefficient image based on the established relationship between Minnaert coefficients and topographic slopes. A texture measure based on homogeneity is used to eva-luate the topographic correction result. This study has demonstrated promising in reducing topographic effects on the Landsat ETM+ image with the pixel-based Minnnaert correction method.

                Brightness, Greenness, and Wetness Tasselled Cap parameters were derived for the SPOT5 sensor. Their robustness through space and time and their discrimination power in land-cover classes was investigated. Four images were acquired from March and September 2003, and in July and November 2004 over Germany. A fifth SPOT5 image was acquired from Cameroon, West Africa in January 2003. The Tasselled Cap parameters were extracted with the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization technique for each image independently. One set of combined parameters was created for Germany using samples from the four SPOT5 images simultaneously. Each SPOT5 image was transformed into Brightness, Greenness, and Wetness with their own with the combined and the July parameters. Spearman’s Rho correlation analysis was carried out between the Tasselled Cap counterparts acquired with the various parameters. Brightness exhibited nearly perfect correlations between the images in Germany; in Cameroon however, the images were inconsistent. Greenness and Wetness displayed a difference of up to 35 percent in November in Germany. The Wetness counterparts in Cameroon exhibited a 7 percent difference. Canonical discrimination analysis revealed that the components from July had the highest discrimination power and that Greenness expressed the highest association to the first canonical axis in all images. In March, July, and November, Brightness was the second most important Tasselled Cap component, in September the Wetness and in Cameroon the Greenness. These results indicate that the Tasselled Cap components are not stable between different seasons and geographical locations. They can be successfully used for land-cover discrimination if the images are transformed with parameters appropriate to the investigated season respective biogeographical zone.

                This paper presents a novel approach for automation in roof extraction from two solved aerial images. The approach assumes that roofs are composed of several spatial polygons, and that they can be obtained by extracting all or even only some of them if the model is known. In view of this assumption, innovative algorithms for semi-automatic spatial polygon extraction were developed. These algorithms are based on a 2D approach to solving the 3D reality. Based on these algorithms, an interactive and semi-automatic modelbased approach for automation in roof extraction was developed. The approach is composed of two phases: manual (interactive) and automatic. In the manual (interactive) phase, the operator needs to choose an Expanded Parameterized Model (EPM) from a knowledge base and select one pre-prepared Interactive Option for Extraction (IOE) of the roof. Then, the operator needs to point according to the guidelines of the chosen option in the left image space. In the automatic phase, the selected spatial polygons are extracted, the parameters of the selected model are calculated and the roof is reconstructed. The approach was examined and the results we obtained had standard accuracy. It appears that the approach can be implemented on many types of roofs and under diverse photographic conditions. In this paper, the algorithms, the experiments and the results are detailed.

                Classification-trees were used to model forest type groups and forest types for the conterminous United States and Alaska. The predictor data were a geospatial data set with a spatial resolution of 250 m developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service (USFS). The response data were plot data from the USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis program. Overall accuracies for the conterminous U.S. for the forest type group and forest type were 69 percent (Kappa = 0.66) and 50 percent (Kappa = 0.57), respectively. The overall accuracies for Alaska for the forest type group and forest type were 78 percent (Kappa = 0.69) and 67 percent (Kappa = 0.61), respectively. This is the first forest type map produced for the U.S. The forest type group map is an update of a previous forest type group map created by Zhu and Evans (1994).

                The confounding effect of understory vegetation contributions to satellite-derived estimates of leaf area index (LAI) was investigated on two loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) forest stands located in Virginia and North Carolina. In order to separate NDVI contributions of the dominant-codominate crown class from that of the understory, twoP.taeda 1 ha plots centered in planted stands of ages 19 and 23 years with similar crown closures (71 percent) were analyzed for in situ LAI and NDVI differences following a complete understory removal at the peak period of LAI. Understory vegetation was removed from both stands using mechanical harvest and herbicide application in late July and early August 2002. Ikonos data was acquired both prior and subsequent to understory removal and were evaluated for NDVI response. Total vegetative biomass removed under the canopies was estimated using the Tracing Radiation and Architecture of Canopies (TRAC) instrument combined with digital hemispherical photography (DHP). Within-image NDVI change detection analysis (CDA) on the Virginia site showed that the percentage of removed understory (LAI) detected by the Ikonos sensor was 5.0 percent when compared to an actual in situ LAI reduction of 10.0 percent. The North Carolina site results showed a smaller percentage of reduced understory LAI detected by the Ikonos sensor (1.8 percent) when compared to the actual LAI reduction as measured in situ (17.4 percent). Image-to-image NDVI CDA proved problematic due to the time period between the Ikonos image collections (2.5 to 3 months). Sensor and solar position differences between the two collections, along with pine LAI increases through multiple needle flush, exaggerated NDVI reductions when compared to in situ data.

                Vehicle information is useful in many fields. In this paper, a technique is presented to extract vehicle information from single pass QuickBird images. While passing a target area, the satellite acquires panchromatic (PAN) and multi-spectral (MS) images simultaneously. Because of a small time interval difference between the PAN andMSimages, it is theoretically possible to extract two sets of vehicle ground positions from the PAN and MS images, respectively, to identify whether or not a vehicle is in motion, and to calculate the vehicle’;s velocity and direction. Practically, however, this extraction and calculation are challenging. Since the time interval is very short, a small error in information extraction will result in an unacceptably large error in the calculated vehicle position and velocity. Another challenge is that satellite image pairs (PAN and MS) do not have the same resolution. Therefore, traditional change detection techniques are incapable of providing reliable results, due to varying scales and relief distortions in the co-registered images or slight pixel shifts in the orthorectified images caused by resampling of the PAN and MS images. In order to avoid these errors, this research presents an algorithm through which a vehicle’s ground positions can be directly calculated from the raw PAN and MS images. Experiments demonstrate that it is feasible to use this technique to extract vehicle information from high-resolution images obtained from a single satellite pass.

                A comparison of land-cover maps, emphasizing row crop agriculture, resulting from independent classifications of coincident Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Resourcesat-1 Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWIFS) imagery is presented. Three agriculturally intensive study areas within the midsection of the United States were analyzed during the peak of their growing season. For each region the data were collected within the same hour during August 2005. Identical decision tree style classification methodologies relying on ground truth from the June Agricultural Survey were applied to the image pairs for each of the three cases. The direct comparison of mapping accuracy results show, on average, the TM output to perform slightly better than that of the complimentary AWIFS. It is concluded AWIFS is a valid alternative to TM for classifying cultivated agriculture in areas with reasonably large field sizes. Furthermore, AWIFS offers increased benefits due to larger swath widths and shorter revisit frequencies.
