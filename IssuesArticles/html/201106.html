                This article compares the use ofADS40-52,DMC, and ULTRA-CAMD digital airborne camera imagery for mapping benthic habitat and identifying boat propeller scars in seagrass habitats. The three image data sets were collected over Redfish Bay, Texas on the same day, under almost identical environmental conditions. Next, the data sets were compared to each another using a variety of criteria. Finally, automated methods were used to create maps of propeller scars and the accuracy of each map was analyzed. Significant findings include• Digital airborne ADS40-52, DMC, and ULTRACAM imagery can be used to effectively map benthic habitat and propeller scars.• Imagery from the DMC and ADS40-52 had the highest spatial accuracy.• Spectral separatability of benthic habitat class and propeller scars is best in the DMC and the ADS40-52 imagery.• The accuracy of propeller scar maps was highest for maps produced from the ADS40-52 data.

                The objective of the research study is to use the synergy of 3D empirical (Rational Function Model (RFM) and physical (Toutin’s) geometric models to develop a “new hybrid” model for the geometric processing of Radarsat-2 data without collecting ground control point (GCP). After independently evaluating the processing and the accuracy of each model using accurate differential GPS points, RFM was thus used to generate few “virtual” RFM points at the highest elevation of the study site. In addition to information of the metadata, these “virtual” points were input as GCPs in Toutin’s model. This “new hybrid model consistently achieved pixel accuracy, with better results for steep looking angles than the two other models. Its main advantage was, in addition, to be used without collecting GCP, increasing the applicability of Radarsat-2 data in remote areas.

                Wide-baseline mapping technology has been applied in NASA’s Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission to improve the accuracy of mapping of far-range terrain from Rover stereo images. As a basic research topic in photogrammetry and computer vision, it is desirable to perform a comprehensive investigation on the accuracy and automation of wide-baseline mapping. This paper presents the results of a systematic accuracy analysis of wide-baseline mapping through theoretical derivation and Monte Carlo simulation. Automated bundle adjustment and 3D wide-baseline mapping techniques are developed and tested using wide-baseline images acquired by the Spirit Rover. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques and verify that the mapping capability of rover stereo images can be extended from tens of meters (hard-baseline) to hundreds of meters using wide-baseline mapping techniques.

                This research is committed to develop a semi-automated landforms classification method for a subtropical area located in the southeast of Brazil, using optical medium-resolution imagery from ASTER/Terra. A four-level semantic network driven by a set of spectral, textural, and geomorphometric variables was used. The textural and geomorpho-metric variables were extracted from an ASTER/Terra DEM. The semantic network was initially conceived to classify macro morphogenetic landforms and was then further detailed to allow a finer classification, which amounted to eleven classes of morphographic landforms. In order to assess the classification accuracy, statistical indices were derived from a contingency table obtained by means of a comparison between the classified scene and a reference map. The final agreement indices for the macro and detailed landforms classifications were 76 percent and 80 percent, respectively. The employed object-based image analysis has proved to be a suitable method for semiautomated procedures in the classification of landforms.

                Wall painting plays an important role in the culture relics of the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang, P.R. China. A novel approach of generating a high-resolution orthoimage of the wall painting is proposed. Since the photographic object is nearly flat and also the forward overlap between adjacent images is smaller than 60 percent, the main difficulty to be resolved is the high correlation problem among the unknowns. Improved models of relative orientation and bundle adjustment with virtual constraints have been developed to resolve the high correlation problem. A Voronoi diagram of projective footprints is applied to automatically determine the mosaic lines of ortho-rectified images. The color quality of the generated orthoimage is improved through global minimization of the color differences among overlapped images. The experimental results show that the proposed approach has great potential for conservation of wall paintings with sub-millimeter to millimeter precision.
