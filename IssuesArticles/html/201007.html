                This study estimated the urban population of the Wasatch Front of Utah, USA by Census Block Group (CBG) using spectral variables derived from Landsat TM reflectance as predictors. Using 353 training CBGs and 446 validation CBGs, five regression models and twenty back-propagation neural network models were built and tested. The median percentage of error in the best and worst models was 25 percent and 50 percent, respectively. Neural network models generally provided better predictions than multiple regression models. The factors most highly related to population density included spectral variance in reflectance; contrast between urban vegetation and dark material (e.g., asphalt); contrast between vegetation and bare soil; total albedo, and thermal temperature.

                The goals of this research were to examine the effects of climate, land-use, and plot-level characteristics on interan-nual change of vegetation characteristics. Using mixed-effects regression models, we examined the influences of climatic limiting factors and plot-level characteristics on annual fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fAPAR) estimates from MODIS 250 m resolution data across agricultural and restored prairie plots in Iowa. Prairie plots had significantly higher annual fAPAR and less year-to-year variability than highly intensive agriculture. Comparisons between fixed and random effects models show that differential climate responses between land-use types explain approximately 85 percent of between pixel differences. Year-to-year climate differences and pixel scale land-use factors explained approximately 48 percent of agriculture within-plot trends and interannual variability and 54 percent of prairie year-to-year variance. Agriculture responses were predominantly influenced by precipitation and prairies were primarily influenced by incident radiation and age since restoration.

            A Volumetric Approach to Change Detection in Satellite Images

                The increasing availability of very high resolution satellite imagery has spurred interest in automatically detecting very fine detailed changes in an area over time, a particularly useful tool for analyzing activity in dense urban areas. However, attempting automated change detection at this resolution is difficult due to the motion parallax of elevated structures. This paper presents a comprehensive solution to change detection in areas of significant 3D relief using a new framework called volumetric appearance modeling (VAM). This approach can manage the complications of unknown and changing world surfaces by maintaining a 3D voxel-based model, where probability distributions for surface occupancy and image appearance are stored in each voxel. These distributions are continuously updated as new images are received using an adaptive learning procedure. This representation is demonstrated to produce accurate change detection results under conditions of variable illumination and viewpoint as well as haze conditions present in satellite imagery. The volumetric representation also supports automatic sensor model correction to align incoming imagery to a common geographic reference. This registration approach is demonstrated to achieve geo-positioning accuracy on the order of the ground sampling distance (GSD) or better.

                Large area land-cover mapping involving large volumes of data is becoming more common in remote sensing applications. Thus, there is a pressing need for increased automation in the land-cover mapping process. The main objective of this research was to compare the performance of three machine learning algorithms (MLAS) for mapping wetlands in the Sanjiang Plain combined Landsat TM imagery with ancillary geographical data. Three MLAS included random forest (RF), classification and regression tree (CART), and maximum likelihood classification (MLC). Comparisons were based on several criteria: overall accuracy, sensitivity to data set size, and noise. Our results indicated that first, the random forest and CART approach can achieve substantial improvements in accuracy over the traditional MLC method. Random forest produced the highest overall accuracy (91.3 percent) the kappa coefficient 0.8943, with marsh class accuracies ranging from 77.4 percent to 90.0 percent. Secondly, the random forest method was least sensitive to reduction in training sample size, and it was most resistant to the presence of noise compared to CART and MLC. The comparison between three MLAS revealed that the random forest approach was most resistant to training data deficiencies while improved land-cover map accuracy in marsh area.

                Road vectorization aims to delineate road centerlines from aerial and satellite images. In this paper, binary road image space clustering techniques, which are used to determine key points on the road, are expanded to a more accurate and reliable algorithm, the Increasing Ellipse Clustering technique. Accurate noise cluster recognition and omission are two strengths of the proposed algorithm. In order to establish the true connections between predetermined key points on the road, a very fast, novel, and reliable fuzzy ellipse-shaped clustering methodology is introduced. Different accuracy assessment parameters are established and evaluated based on results obtained for simulated and real road binary images. The sub-pixel geometric accuracy of the extracted road network, with a completeness of more than 80 percent, demonstrates the promising results of the vectorization algorithm that is presented in this paper.

                This study analyzed the relationship between landscape homogeneity and fire hazard for a certain area and time period (1984 to 1995), by using logit models. Homogeneity was measured though eight texture measurements computed on visible and NIR bands of Landstat-5 TM data with varying kernel sizes. Several significant models could be developed to predict future burning at the pixel level for the study period. The best spectral band for detecting proneness to burn was TM1, the blue band, and best results were achieved with large window sizes and the Homogeneity texture measure.
