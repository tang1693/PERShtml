                Recently, classification of urban area based on multi-sensor fusion has been widely investigated. In this paper, the potential of using visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) hyperspectral images fusion for classification of urban area is evaluated. For this purpose, comprehensive spatial-spectral feature space is generated which includes vegetation index, differential morphological profile (DMP), attribute profile (AP), texture, geostatistical features, structural feature set (SFS) and local statistical descriptors from both datasets in addition to original datasets. Although Support Vector Machine (SVM) is an appropriate tool in the classification of high dimensional feature space, its performance is significantly affected by its parameters and feature space. Cuckoo search (CS) optimization algorithm with mixed binary-continuous coding is proposed for feature selection andSVMparameter determination simultaneously. Moreover, the significance of each selected feature category in the classification of a specific object is verified. Accuracy assessment on two subsets shows that stacking ofVISandTIRbands can improve the classification performance to 87 percent and 82 percent for two subsets, compare toVISimage (72 percent and 80 percent) andTIRimage (50 percent and 56 percent). However, the optimum results obtained based on the proposed method which gains 94 percent and 92 percent. Furthermore, results show that usingTIRbesideVISimage improves classification accuracy of roads and buildings in urban area.

                Recently, combined use of lidar and optical data has been extensively employed to achieve 3D modeling of buildings. In the first step of this research, lidar point cloud is clustered into roof's major and minor planes. A FAST algorithm is used to extract roof corners from a 2D optical data. Afterwards, residue of the anomalies is obtained through subtraction of main planes' DSM from DSM of the lidar point cloud. Using a Canny operator, edges of the residue's anomalies image are extracted and then superimposed on the optical image to find appropriate corners. In the second step, shape descriptors related to all possible polygons formed by the corners are computed and compared against the ones, which are obtained from the extracted edges. Then, the polygon with the most similar shape descriptor would be chosen as the optimal polygon representing the roof structure of interest. In third step, planes are intersected and initial 3D roof model is reconstructed. It is added to 3D optimized roof model formed by 2D optimal polygon and minor planes which results in secondary 3D reconstructed roof model. Finally, a wire frame model is generated by vertexes. The results indicate efficiency of the residue of the anomalies and shape descriptors for buildings' roof modeling.

                This study details the development of a U. S. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico above-ground forest biomass (AGB) product (baseline 2000) developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that was compared to anotherAGBproduct developed by the U. S. Forest Service (USFS) for the same area. TheUSEPAproduct tended to over-predict in areas of low biomass and under-predict in high biomass areas when compared to observed plot data, but compared favorably to a Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) assessment of structure and condition of Puerto Rico forests (72.6 Mg/ha versus 80.0 Mg/ ha, respectively).AGBestimates were highly correlated with referenceFIAbiomass for both maps at their native spatial resolutions (USEPA: r =0.93,USFS: r = 0.92).AGBmean difference between both products was 33.5 Mg/ha (USFSmean = 106.1 Mg/ha;USEPAmean = 72.6 Mg/ha), a difference not out-of-scope when compared to other biomass comparative studies.

            Multilayer NMF for Blind Unmixing of Hyperspectral Imagery with Additional Constraints
        </a>

                Due to the coincidence of hyperspectral reflectance nonnegativity (and its corresponding abundance) with nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) methods,NMFhas been widely applied to unmix hyperspectral images in recent years. However, many local minima persist because of the nonconvexity of the objective function. Thus, the nonnegativity constraint is not sufficient and additional auxiliary constraints should be applied to objective functions. In this paper, a new approach we call constrained multilayerNMF(CMLNMF), is proposed for hyperspectral data. In this approach, the mixed spectra are regarded as endmember signatures that has been contaminated by multiplicative noise. The purpose ofCMLNMFis to eliminate noise by hierarchical processing until the endmember spectra are obtained. Also, the hierarchical processing is self-adaptive to make the algorithm more effective. Furthermore, in each layer two constraints are implemented on the objective function. One is sparseness on the abundance matrix and the other is minimum volume on the spectral matrix. The hierarchical processing separates the abundance matrix into a series of matrices that make the characteristic of sparseness more obvious and meaningful. The proposed algorithm is applied to synthetic data and real hyperspectral data for quantitative evaluation. According to the comparison with other algorithms,CMLNMFhas better performance and provides effective solutions for blind unmixing of hyperspectral image data.

                Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are significantly changing the field of remote sensing. Seasoned scholars, enthusiasts, and novices alike are adaptingUAVsto better understand our world. In this paper, we provide an overview of the implications of the continued integration ofUAVsinto civilian remote sensing. Our review suggests thatUAVtechnical capabilities rival that of conventional airborne remote sensing, while the flexibility and agility ofUAVsallow these devices to be used to study phenomena not previously possible. While commercially-builtUAVsare favored in commercial applications, do-it-yourself forums are allowing scholars to benefit from these devices. But while there is excitement aroundUAVs, ethical, safety, and privacy concerns continue to linger. Therefore, in urging scholars to embraceUAVtechnologies, we caution them to take steps to ensure good choices are made so that both humanity and remote sensing can continue to benefit from the presence of these devices.
