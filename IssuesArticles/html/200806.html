                In this article, we simulate forest fragmentation patterns by reference to the actual decision-making of the agents engaged in the fragmentation process itself. We take as our empirical case fragmentation in the Brazilian Amazon basin associated with road-building by loggers. Roads built by the private sector, particularly loggers, play a decisive role in the dynamics of frontier expansion in the Amazon. Our objective is to explain the manner in which logging roads manifest spatially, thereby creating fragmented landscapes in a small portion of the so-called “Terra do Meio,” a region of 300,000 km2in the heart of the Amazon basin. We combine geostatistical methods with GIS to replicate a common fragmentation pattern found in tropical forests known as dendritic. Such fragmentation has been identified as one of the three most common types observed in the Amazon basin. The model replicates the general dendritic pattern and many branching points of the network, although segments do not overlay precisely. The paper concludes with a discussion of steps necessary to develop a model that is fully effective in describing the spatial decision-making of loggers.

                African oil palm (Elaeis guinensis) is the most productive oil seed. Globally, the oil palm industry plans to double the area under cultivation to meet growing demands for both vegetable oils and biodiesel. Accurate assessment and monitoring of African palm extensification and intensification for both development and sustainability is crucial given that these crops are replacing the natural high-biodiversity forests as well as local subsistence agriculture. Using a simultaneous collection of RADARSAT synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and ground based digital video, we describe and model the spatial distribution of African palm and explore its lifecycle placing it in the regional ecological context of the Ecuadorian, Amazon. We evaluate the strengths and limitations of integrating RADARSAT texture information, Landsat ETM+, and digital video data to distinguish African oil palm plantations from other land-use and land-cover (LULC) categories. The grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and a separate hybrid classification approach using a concatenation of SAR-optical products were tested. A significant improvement in the classification accuracy of African palm in the context of the Ecuadorian Amazon was obtained through the fusion of optical and RADARSAT texture measures as compared to single sensor classifications. The fusion of single ETM+ bands with texture measures achieved the highest user’s and producer’s accuracy with 83 percent and 90 percent, respectively.

            Integration of Hyperion Satellite Data and A Household Social Survey to Characterize the Causes and Consequences of Reforestation Patterns in the Northern Ecuadorian Amazon

                The integration of Hyperion and Ikonos imagery are used to differentiate the subtle spectral differences of land-use/land-cover types on household farms in the Northern Ecuadorian Amazon (NEA) with an emphasis on secondary and successional forests. Approaches are examined that include the use of Principal Components Analysis to compress the Hyperion hyperspectral data to its most vital spectral channels; linear mixture modeling to derive sub-pixel fractions of land-use/land-cover types through the generation of spectral endmembers; and supervised and unsupervised classifications to map forest regrowth, agricultural crops and pasture, and other land-uses on 18 survey farms that are spatially coincident with the imagery. A longitudinal socio-economic and demographic survey (1990 and 1999) is used to characterize household farms; a community survey (2000) is used to assess nearby market towns and service centers; GIS is used to represent the resource endowments of farms and their geographic accessibility. Statistical relationships are examined using Spear-man rank correlation coefficients to assess the linkages among a number of selected social, geographical, and biophysical variables and secondary and successional forest on household farms. Relationships suggest the importance of household characteristics, farm resources, and geographic access of secondary forests on surveyed household farms that were previously deforested and converted to agriculture through extensification processes. Results support the integrated use of hyperspectral and hyper-spatial data for characterizing forest regrowth on household farms, and the use of multi-dimensional social survey data and GIS to assess plausible causes and consequences of land-use/land-cover dynamics in the NEA.

                This paper explores the temporal composition of the main Land-use/Land-cover (LULC) trajectories, examines the spatial configuration of the trajectories, and derives the probabilities of transitions in the Northern Ecuadorian Amazon (NEA). This research uses a time-series of classified Landsat images that ranges from 1974 to 2002, and a set of spatial socioeconomic, demographic, and accessibility data assembled in a geographic information system. The LULC trajectories are analyzed for the Northern Intensive Study Area (NISA) using image algebra, and for the whole region, the NEA, using cluster analysis, landscape ecology principles, and spatial logistic regression models. In general, the trajectories are dominated (i.e., in terms of area) by recent transitions that contain forested classes (i.e., primary forest or succession), as well as the consistent representation of pasture through time. This exploratory analysis of LULC transitions suggests a set of clusters that form a “core and periphery” pattern in the NEA. This research shows how these clusters and probabilities of change can be used to characterize trajectories of LULC in the region.

                Focused on the Okavango Delta, Botswana, this research investigates (a) whether ecosystem signals derived from remotely sensed imagery can be decomposed using a harmonic regression, (b) if the deviations from the decomposed signal are correlated with observed flooding and fire regimes, and (c) the impact of explicitly including agriculture, settlement areas, and land management systems on the derived signals. A time-series of 85 TM/ETM+ scenes spanning the period from 1989 through 2002 was used to decompose derived landscape dynamics into trends, annual and seasonal cycles, and long term oscillations. The harmonic fit largely defined by climatic periodicities (semi-annual, annual, and quasidecadal) accounted for 63 percent to 88 percent of the variance in the trajectories. The trends were found to be robust whether or not urban settlement or landscape management regimes were explicitly included, though there was a reversal of trend in agricultural areas.

                Soil crop suitability data was used to characterize and evaluate land-use/land-cover (LULC) classifications derived from Landsat TM and MSS imagery for 1997, 1985, and 1972. Landsat spectral classifications were post-processed using GIS data into a time-series of pixels that were identified as having agricultural potential (not including household gardens within settlements), and then compared with soil suitability variables to characterize LULC patterns and assess the likelihood of potential for land degradation within the Nang Rong, Thailand study area. Results of this estimate indicate that for extensive areas of upland cash cropping, particularly in the case of cassava, a significant potential for land degradation and hence agro-ecological unsustainability exists. Lowland rain-fed rice cropping, the most areally extensive and temporally persistent form of agriculture, is revealed to be largely agro-ecologically sustainable. A trend in the Nang Rong region is towards planting fast growing eucalyptus trees, a non-native species known to be damaging to the soil and ecology, as a cash crop in both upland and lowland settings for pulpwood, construction framing, and biofuel feedstock, making future potential land degradation scenarios somewhat different than in the past and ongoing monitoring critical.

                Inhabitants near Poyang Lake, in the Central Yangtze River Basin, China, are vulnerable to loss of life and livelihood because of the interactions of flooding and land-use policies and decisions. We analyzed implications of land-cover patterns for vulnerability to flooding in the Poyang Lake Region. Land-cover and change were mapped using multitemporal Landsat TM/ETM+ images at high and low water levels from 1987, 1993, 1999, and 2004. Vulnerability to flooding was analyzed based on the distribution of land covers relative to elevation and the levee quality. Results showed that patterns of Farmland, Urban, and Wetland covers varied by elevation, by the relative likelihood of flooding within polders, and over time; the general trend, with some notable exceptions, was toward less vulnerability of farmland and urban areas to flooding. Factors of markets, laws and regulations have likely influenced changes in landcover patterns and, therefore, in vulnerability.

                The twentieth century saw fundamental shifts in northern Eurasian political and land-management paradigms, in Russia culminating in the political transition of 1991. We used the 1972 to 2001 Landsat archive bracketing this transition to observe change trends in southern central Siberian Russia in primarily forested study sites. Landsat resolved conifer, mixed, deciduous and young forest; cuts, burns, and insect disturbance; and wetland, agriculture, bare, urban, and water land covers. Over 70 percent of forest area in the three study sites was likely disturbed prior to 1974. Conifer forest decreased over the 1974 to 2001 study period, with the greatest decrease 1974 to 1990. Logging activity (primarily in conifers) declined more during the 1991 to 2001 post-Soviet period. The area of Young forest increased more during the 1974 to 1990 time period. Deciduous forest increased over both time periods. Agriculture declined over both time periods contributing to forest regrowth in this region.
