                The main objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of deriving a land-cover map of the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, for the year 2000, using data from the 1 km SPOT-4 VEGETATION (VGT) sensor. For this purpose we used a VGT temporal series of 12 monthly composite images, which were further transformed to physical-meaningful fraction images of vegetation, soil, and shade. Classification of fraction images was implemented using several recent machine learning developments, namely, filtering input training data and probability bagging in a classification tree approach.A 10-fold cross validation accuracy assessment indicates that filtering and probability bagging are effective at increasing overall and class-specific accuracy. Overall accuracy and mean probability of class membership were 0.88 and 0.80, respectively. The map of probability of class membership indicates that the larger errors are associated withcerradosavanna and semi-deciduous forest.

                This research investigates the relationship between socioeconomic status and remotely sensed vegetation intensity in residential land in the Denver, Colorado metropolitan area. Land-cover data derived from aerial photography and nor-malized difference vegetation index data (NDVI) derived from Landsat ETM= imagery were integrated with U.S. Bureau of the Census tract-level data and analyzed using choropleth mapping and multivariate statistics. Association rule mining, a data mining technique, is used to explore nonlinear relationships among variables. Results indicate that higher vegetation intensity is associated with socioeconomic advantage in both sparsely populated, large lot suburban developments, as well as in older, urban neighborhoods. This pattern likely reflects residents’ ability to pay for the cost of maintaining high vegetation intensity, suburban lawn ecosystem vegetation in a semi-arid grassland environment. Additionally, residential choices may be limited by a home price structure that is closely related to the concentration of vegetation in the residential landscaping.

            Isolating Individual Trees in a Savanna Woodland Using Small Footprint Lidar Data

                This study presents a new method of detecting individual treetops from lidar data and applies marker-controlled watershed segmentation into isolating individual trees in savanna woodland. The treetops were detected by searching local maxima in a canopy maxima model (CMM) with variable window sizes. Different from previous methods, the variable windows sizes were determined by the lower-limit of the prediction intervals of the regression curve between crown size and tree height. The canopy maxima model was created to reduce the commission errors of treetop detection. Treetops were also detected based on the fact that they are typically located around the center of crowns. The tree delineation accuracy was evaluated by a five-fold, cross-validation method. Results showed that the absolute accuracy of tree isolation was 64.1 percent, which was much higher than the accuracy of the method, which only searched local maxima within window sizes determined by the regression curve (37.0 percent).

            Error Assessment in Two Lidar-derived TIN Datasets

                An accuracy assessment of two lidar-derived elevation datasets was conducted in areas of rugged terrain (average slope 26.6°). Data from 906 ground checkpoints in various land-cover types were collected in situ as reference points. Analysis of the accuracy of lidar-derived elevation as a function of several factors including terrain slope, terrain aspect, and land-cover types was conducted. This paper attempts to characterize vegetation information derived from lidar data based on variables such as canopy volume, local roughness of point clouds, point spacing of lidar ground returns, and vegetation angle. This information was used to evaluate the accuracy of elevation as a function of vegetation type. The experimental results revealed that the accuracy of elevation was considerably correlated with five factors: terrain slope, vegetation angle, canopy volume, local roughness of point clouds, and point spacing of lidar ground returns. The results show a linear relationship between the elevation accuracy and the combination of vegetation angle and the point spacing of ground returns (r2=0.9). The combination of vegetation angle and point spacing of ground returns explains a significant amount of the variability in elevation accuracy. Elevation accuracy varied with different vegetation types. The elevation accuracy was also linearly correlated with the product of the point spacing of ground returns and the tangent of the slope (r2=0.9). A greater product value implies a greater elevation error. In addition, with regard to terrain aspect, one dense dataset with extra cross-flight data revealed a lesser impact of aspect on elevation accuracy.

                USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) forest area estimates were derived from 4 Landsat ETM=images in Virginia and Minnesota classified using an automated hybrid classifier known as Iterative Guided Spectral Class Rejection (IGSCR). Training data were collected using region-growing initiated at random points within each image. The classified images were spatially post-processed using five different techniques. Image accuracy was assessed using the center land-use of all available FIA plots and subsets containing plots with 50, 75 and 100 percent homogeneity.Overall accuracy (81.9 to 95.4 percent) increased with homogeneity of validation plots and decreased with fragmentation (estimated by percent edge; r2= 0.932). Filtering effects were not consistently significant at the 95 percent level; however, the 3×3 majority filter significantly improved the accuracy of the most fragmented image. The now-automated IGSCR is a suitable candidate for operational forest area estimation, with strong potential for use in other application areas.

            Accuracy Assessment of Lidar Saltmarsh Topographic Data Using RTK GPS

                An evaluation was completed to compare the accuracy of lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) against a statistically representative array of Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS data in a low gradient, vegetated Southeastern U.S. salt marsh. In order to discern potential bias, analyses were carried out separately on the platform-only data, the creek-only data and then the combined datasets. Lidar data were found to overestimate the RTK GPS topographic data by an overall average of only 7 cm. Additionally, these data showed little effect from the dominant macrophyte vegetation within the lidar footprint. From this evaluation, 7 cm appears to be an appropriate vertical adjustment factor for using lidar data in low gradient salt marshes. However, local ground control will continue to be crucial in studies of intertidal environments incorporating airborne laser data collection.
