                The multi-scale framework of the wavelet transform is used to represent the edge information for the retrieval of traditional industrial complexes from digital aerial photographs in an urban area. A set of retrieval parameters is used to extract and enhance the edge information for the target objects. These parameters include summary statistical indices for the detail sub-images of the wavelet transform, an edge-pixel index, weighting schemes for these indices, the level of the wavelet transform, and the search window size. All of these retrieval parameters are effective, except for the weighting schemes, in retrieving the target objects. As a result, a majority of retrieval rates reach 60 percent to 90 percent.

                Recent high-resolution satellite images provide a valuable new data source for geospatial information acquisition. This paper addresses building extraction from Ikonos images in urban areas. The proposed approach uses the classification results of Ikonos multispectral images to provide approximate location and shape for candidate building objects. Their fine extraction is then carried out in the corresponding panchromatic image through segmentation and squaring. The ECHO classifier is used for supervised classification while the ISODATA algorithm is used for unsupervised classification and subsequent image segmentation. The classification performance is evaluated using the classification confusion matrix, while the final building extraction results are assessed based on the manually delineated results. A building squaring approach based on the Hough transformation is developed that detects and forms the rectilinear building boundaries. A number of sample results are presented to illustrate the approach and demonstrate its efficiency. It is shown that about 64.4 percent of the buildings can be detected, extracted, and accurately formed through this process. Remaining difficulties are high percentage false alarm errors caused by the misclassification of road and building classes as well as occlusion and shadows that may mislead the extraction process.

                A complexity reduction in monocular building extraction from aerial imagery may be achieved by decomposing the extraction problem into three sequential steps. This paper focuses on the first of these steps, the selection process, during which an image subset likely to contain a single building is extracted. One of the means to realize this is by pose clustering. Based on vote accumulation, pose clustering can offer some advantages, such as reduced complexity and a false alarm rate prediction capability. This paper describes a voting scheme for right-angle flat-roof buildings, from which image space building location hypotheses (ISBLHs)may be efficiently generated for regularized urban areas. The proposed scheme incorporates weights, constraints, and uncertainties that should be implemented due to the nature of aerial imagery. Additionally, based on an occupancy model, a random vote accumulation and threshold analysis of the proposed voting scheme is presented. This scheme was tested on both simulated and real imagery, and the obtained results are discussed and analyzed.

                Building extraction based on pre-established models has been recognized as a promising idea for acquiring 3D data for buildings from aerial images. This paper proposes a novel building extraction method developed from the concept of fitting CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) primitives to aerial images. To be practicable, this method adopts a semiautomatic procedure, carrying out high-level tasks (building detection, model selection, and attribution) interactively by the operator and performing optimal model-image fitting automatically with a least-squares fitting algorithm. Buildings, represented by CSG models, can be reconstructed part by part after fitting each parameterized CSG primitive to the edge pixels of aerial images. Reconstructed building parts can then be combined using CSG Boolean set operators. Consequently, a building is represented by a CSG tree in which each node links two branches of combined parts. This paper demonstrates ten examples of building extraction from aerial photos taken at a scale of 1:5,000 and scanned at a pixel size of 25 µm. All of the tests were performed in the prototypal system implemented in a CAD-based environment cooperated with a number of specially designed programs. The process time for each primitive is about 20 seconds and the successful rate of model-image fitting was about 90 percent. Evaluated with some check points, the fitting accuracy was about 0.3 m horizontally and 1 m vertically. The test results are encouraging and promote the theory of model-based building extraction.

                This paper presents a novel method for semi-automatically constructing building models from photogrammetric 3D line segments of buildings, i.e., their roof edges. The method, which we call “Split-Merge-Shape” (SMS), can treat both complete line segments as well as incomplete line segments due to image occlusions. The proposed method is comprised of five major parts: (1) the creation of the Region of Interest (ROI) and preprocessing, (2) splitting the model by using the 3D line segments to construct a combination of roof primitives, (3)merging connected roof primitives to complete the boundary of each building, (4) shaping each building rooftop by connected coplanar analysis and coplanar fitting, and (5) quality assurance. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can soundly rebuild the topology from the 3D line segments and reconstruct building models with up to a 98 percent success rate. The proposed SMS method has been proved reliable and effective, with a high degree of automation, even when groups of connected buildings or complex types of buildings are processed.

            Automatic Matching and Three-Dimensional Reconstruction of Free-Form Linear Features from Stereo Images

                Automatic matching of free-formlinear features in overlapping large-scale imagery over urban areas still remains to be a problem in both the photogrammetric and computer vision communities. Although there is a variety of algorithms that have been developed to solve this problem, reliable results are not always guaranteed. Differences in illumination conditions, relief displacement, and occlusions are some of the factors that make solving the matching problem more challenging. The deficiency of available techniques stems from the fact that they do not consider the perspective geometry of the imaging system in the matching process. Moreover, it is usually assumed that conjugate entities are almost exact copies of each other (this is rarely the case). The need for a reliable algorithm that can handle large-scale imagery over urban areas is growing, especially with the increasing availability of high-resolution aerial imagery. In this research, a new approach for automatic matching and three-dimensional reconstruction of free-form linear features from stereo images is proposed. The suggested strategy is based on The Modified Iterated Hough Transform (MIHT) for Robust Parameter Estimation. MIHT relies on the mathematical relationship between conjugate entities (the coplanarity condition when dealing with a stereo pair). As a result, it overcomes problems arising from relief displacements and/or occlusions. Moreover, MIHT simultaneously solves for the relative orientation parameters as well as the correspondence between conjugate entities in a stereo pair. Matching ambiguities along and across conjugate epipolar lines are observed in the correspondence output from MIHT. Ambiguities along the epipolar lines stem from the nature of the coplanarity model, which establishes the correspondence between conjugate epipolar lines rather than conjugate points. On the other hand, ambiguities across the epipolar lines are expected due to the discrete cell size of the implemented accumulator array in MIHT. In this work, the ambiguities are resolved through several pruning techniques such as correlation coefficient, edge connectivity, height information, and epipolar geometry. Conjugate entities with sub-pixel accuracy are finally used to reconstruct accurate and reliable three-dimensional image-space discontinuities. Various experiments using large-scale imagery over urban areas proved the reliability and robustness of the proposed method.

The process time for each primitive is about 20 seconds and the successful rate of model-image fitting was about 90 percent. Evaluated with some check points, the fitting accuracy was about 0.3 m horizontally and 1 m vertically. The test results are encouraging and promote the theory of model-based building extraction.

                This paper presents a novel method for semi-automatically constructing building models from photogrammetric 3D line segments of buildings, i.e., their roof edges. The method, which we call “Split-Merge-Shape” (SMS), can treat both complete line segments as well as incomplete line segments due to image occlusions. The proposed method is comprised of five major parts: (1) the creation of the Region of Interest (ROI) and preprocessing, (2) splitting the model by using the 3D line segments to construct a combination of roof primitives, (3)merging connected roof primitives to complete the boundary of each building, (4) shaping each building rooftop by connected coplanar analysis and coplanar fitting, and (5) quality assurance. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can soundly rebuild the topology from the 3D line segments and reconstruct building models with up to a 98 percent success rate. The proposed SMS method has been proved reliable and effective, with a high degree of automation, even when groups of connected buildings or complex types of buildings are processed.

                Automatic matching of free-formlinear features in overlapping large-scale imagery over urban areas still remains to be a problem in both the photogrammetric and computer vision communities. Although there is a variety of algorithms that have been developed to solve this problem, reliable results are not always guaranteed. Differences in illumination conditions, relief displacement, and occlusions are some of the factors that make solving the matching problem more challenging. The deficiency of available techniques stems from the fact that they do not consider the perspective geometry of the imaging system in the matching process. Moreover, it is usually assumed that conjugate entities are almost exact copies of each other (this is rarely the case). The need for a reliable algorithm that can handle large-scale imagery over urban areas is growing, especially with the increasing availability of high-resolution aerial imagery. In this research, a new approach for automatic matching and three-dimensional reconstruction of free-form linear features from stereo images is proposed. The suggested strategy is based on The Modified Iterated Hough Transform (MIHT) for Robust Parameter Estimation. MIHT relies on the mathematical relationship between conjugate entities (the coplanarity condition when dealing with a stereo pair). As a result, it overcomes problems arising from relief displacements and/or occlusions. Moreover, MIHT simultaneously solves for the relative orientation parameters as well as the correspondence between conjugate entities in a stereo pair. Matching ambiguities along and across conjugate epipolar lines are observed in the correspondence output from MIHT. Ambiguities along the epipolar lines stem from the nature of the coplanarity model, which establishes the correspondence between conjugate epipolar lines rather than conjugate points. On the other hand, ambiguities across the epipolar lines are expected due to the discrete cell size of the implemented accumulator array in MIHT. In this work, the ambiguities are resolved through several pruning techniques such as correlation coefficient, edge connectivity, height information, and epipolar geometry. Conjugate entities with sub-pixel accuracy are finally used to reconstruct accurate and reliable three-dimensional image-space discontinuities. Various experiments using large-scale imagery over urban areas proved the reliability and robustness of the proposed method.
