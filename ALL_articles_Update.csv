Transmission corridors located in high mountains and valleys are often threatened by geological disasters, which seriously affect their stable operation. This research investigates the landslide in the Kunming transmission corridor using 79 Sentinel-1A SAR images from July 2020 to October 2021. Using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) methods, deformation changes before the landslide are analyzed. Factors like precipitation, lithology, and vegetation coverage demonstrate a correlation with landslide occurrence. Seasonal variations in deformation were related to precipitation. The landslide's primary causes are attributed to precipitation, carbonate karstification, and vegetation coverage. Ultimately, this research establishes a correlation between deformation changes and influencing factors in the Kunming transmission corridor, contributing to a deeper understanding of landslide evolution and ensuring the corridor's security for sustainable electricity supply and economic development."
Adaptive Orientation Object-Detection Method for Large-scale Remote Sensing Images Based on Multi-scale Block Fusion,"Wang, Yanli; Dong, Zhipeng; Wang, Mi; Ding, Yi",pp. 27-34(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000001/art00012;jsessionid=7gkk40y09bk8.x-ic-live-02,"Object detection is crucial to extracting and analyzing information autonomously from high-resolution remote sensing images (HRSIs). To address ideal blocking for large-scale  HRSI object detection, this study uses a novel adaptive orientation object-detection method for largescale HRSIs based on multi-scale block fusion. An adaptive orientation object-detection  framework based on a convolutional neural network is applied to detect diverse objects of large-scale HRSIs through different block scales; average precision (AP) values of diverse object  detection results are calculated at different block scales. Then, block scales matching the largest AP values of diverse objects are determined based on statistical results of the AP  values of the diverse object at different block scales. Finally, object-detection results at block scales matching the largest AP values of diverse objects are fused by the non-maximum  suppression algorithm to achieve large-scale HRSI object-detection results. Experimental findings reveal that the proposed method is better than any single block-scale object-detection  method, resulting in satisfactory large-scale HRSI object-detection results."

Model  pruning and knowledge distillation have been widely used for reducing the complexity and storage cost of neural networks. This study designs the Remote Sensing Object Detection Network  (RSODNet), a lightweight model for remote sensing image object detection, and proposes bridging cross-task distillation network slimming (BCDNS) as a method that integrates model pruning and  knowledge distillation. The experiment results indicate that RSODNet outperforms the YOLOv8 model in various metrics while maintaining almost unchanged Params and calculation volume. The  BCDNS method eliminates redundant channels while preserving a priori knowledge of the initial model intact. This study offers technical support for compressed models used in object detection  from remote sensing images"

Monitoring and predicting ground deformation in these areas is essential. This study introduces a CS-Elman prediction model based on SBAS-InSAR monitoring. SBAS-InSAR technology analyzes 36 Sentinel-1A im- ages from Wenchuan County, Sichuan Province, China (June 2021 to October 2023), focusing on deformation areas and precipitation data. The CS algorithm optimizes the Elman network's parameters, using SBAS-InSAR data as training samples. Validation shows that: (1) Wenchuan County experiences varied deformation, with Banzi Gully in Miansi Town showing the highest uplift at 183.74 mm/a due to heavy rain. (2) As sample size increases, prediction error decreases and accuracy improves. Predictions suggest ongo- ing uplift at about 4.50 mm per month above Cutou Gully over the next four months, highlighting the need for continued monitoring."

This study relied on remote sensing data to analyze and assess land use and land cover changes in Babil Province, Iraq, over the past two decades. The study focused on identifying the patterns and factors influencing these changes, using Landsat satellite imagery to create digital maps classifying land into four main categories: urban lands, bare soil lands, water bodies, and vegetation lands. The results showed a noticeable expansion of urban lands at the expense of bare soil lands, primarily attributed to population growth, economic development, and improved security conditions. This study underscores the importance of sustainable land management and urban planning in Babil Province. These results highlight the importance of sustainable land management in Babil Province, including sound urban planning considering urban expansion's environmental, social, and economic effects. The classification was implemented using a maximum likelihood classifier, and the accuracy assessment yielded satisfactory results with an overall accuracy of 93.5517%. This study encourages using artificial intelligence to track and analyze land use changes in Babil."
Image Fusion in Remote Sensing: An Overview and Meta-Analysis,"Albanwan, Hessah; Qin, Rongjun; Tang, Yang",pp. 755-775(21),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2024/00000090/00000012/art00012;jsessionid=9a8ib0ew1wvq.x-ic-live-03,"Remote sensing image fusion is consistently used to turn raw images of different resolutions, sources, and modalities into accurate, complete, and spatiotemporally coherent images. It facilitates downstream applications such as pan sharpening, change detection, and classification. However, image fusion solutions are highly disparate to various remote sensing problems and are often narrowly defined in existing reviews as topical applications (e. g., pan sharpening). Theoretically, image fusion can be applied to any gridded data through pixel-level operations; thus, we expand its scope by comprehensively surveying relevant works. We develop a simple taxonomy for many-to-one and many-to-many image fusion, defining it as a mapping problem turning one or multiple images into another set based on desired coherence. Furthermore, we provide a meta-analysis to cover 10,420 peer-reviewed papers from the 1980s to 2023 studying various types of image fusion and their applications. Finally, we discuss image fusion's benefits and emerging challenges to provide open research directions."
Morphology-Based Feature Extraction Network for Arbitrary-Oriented SAR Vehicle Detection,"Chen, Ting; Huang, Xiaohong",pp. 665-673(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2024/00000090/00000011/art00010;jsessionid=vj4y1qllys3s.x-ic-live-02,"In recent years, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) vehicle detection has become a research hotspot. However, algorithms using horizontal bounding boxes can lead to redundant detection areas due to the varying aspect ratio and arbitrary orientation of vehicle targets. This paper proposes a morphology-based feature extraction network (MFE-Net), which fully uses the prior shape knowledge of the vehicle targets. Specifically, we adopt rotatable bounding boxes to predict the targets, and a novel rectangular rotation-invariant coordinate convolution (RRICC) is proposed to extract the feature, which can determine more accurately the convolutional sampling location of the vehicles. The adaptive thresholding denoising module (ATDM) is designed to suppress background clutter. Furthermore, inspired by the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and self-attention, we propose the hybrid representation enhancement module (HREM) to highlight the vehicle target features. The experiment results show that the proposed model obtains an average precision (AP) of 93.1% on the SAR vehicle detection data set (SVDD)."

This article proposes a spatial-spectral middle cross-attention fusion network to explore the spatial-spectral structure correlation. Initially, we learn spatial and spectral features through spatial and spectral branches instead of single ones to reduce information compression. Then, a novel middle-cross attention fusion block that includes middle features fusion strategy and cross-attention is proposed to fuse spatial-spectral features to enhance their mutual effects, which aims to explore the spatial-spectral structural correlations. Finally, we propose a spectral feature compensation mechanism to provide complementary information for adjacent band groups. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in object values and visual quality."

We investigated two new-generation hyperspectral sensors, Germany’s Deutsches Zentrum für Luft‐ und Raumfahrt Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer (DESIS) and Italy’s PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA), within California???s Central Valley in August 2021 focusing on five irrigated agricultural crops (alfalfa, almonds, corn, grapes, and pistachios). With reference data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Cropland Data Layer, we developed a spectral library of the crops and classified them using three machine learning algorithms (support vector machines [SVM], random forest [RF], and spectral angle mapper [SAM]) and two philosophies: 1. Full spectral analysis (FSA) and 2. Optimal hyperspectral narrowband (OHNB) analysis. For FSA, we used 59 DESIS four-bin product bands and 207 of 238 PRISMA bands. For OHNB analysis, 9 DESIS and 16 PRISMA nonredundant OHNBs for studying crops were selected. FSA achieved only 1% to 3% higher accuracies relative to OHNB analysis in most cases. SVM provided the best results, closely followed by RF. Using both DESIS and PRISMA image OHNBs in SVM for classification led to higher accuracy than using either image alone, with an overall accuracy of 99%, producer’s accuracies of 94% to 100%, and user???s accuracies of 95% to 100%."
A Variable-Iterative Fully Convolutional Neural Network for Sparse Unmixing,"Kong, Fanqiang; Lv, Zhijie; Wang, Kun; Fang, Xu; Zheng, Yuhan; Yu, Shengjie",pp. 699-706(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2024/00000090/00000011/art00014;jsessionid=vj4y1qllys3s.x-ic-live-02,"Neural networks have greatly promoted the development of hyperspectral unmixing (HU). Most data-driven deep networks extract features of hyperspectral images (HSIs) by stacking convolutional layers to achieve endmember extraction and abundance estimation. Some model-driven networks have strong interpretability but fail to mine the deep feature. We propose a variable-iterative fully convolutional neural network (VIFCNN) for sparse unmixing, combining the characteristics of these two networks. Under the model-driven iterative framework guided by sparse unmixing by variable splitting and augmented lagrangian (SUnSAL), a data-driven spatial-spectral feature learning module and a spatial information updating module are introduced to enhance the learning of data information. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets show that VIFCNN significantly outperforms several traditional unmixing methods and two deep learning???based methods. On real datasets, our method improves signal-to-reconstruction error by 17.38%, reduces abundance root-mean-square error by 25.24%, and reduces abundance spectral angle distance by 31.40% compared with U-ADMM-ßUNet."

In this study, we proposed an SAR black-box local adversarial attack algorithm named attention heat map- based black-box local adversarial attack (AH-BLAA). First, we designed an attention heat map extraction module combined with the layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) algorithm to obtain the high concerning areas of the SAR-ATR models. Then, to gener- ate SAR adversarial attack examples, we designed a perturbation generator module, introducing the structural dissimilarity (DSSIM) metric in the loss function to limit image distortion and the dif- ferential evolution (DE) algorithm to search for optimal perturba- tions. Experimental results on the MSTAR and FUSAR-Ship datasets showed that compared with existing adversarial attack algorithms, the attack success rate of the AH-BLAA algorithm increased by 0.63% to 33.59% and 1.05% to 17.65%, respectively. Moreover, the low- est perturbation ratios reached 0.23% and 0.13%, respectively."

Teacher-Student Prototype Enhancement Network for a Few-Shot Remote Sensing Scene Classification,"Zhu, Ye; Yang, Shanying; Yu, Yang",pp. 621-630(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2024/00000090/00000010/art00012;jsessionid=27o0mw2ek145f.x-ic-live-03,"Few-shot remote sensing scene classification identifies new classes from limited labeled samples where the great challenges are intraclass diversity, interclass similarity, and limited supervision. To alleviate these problems, a teacher-student prototype enhancement network is proposed for a few-shot remote sensing scene classification. Instead of introducing an attentional mechanism in mainstream studies, a prototype enhancement module is recommended to adaptively select high-confidence query samples, which can enhance the support prototype representations to emphasize intraclass and interclass relationships. The construction of a few-shot teacher model generates more discriminative predictive representations with inputs from many labeled samples, thus providing a strong supervisory signal to the student model and encouraging the network to achieve accurate classification with a limited number of labeled samples. Extensive experiments of four public datasets, including NWPU-remote sens ing image scene classification (NWPU-RESISC45), aerial image dataset (AID), UC Merced, and WHU-RS19, demonstrate that this method achieves superior competitive performance than the state-of-the-art methods on five-way, one-shot, and five-shot classifications."
Bank Line Extraction by Integration of Orthoimages and Lidar Digital Elevation Model Using Principal Component Analysis and Alpha Matting,"Deshpande, Sagar S.",pp. 631-638(8),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2024/00000090/00000010/art00013;jsessionid=27o0mw2ek145f.x-ic-live-03,"Riverbank lines change over time, causing loss of land and property. Accurate mapping of riverbank lines is essential for restoration and preservation. This paper presents a method to map riverbank lines by combining georeferenced orthoimages and lidar digital elevation model (DEM). This method uses the properties that lidar can provide elevations under trees and open water edges are visible in orthoimages to extract the planimetric locations of bank lines. The orthoimage pixels with less than 0.15% slope on the DEM were replaced by water pixels. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted using DEM, slope, and orthoimage bands. Training data of river body and the background were identified manually on the first three component images. An alpha matting–based method was implemented using the training data to extract the bank lines. Bankline using α value of 50% probability were statistically and visually better when compared to the manual bank lines."

To develop the method, a moving image was captured while the crane was slewed with a monocular camera mounted vertically downward at the tip of the crane. The boom length and angle data were output from a control device, a controller area network. For efficient development, a simulator that imitated the environment of an actual machine was developed and used. The proposed method uses optical flow to track feature points. The classification was performed successfully, independent of derricking motion. Consequently, the proposed method contributes to stable 3D mapping around cranes in construction sites."

In recent years, deep learning–based point cloud semantic segmentation methods have received extensive attention from researchers. Multi-scale neighborhood feature learning methods are suitable for inhomogeneous density point clouds, but different scale branching feature learning increases the computational complexity and makes it difficult to accurately fuse different scale features to express local information. In this study, a point cloud semantic segmentation network based on RandLA-Net with multi-scale local feature aggregation and adaptive fusion is proposed. The designed structure can reduce computational complexity and accurately express local features. The mean intersection-over-union is improved by 1.1% on the SemanticKITTI data set with an inference speed of nine frames per second, while the mean intersection-over-union is improved by 0.9% on the S3DIS data set, compared with RandLA-Net. We also conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the proposed key structure."

Then the training set is generated based on EFB-RF. Finally, the remaining stars are identified using a residual star matching method. The simulation experiment and results show that the identification rate of our algorithm can reach 99.82% under 1 pixel position noise, and it can reach 99.54% under 5% false stars. When the percentage of missing stars is 15%, it can reach 99.40%. The algorithm is verified by RSO surveillance."

It is well known and mathematically proven that additional parameters (APs) can compensate image distortions and remaining error sources by a rigorous photogrammetric bundle-block adjustment. Thus, kernel functions based on orthogonal wavelets (e. g., asymmetric Daubechies wave- lets, least asymmetric Daubechies wavelets, Battle-Lemarié wavelets, Meyer wavelets) are used to build the wavelets-based family of APs for self-calibrating digital frame cameras. These new APs are called wavelet APs. Its applications in rigorous tests are accomplished by using aerial images taken by an airborne digital mapping camera in situ and practical calibrations. The test results demonstrate that these orthogonal wavelet APs are applicable and largely avoid the risk of over-parameterization. Their external accuracy is evaluated using reliable and high precision check points in the calibration field."

Many researchers have developed spectrum libraries based on the actual aging of asphalt pavements, and it is possible to construct pavement health indices based on spectrum changes. Some indexes can extract different aging degrees of asphalt pavement from optical satellite images. Of course, current research can only preliminarily reflect the aging phenomenon of asphalt pavement and cannot accurately describe the distress characteristics of asphalt pavement.

In this study, a method for detecting building shadows in GF‐2 images based on improved quick shift was proposed. First, six feature variables were constructed: first principal component (PC1), brightness component (I), normalized difference shadow index (NDSI), morphological shadow index (MSI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Then, the image was segmented to obtain homogeneous objects, which were then classified using a random forest model. Two improvements were added to the quick shift algorithm: using PC1, I, and MSI as input data instead of RGB images; and adding Canny edge constraints. Validation in six research areas yields Kappa coefficients of 0.928, 0.896, 0.89, 0.913, 0.879, and 0.909, confirming method feasibility. In addition, comparative experiments demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness across different land cover types while mitigating the segmentation scale effect."

Diverse geological processes generate irregular alteration patterns with diverse spectral characteristics in mineral deposits. Applying remotely sensed hyperspectral images (HSIs) is an appealing technology for geologic surveyors to generate alteration maps. Conventional methods mainly use shallow spectral absorption features to discriminate minerals and cannot extract their important spectral information. Deep neural networks with nonlinear layers can evoke the deep spectral and spatial information of HSIs. Deep learning???based methods include fully connected neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and hybrid convolutional networks like mixed convolution neural network and covariance pooling (MCNN‐CP) algorithms. However, each has its advantages and limitations. To significantly avoid losing important spectral features, we proposed a new method by fusing a one‐dimensional convolutional neural network (1D‐CNN) with MCNN‐CP (1D‐MCNN‐CP), achieving an overall accuracy (97.44%) of mineral mapping from PRISMA HSIs. This research deduced that 1D‐MCNN‐CP improved performance and reduced misclassification errors among minerals sharing similar spectral features."

Multispectral images have high spatial resolution but low spectral resolution. Hyperspectral images have high spectral resolution but low spatial resolution. This study proposes a residual learning and attention-based parallel network based on residual network and channel attention. The network performs image fusion of a high spatial resolution multispectral image and a low spatial resolution hyperspectral image. The network training and fusion experiments are conducted on four public benchmark data sets to show the effectiveness of the proposed model. The fusion performance is compared with classical signal processing???based image fusion techniques. Four image metrics are used for the quantitative evaluation of the fused images. The proposed network improved fusion ability by reducing the root mean square error and relative dimensionless global error in synthesis and increased the peak signal-to-noise ratio when compared to other state-of-the-art models.

Within-season predictions for 2018–2022 were then made to evaluate the perfor- mance of the proposed system by comparing it with the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) monthly forecasts and the fixed statistical data. The absolute percentage errors of the proposed system for predicting national-level yield and production were less than 5% for all simulation years as of day of year (DOY) 279. The prediction accuracy as of DOY 247 and DOY 279 were comparable to the USDA's forecasts. The proposed system would enable us to make a comprehensive understanding about overview of US corn and soybean crop condition by visualizing detail spatial pattern of good- or poor harvest regions on a within-season basis."

However, the current few-shot learning approaches still suffer from overfitting due to the scarcity of labeled samples. To this end, a few-shot semi-supervised method is proposed to address this issue. Specifically, semi-supervised learning method is used to increase target domain samples; then we train multiple classification models using the augmented samples. Finally, we perform decision fusion of the results obtained from the multiple models to accomplish the image classification task. According to the experiments conducted on two real few-shot remote sensing scene datasets, our proposed method achieves significantly higher accuracy (approximately 1.70% to 4.33%) compared to existing counterparts."

However, in some applications, dense point cloud has no practical meaning. How to effectively sample from the dense points and maximize the preservation of terrain features is extremely important. This paper will propose a DEM sampling algorithm that utilizes terrain complexity and maximal Poisson-disk sampling to extract key feature points for adaptive DEM sampling. The algorithm estimates terrain complexity based on local terrain variation and prioritizes points with high complexity for sampling. The sampling radius is inversely proportional to terrain complexity, while ensuring that points within the radius of accepted samples are not considered new samples. This way makes more points of concern in the rugged regions. The results show that the proposed algorithm has higher global accuracy than the classic six sampling methods."
I2-FaçadeNet: An Illumination-invariant Façade Recognition Network Leveraging Sparsely Gated Mixture of Multi-color Space Experts for Aerial Oblique Imagery,"Huang, Shengzhi; Hu, Han; Zhu, Qing",pp. 21-31(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2024/00000090/00000001/art00008;jsessionid=37qh3q627goe5.x-ic-live-01,"Façade image recognition under complex illumination conditions is crucial for various applications, including urban three-dimensional modeling and building identification. Existing methods relying solely on Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images are prone to texture ambiguity in complex illumination environments. Furthermore, façades display varying orientations and camera viewing angles, resulting in performance issues within the RGB color space. In this study, we introduce an illumination-invariant façade recognition network (I2-FaçadeNet) that leverages sparsely gated multi-color space experts for enhanced façade image recognition in challenging illumination environments. First, RGB façade images are converted into multi-color spaces to eliminate the ambiguous texture in complex illumination. Second, we train expert networks using separate channels of multi-color spaces. Finally, a sparsely gated mechanism is introduced to manage the expert networks, enabling dynamic activation of expert networks and the merging of results. Experimental evaluations leveraging both the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing benchmark data sets and the Shenzhen data sets reveal that our proposed I2-FaçadeNet surpasses various depths of ResNet in façade recognition under complex illumination conditions. Specifically, the classification accuracy for poorly illuminated façades in Zurich improves by nearly 8%, while the accuracy for over-illuminated areas in Shenzhen increases by approximately 3%. Moreover, ablation studies conducted on façade images with complex illumination indicate that compared to traditional RGB-based ResNet, the proposed network achieves an accuracy improvement of 3% to 4% up to 100% for overexposed images and an accuracy improvement of 3% to 10% for underexposed images."

These methods are all based on relatively balanced data sets. However, in real-world scenarios, many data sets belong to the long-tailed distribution, resulting in poor performance. In view of the good performance of contrastive learning in long-tailed image classification, a new dual-branch fusion learning classification model is proposed to fuse the discriminative features of remote sensing images with spatial data, making full use of valuable image representation information in imbalance data. This paper also presents a hybrid loss, which solves the problem of poor discrimination of extracted features caused by large intra-class variation and inter-class ambiguity. Extended experiments on three long-tailed remote sensing image classification data sets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed dual-branch model based on contrastive learning in long-tailed image classification."

The data of a digitally documented cultural heritage building offers significant advantages as it is accessible and modifiable by all professionals involved in the same or different projects. The most important factor affecting the accuracy and precision of the HBIM model is the ability to collect complete and accurate information about the physical structure. Combining terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry point clouds is one of the most efficient ways to capture accurate digital data on the building. This study provides the foundation for creating an HBIM model for cultural heritage the coupling of spatial data with TLS and UAV. This paper aims to generate synergy between TLS and UAV point cloud data and ensure that the spatial database contains sufficient data to model historical objects with HBIM tendencies.

Using a field campaign, remotely sensed imagery, socioeconomic data, and meteorological parameters, we developed a framework based on the Carnegie‐Ames‐Stanford Approach (CASA) model, correlation technique, trend analysis, and landscape metrics to measure spatiotemporal changes in NPP and NEP from 2001 to 2018. The derived changes were then linked to regional multiple factors including climate, landscape factors, human activity, and land use change. The results of the research can provide a scientific basis for vegetation evaluation, ecosystem assessment, and other aspects of the region."

Fast-growing tropical cities particularly call for an understanding of this phenomenon, known as the urban heat island (UHI). The present study was conducted to detect UHI dynamics over the National Capital Region of India. Stretching over more than 32 000 km2, this region consists of urban centers of varying sizes. Landsat thermal bands were processed to extract temperature patterns between 1999 and 2019. Urban climate change was prominent, as a 2349-km2expansion in UHI area was spotted. Urban clusters of different sizes were demarcated by applying the k-nearest neighbor algorithm on the normalized difference building index maps. This empirical analysis helped to form a logarithmic relation between city size and UHI intensity. Observed results set a framework to assess the thermal environment of numerous urban centers from any tropical country. UHI intensity values for various city sizes were computed, as they were crucial to decide the outdoor comfort zones based on the base temperature conditions of other cities. Further, the critical zones in each urban cluster were identified using the vegetation index, and scopes of landscaping were suggested based on the observed building morphologies of different local climate zones."

However, the complexity of background information in smoke images often results in deep learning models losing crucial details while capturing smoke image features. To address this, we present a detection algorithm called Multichannel Smoke YOLOv5s (MCSYOLOv5s). This algorithm comprises a smoke flame detection module, multichannel YOLOv5s (MC‐YOLOv5s), and a smoke cloud classification module, Smoke Classification Network (SCN). MC‐YOLOv5s uses a generative confrontation structure to design a dual‐channel feature extraction network and adopts a new feature cross-fusion mechanism to enhance the smoke feature extraction ability of classic YOLOv5s. The SCN module combines Weather Research and Forecasting numerical forecast results to classify smoke and clouds to reduce false positives caused by clouds. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed forest fire monitoring method, MCS‐YOLOv5s, achieves higher detection accuracy of 95.17%, surpassing all comparative algorithms. Moreover, it effectively reduces false alarms caused by clouds."

In 2022, the Forest And Buildings removed Copernicus digital elevation model (FABDEM) was released, in which trees and buildings were removed at a 30 m resolution. Therefore, it was necessary to make a comprehensive evaluation of this model. This research aims to perform a qualitative and quantitative analysis of fabdem in comparison with the commonly used global dems. We investigated the effect of the terrain slope, aspect, roughness, and land cover types in causing errors in the topographic representation of all dems. The fabdem had the highest overall vertical accuracy of 5.56 m. It was the best dem in representing the terrain roughness. The fabdem and Copernicus dem were equally influenced by the slopes more than the other models and had the worst accuracy of slope representation. In the tree, built, and flooded vegetation areas of the fabdem, the mean errors in elevation have been reduced by approximately 3.34 m, 1.26 m and 1.55 m, respectively. Based on Welch's t-test, there was no significant difference between fabdem and Copernicus dem elevations. However, the slight improvements in the fabdem make it the best filtered dem to represent the terrain heights over different land cover types."

Based on the intersections between each ray and the reconstructed surface, our metrics allow evaluating both the global coherency of the reconstruction and the accuracy at close range. We validate this evaluation protocol by surveying several open-source algorithms as well as a piece of licensed software on three data sets. The results confirm the relevance of assessi ng local and global accuracy separately since algorithms sometimes fail at guaranteeing both simultaneously. In addition, algorithms making use of sensor positions perform better than the ones relying only on points and normals, indicating a potentially significant added value of this piece of information.

Here, we used remote sensing data to quantitatively assess the relationship of vegetation SOS to UI gradients at mid-high latitudes in the northern hemisphere. The results showed that urban area vegetation SOS widely presented earlier than for rural area vegetation. Across the cities we investigated the extent UI gradient was prevalent as a threshold (33.2% ± 2.3%) of surface temperature to SOS advance enhancement and offset. At low urbanization enhanced surface temperature on sos advances, while at high urbanization offset surface temperature on SOS advances. Overall, UI demonstrated a nonlinear relationship with sos. The results of this study suggest that there may be thresholds of impact on vegetation SOS in future global climate and environment change processes, where opposite effects can occur below and above thresholds."

After thinning edges obtained by the CFAR detector, the hysteresis thresholding is employed to reduce edge streaking, which is caused by abundant speckles. A ratio of the high to the low threshold Pfain the hysteresis thresholding is pointed out for linking edges.

The approach was applied in central Texas, USA, covering over 6000 km2. We generated 36 variables for each object and accounted for spatial structures of sample data to determine the distance at which samples were spatially independent. The final rf model produced 94.8% accuracy on independent stratified random samples.

Over the past decade, the availability of near- shore bathymetric data has increased dramatically due to advances in satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB). One notable advance occurred with the 2018 launch of NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2), carrying the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS). However, much like other Earth observing satellites, ATLAS is often hampered by obstructions, such as clouds, which block the sensor's view of the Earth's surface. In this study, we introduce the Deep Occlusion Recovery of Satellite Lidar From ICESat-2 Network (DORSL-FIN) to recover partially occluded bathymetric profiles. We show that DORSL-FIN is able to accurately recover occluded bathymetry and outperforms other methods of interpolation."

With respect to the problem of fake edges in image edge detection caused by image noise and the phenomenon of the same class objects reflecting different spectra, this article proposes a novel edge detection method for HSRIs by combin- ing superpixels with dual-threshold edge tracking. First, the image is smoothed using the simple linear iterative clustering algorithm to eliminate the influence of image noise and the phenomenon of the same class objects reflecting different spectra on image edge detec - tion. Second, initial edge detection results of the image are obtained using the dual-threshold edge tracking algorithm. Finally, the initial image edge detection results are post-processed by removing the burrs and extracting skeleton lines to obtain accurate edge detection results. The experimental results confirm that the proposed method outperforms the others and can obtain smooth, continuous, and single-pixel response edge detection results for HSRIs ."

Rapid urbanization and population expansion have increased Lahore's urban impervious surface area. This research is based on estimating the urban imper- vious surface area ( uisa ) growth from 1993 to 2022. Therefore, we aimed to generate an accurate urban impervious surfaces area map based on Landsat time series data on Google Earth Engine ( gee ). We have used a novel global impervious surface area index ( gisai ) for impervious surface area ( uisa ) extraction. The gisai accomplished significant results, with an average overall accuracy of 90.93% and an average kappa coefficient of 0.78. We also compared the results of gisai with Global Human Settlement Layer-Built and harmonized nighttime light ( ntl ) isa data products. The accuracy assessment and cross-validation of uisa results were performed using ground truth data on ArcGIS and gee. Our research findings revealed that the spatial extent of uisa increased by 198.69 km2from 1993 to 2022 in Lahore. Additionally, the uisa has increased at an average growth rate of 39.74 km2. The gisai index was highly accurate at extract- ing uisa and can be used for other cities to map impervious surface area growth. This research can help urban planners and policymak- ers to delineate urban development boundaries. Also, there should be controlled urban expansion policies for sustainable metropolis and should use less impermeable materials for future city developments."

The results showed that the values of Precision, Recall, mean Average Precision (mAP)@0.5, and[email protected]:0.95 of the model increased 7.3%, 0.7%, 1%, and 7.2%, respectively on the Common Objects in Context data set in the detection stage; the four values increased 3.1%, 2.2%, 1.3%, and 5.7%, respectively on the custom remote sensing image data set in the verification stage.

Compared with the other papers, the improved model in this paper proved to be better. Artificial poverty alleviation can be replaced by remote sensing image processing because it is inexpensive, efficient, accurate, objective, does not require data, and has the same evaluation effect. The proposed model can be considered as a promising approach in the assessment of regional poverty."

However, dl is a computationally demanding algorithm with many parameters and a high computational burden, which seriously restricts the deployment ofdl-basedhsiclassification algorithms on mobile and embedded systems. In this paper, we propose an extremely lightweight conditional three-dimensional (3D) hsi with a double-branch structure to solve these problems. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight conditional 3D convolution to replace the conventional 3D convolution to reduce the computational and memory cost of the network and achieve flexiblehsifeature extraction. Then, based on lightweight conditional 3D convolution, we build two parallel paths to independently exploit and optimize the diverse spatial and spectral features. Furthermore, to precisely locate the key information, which is conducive to classification, a lightweight attention mechanism is carefully designed to refine extracted spatial and spectral features, and improve the classification accuracy with less computation and memory costs. Experiments on three publichsidata sets show that the proposed model can effectively reduce the cost of computation and memory, achieve high execution speed, and better classification performance compared with several recent dl-based models."

The surface reflectance for AOD retrieval was estimated from the image that had minimal aerosol contamination in a temporal window determined by AERONET data. Validation of the Sentinel-2 AOD retrievals was conducted against four Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET ) sites located in Beijing. The results show that the Sentinel-2 AOD retrievals are highly consistent with the AERONET AOD measurements (R = 0.942), with 85.56% falling within the expected error. The mean absolute error and the root-mean-square error are 0.0688 and 0.0882, respectively. In addition, the AOD distribution map obtained by this algorithm well reflects the fine-spatial-resolution changes in AOD distribution. These results suggest that the improved high-resolution AOD retrieval algorithm is robust and has the potential advantage of retrieving high-resolution AOD over urban areas."

Therefore, this paper proposes a novel method for SAR image change detection based on clustering fusion and deep neural networks. We first used hierarchical fuzzy c-means clustering (HFCM ) to process two different images to obtain HFCM classification results. Then a fusion strategy is designed to obtain the fused image from the two HFCM classified images as the pre-classification result. Furthermore, a lightweight deep neural network com posed of a decomposition convolution module and an auxiliary classification module was proposed; the former module could reduce network parameters by 28%, and the latter could reduce network parameters by 33.3%. To improve the recognition performance of the network, the classification layer was replaced by the regression layer at the outcome of the network. By comparing the experiments of different methods on five data sets, the performance of our proposed method is superior."

In this study, four experimental strategies were designed for comparison based on TanDEM-X polarized interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PolInSAR) data, TanDEM-DEM, and 42 field-measured data. Our results show that in the RVoG model, (1) a reference ground phase to select the volume scattering complex coherence provides greater accuracy in determining forest height, (2) forest height estimation can be achieved by directly using DEM as ground phase information without relying on model solving and obtaining a more accurate forest height than TanDEM-X alone, and (3) the highest estimation accuracy is obtained by using DEM as coherence information among all schemes. Although the difference in forest height estimation results is not significant in this study, it still proves that the forest height estimation strategy of high-precision DEM combined with short-wavelength PolInSAR can not only improve the forest height estimation accuracy but also simplify the solving process of the RVoG model, which is an important reference for global forest parameter estimation and ecosystem detection based on spaceborne PolInSAR."

To create a Digital Surface Model (DSM ) of three important rice breeding stages, an efficient and fast (compared to manual monitoring) Unoccupied Aerial System was used to collect data. Outliers emerge in DSM as a result of the influence of environ- ment and equipment, and the outliers related to rice not only affect the extraction of rice growth changes but are also more challenging to remove. Therefore, after using ground control points uniform geodetic level for filtering, statistical outlier removal (SOR ) and quadratic surface filtering (QSF ) are used. After that, differential operations are applied to the DSM to create a differential digital surface model that can account for the change in rice plant height. Comparing the prediction accuracy before and after filtering: R2= 0.72, RMSE = 5.13cm, nRMSE = 10.65% for the initial point cloud; after QSF, R2= 0.89, RMSE = 2.51cm, nRMSE = 5.21%; after SOR, R2= 0.92, RMSE = 3.32cm, nRMSE = 6.89%. The findings demonstrate that point cloud filtering, particularly SOR, can increase the accuracy of rice monitoring. The method is effective for monitoring, and after filtering, the accuracy is sufficiently increased to satisfy the needs of growth analysis. This has some potential for application and extension."

Most of the developed drought indices from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) over Africa neglected the influencing roles of individual water storage components in calculating the drought index and thus may either underestimate or overestimate drought characteristics. In this paper, we proposed a Weighted Water Storage Deficit Index for drought assessment over the major river basins in Africa (i. e., Nile, Congo, Niger, Zambezi, and Orange) with accounting for the contribution of each TWS component on the drought signal. We coupled the GRACE data and WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model through utilizing the component contribution ratio as the weight. The results showed that water storage components demonstrated distinctly different contributions to TWS variability and thus drought signal response in onset and duration. The most severe droughts over the Nile, Congo, Niger, Zambezi, and Orange occurred in 2006, 2012, 2006, 2006, and 2003, respectively. The most prolonged drought of 84 months was observed over the Niger basin. This study suggests that considering the weight of individual components in the drought index provides more reasonable and realistic drought estimates over large basins in Africa from GRACE."

Therefore, designing an efficient, lightweight model to obtain better classification results under small samples situations remains a challenging task. To alleviate this problem, a novel, lightweight parallel octave convolutional neural network (LPOCNN) for HSI classification is proposed in this paper. First, the HSI data is preprocessed to construct two three-dimensional (3D) patch cubes with different spatial and spectral scales for each central pixel, removing redundancy and focusing on extracting spatial features and spectral features, respectively. Next, two non- deep parallel branches are created for the two inputs, which design octave convolution rather than classical 3D convolution to facilitate light weighting of the model. Then two-dimensional convolutional neural network is used to extract deeper spectral-spatial features when fusing spectral-spatial features from different parallel layers. Moreover, the spectral-spatial attention is designed to promote the classification performance even further by adaptively adjusting the weights of different spectral-spatial features according to their contribution to classification. Experiments show that our suggested LPOCNN acquires a significant advantage on classification performance over other competitive methods under small sample situations."

Compared with existing road marking extraction methods, not only can extract HMs in presence of wear and occlusion from point clouds, but we also perform a degradation analysis for HMs. First, the HMs candidate area is determined accurately by sophisticated image processing. Second, the prior knowledge of marking design rules and edge-based matching model that leverages the standard geometric template and radiometric appearance of HMs is used for accurately extracting and reconstructing solid lines and nonsolid markings of HMs, respectively. Finally, two degradation indicators are constructed to describe the completeness of the marking contour and consistency within the marking. Comprehensive experiments on two existing highways revealed that the proposed methods achieved an overall performance of 95.4% and 95.4% in the recall and 93.8% and 95.5% in the precision for solid line and nonsolid line markings, respectively, even with imperfect data.

Collections before, during, and after Hurricane Ida in 2021 were used to test the system. The system delivered an F1 score of 0.65 operating with a 2.7 s/frame processing speed with the YOLOv5 large model and an F1 score of 0.55 with a 0.48 s/frame with the YOLOv5 small model. Geo-location uncertainty in the bottom half of the frame was ∼8 m, mostly driven by error in camera pointing measurement. With additional training data to improve performance and detect additional types of features, a fleet of similar drones could autonomously collect actionable post-disaster data."

This study aims to automatically detect, count, and map apricot trees in an orthophoto, covering an area of approximately 48 ha on the ground surface using two different algorithms based on deep learning. Here, Mask region-based convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) and U-Net models were run together with a dilation operator to detect apricot trees in UAV images, and the performances of the models were compared. Results show that Mask R-CNN operated in this way performs better in tree detection, counting, and mapping tasks compared to U-Net. Mask R-CNN with the dilation operator achieved a precision of 98.7%, recall of 99.7%, F1 score of 99.1%, and intersection over union (IoU) of 74.8% for the test orthophoto. U-Net, on the other hand, has achieved a recall of 93.3%, precision of 97.2%, F1 score of 95.2%, and IoU of 58.3% when run with the dilation operator. Mask R-CNN was able to produce successful results in challenging areas. U-Net, on the other hand, showed a tendency to overlook existing trees rather than generate false alarms."

In this study, 12 CNN models (U-Net, FPN, and LinkNet using EfficientNet-B5 backbone, U-Net, SegNet, FCN, and six Residual U-Net models) were generated and used for building segmentation. Inria Aerial Image Labeling Data Set was used to train models, and three data sets (Inria Aerial Image Labeling Data Set, Massachusetts Buildings Data Set, and Syedra Archaeological Site Data Set) were used to evaluate trained models. On the Inria test set, Residual-2 U-Net has the highest F1 and Intersection over Union (IoU) scores with 0.824 and 0.722, respectively. On the Syedra test set, LinkNet-EfficientNet-B5 has F1 and IoU scores of 0.336 and 0.246. On the Massachusetts test set, Residual-4 U-Net has F1 and IoU scores of 0.394 and 0.259. It has been observed that, for all sets, at least two of the top three models used residual connections. Therefore, for this study, residual connections are more successful than conventional convolutional layers."

As an alternate to the conventional approach through wet chemistry, sensor-based noninvasive, rapid, and near-real-time assessment of crop N at the field scale has been the need for precision agriculture. The present study attempts to predict leaf N of wheat crop through spectroscopy using a field portable spectroradiometer (spectral range of 400–2500 nm) on the ground in the crop field and an imaging spectrometer (spectral range of 400–1000 nm) from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with the objectives to evaluate (1) four multivariate spectral models (i.e., artificial neural network, extreme learning machine [ELM], least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, and support vector machine regression) and (2) two sets of hyperspectral data collected from two platforms and two different sensors. In the former part of the study, ELM outperforms the other methods with maximum calibration and validation R2 of 0.99 and 0.96, respectively. Furthermore, the image data set acquired from UAV gives higher performance compared to field spectral data. Also, significant bands are identified using stepwise multiple linear regression and used for modeling to generate a wheat leaf N map of the experimental field."

However, to the best of our knowledge, there is limited knowledge of the addition of airborne Light Detection and Ranging (lidar)-Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and Topographic Position Index (TPI) for urban land cover and land use classification and mapping. The aim of this study was to explore the addition of airborne lidar-DEM and derived TPI to reflect data of Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) in improving the classification accuracy of urban land cover and land use map- ping. Specifically, this study explored the mapping accuracies of urban land cover and land use classifications derived using: 1) standalone Landsat OLI satellite data; 2) Landsat OLI with acquired airborne lidar-DEM ; 3) Landsat OLI with TPI ; and 4) Landsat OLI with airborne lidar-DEM and derived TPI. The results showed that the addition of airborne lidar-DEM and TPI yielded the best overall urban land cover and land use classification accuracy of about 88%. The findings in this study demonstrated that both lidar-DEM and TPI had a positive impact in improving urban land cover and land use classification."

The building shadow length varies according to seasons, which is shown as different digital number values in multi-temporal images. Thus, the bi-temporal satellite remote sensing images of Sentinel-2 are used to estimate the buildings height in this study. An area of 15 km × 15 km in Beijing, China is taken as the study area. By preprocessing the data, the remaining pixels are split into two parts: 70% as the training data set and the rest as the testing data set. Then, one classification model and three regression models are proposed with using Random Forest (RF) method. Based on the testing data, it shows that the accuracy rate of the classification model has reached 98.4% with the kappa coefficient of 0.93. And the regression models' root-mean-square error (RMSE) is 0.61 floor for 1–6 floors group, 0.41 floor for 7–12 floor group, and 0.98 floor for above 12 floor group. The final RMSE is 1.62 floor with RF models. In general, this study shows the feasibility of using satellite mid-resolution optical image to estimate the building height and provides an important reference for regional building height estimation in the future."

Results indicate that orthomosaics can be used for standard mapping and geographic information systems (GIS ) work according to the ASPRS 1990 accuracy standard. In addition, results emphasize that three main factors can affect the horizontal accuracy of orthomosaics: (1) types of CPs, (2) the number of tied photos, and (3) terrain."
The Cellular Automata Approach in Dynamic Modelling of Land Use Change Detection and Future Simulations Based on Remote Sensing Data in Lahore Pakistan,"Ahmad, Muhammad Nasar; Shao, Zhenfeng; Javed, Akib; Islam, Fakhrul; Ahmad, Hafiz Haroon; Aslam, Rana Waqar",pp. 47-55(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2023/00000089/00000001/art00013;jsessionid=mgwp42h4w5e1.x-ic-live-03,"Rapid urbanization has become an immense problem in Lahore city, causing various socio-economic and environmental problems. Therefore, it is noteworthy to monitor land use/land cover (LULC) change detection and future LULC patterns in Lahore. The present study focuses on evaluating the current extent and modeling the future LULC developments in Lahore, Pakistan. Therefore, the semi-automatic classification model has been applied for the classification of Landsat satellite imagery from 2000 to 2020. And the Modules of Land Use Change Evaluation (MOLUSCE) cellular automata (CA-ANN) model was implemented to simulate future land use trends for the years 2030 and 2040. This study project made use of Landsat, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model, and vector data. The research methodology includes three main steps: (i) semi-automatic land use classification using Landsat data from 2000 to 2020; (ii) future land use prediction using the CA-ANN (MOLUSCE) model; and (iii) monitoring change detection and interpretation of results. The research findings indicated that there was a rise in urban areas and a decline in vegetation, barren land, and water bodies for both the past and future projections. The results also revealed that about 27.41% of the urban area has been increased from 2000 to 2020 with a decrease of 42.13% in vegetation, 2.3% in barren land, and 6.51% in water bodies, respectively. The urban area is also expected to grow by 23.15% between 2020 and 2040, whereas vegetation, barren land, and water bodies will all decline by 28.05%, 1.8%, and 12.31%, respectively. Results can also aid in the long-term, sustainable planning of the city. It was also observed that the majority of the city's urban area expansion was found to have occurred in the city's eastern and southern regions. This research also suggests that decision-makers and municipal Government should reconsider city expansion strategies. Moreover, the future city master plans of 2050 must emphasize the relevance of rooftop urban planting and natural resource conservation."

However, the fusion of these multi- source data is still challenging, in which registration is one of the most important stages. In this paper, we propose a method of coarse point cloud registration which consists of two steps. The first step is to extract urban building facades in both an oblique photogram- metric point cloud and a lidar point cloud. The second step is to align the two point clouds using the extracted building facades. Object Vicinity Distribution Feature (Dijkman and Van Den Heuvel 2002) is introduced to describe the distribution of building facades and register the two heterologous point clouds. This method provides a good initial state for later refined registration process and is transla - tion, rotation, and scale invariant. Experiment results show that the accuracy of this proposed automatic registration method is equiva- lent to the accuracy of manual registration with control points."

The present study focused on estimating the current situation and simulating the future LST patterns in Lahore using remote sensing data and machine learning models. The semi-automated classification model was applied for the estimation of LST from 2000 to 2020. Then, the cellular automata-artificial neural networks (CA-ANN) module was implemented to predict future LST patterns for 2030 and 2040, respectively. Our research findings revealed that an average of 2.8 °C of land surface temperature has increased, with a mean LST value from 37.25 °C to 40.10 °C in Lahore during the last two decades from 2000 to 2020. Moreover, keeping CA-ANN simulations for land surface temperature, an increase of 2.2 °C is projected through 2040, and mean LST values will be increased from 40.1 °C to 42.31 °C by 2040. The CA-ANN model was validated for future LST simulation with an overall Kappa value of 0.82 and 86.2% of correctness for the years 2030 and 2040 using modules for land-use change evaluation. The study also indicates that land surface temperature is an important factor in environmental changes. Therefore, it is suggested that future urban planning should focus on urban rooftop plantations and vegetation conservation to minimize land surface temperature increases in Lahore."

However, remote sensing monitoring of water quality is presently focused mainly on phytoplankton, suspended particulate matter, and yellow substance, while there is still great uncertainty in the retrieval of CODMn. In this study, the Landsat-8 surface reflectance data set from Google Earth Engine and in situ CODMnmeasurements were matched. The support vector regression (SVR) machine learning model was calibrated using the matchups. With the SVR model, this study estimates the CODMnin Hongze Lake, presents the historical spatiotemporal CODMndistributions, and discusses the affecting factors of the change trend of the CODMnin Hongze Lake. The results showed that the SVR model adequately estimated CODMn, with a sum squared error of 1.49 mg2/L2, a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.95, and a root mean square error of 0.15 mg/L. CODMnin Hongze Lake was high in general and showed a decreasing trend in the past decade. Huai River, Xinsu River, and Huaihongxin River were still the main sources of oxygen-consuming pollutants in Hongze Lake. The wetland natural reserve near Yugou had a significant effect on reducing CODMn. This study provides not only a scientific reference for the management of CODMnin Hongze Lake, but also a feasible scheme for remote sensing monitoring of CODMnin inland water."

Besides, this study divides the UCCC into three levels: high, medium, and low. The results indicate that: 1) there is a significant spatial heterogeneity of the UCCC in the YRDUA; 2) the UCCC in the YRDUA is generally at medium level and presents a gradually increasing trend; 3) 10 driving factors significantly affect the UCCC, and the influence intensity is non-stationary in time and space. These findings can provide references for improving the UCCC in the YRDUA."

Therefore, vehicle-specific trafficability maps are the need of the hour. Emphasis should be given on soils capable of bearing the moving load of a vehicle and it is an important factor to be considered. Soil variability in spatial and temporal dimensions affects the assessment of off-road trafficability. Genetically, it is assumed that similar soil types behave similarly at a regional scale to reduce the complexity due to its variability. Remolding Cone Index (RCI) of Soil is the indicator of its capability and for generic solution; its value can be related to gravimetric moisture of soil for getting a general idea. In this paper, a logics-based, new concept has been introduced to rationalize the RCI values of these moist areas. Most significantly, moisture- and water-bound areas play an important role in the assessment of off-road trafficability. Therefore, to cover larger areas, a grid-based approach was taken as a base and, to get a preliminary idea of prevailing moisture, Normalized Difference Water Index was also mapped. Every vehicle has fixed vehicle cone index based on its vehicular characteristics and can be related with RCI for trafficability purpose. This new technique will save time and field work and is immensely useful for the trafficability assessment of any specific vehicle."

In this paper, we propose a method of planting structure extraction based on indices and an improved U-Net semantic segmentation network. Based on the original band of Landsat-8, we used an image fusion algorithm to highlight the characteristics of vegetation, water, and soil respectively by three indices added, and the improved U-Net network was used to classify the type of planting structure. The results showed that the overall accuracy of classification was more than 91.6%, and the accuracy of crops was up to 93.8%. Automated water extraction index in image fusion effectively improved the classification accuracy. This method could extract a variety of information about planting structures automatically and accurately. It provided theoretical support for adjusting and optimizing regional planting structures."

The primary aim of this research is to optimize the use of IoT network resources. Earth surface features can be identified and their geo-biophysical properties estimated using radiation as the medium of interaction in remote sensing techniques (RST). Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has significantly improved traditional resource management, which is challenging to model. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) network has to be carried out in real time with excess network resources. Conventional techniques have a significant challenge because of the extensive range and complexity of wireless networks. The DRL method has been used in several areas, including management and allocation of resources, dynamic channel access, mobile downloading, unified edge computing, caching and communication, and fog radio access networks. DRL -IIoT is more successful than the Q-learning technique for a single agent. The design and analysis of the DRL -based approach in stationary base stations to solve the typical assignment of resources issues have been mostly restricted. The DRL is used as a clustering technique to construct the primary model of the system with k-means. This article discusses optical and microwave sensors in RST techniques and applications, examines the areas where there are gaps, and discusses Earth hazards. Furthermore, a comprehensive resource-based strengthening learning system is developed to ensure the best use of resources. Simulation results show that the suggested method efficiently (97.24%) allocates available spectrum, cache, and computer resources to deep deterministic policy gradient benchmarks."

The recently launched, new generation spaceborne hyperspectral sensors, German DLR Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer (DESIS) and Italian PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA), provide unprecedented data in hundreds of narrow spectral bands for the study of the Earth. Therefore, our overarching goal in this study was to use these data to explore advances that can be made in agricultural research. We selected PRISMA and DESIS images during the 2020 growing season in California's Central Valley to study seven major crops. PRISMA and DESIS images were highly correlated (R 2of 0.9–0.95). Out of the 235 DESIS bands (400–1000 nm) and 238 PRISMA bands (400–2500 nm), 26 (11%) and 45 (19%) bands, respectively, were optimal to study agricultural crops. These optimal bands provided crop type classification accuracies of 83–90%.

In particular, in order to reduce the false positive of buildings, we design the foreground-aware module using the attention gate block, which effectively suppresses the features of nonbuilding and enhances the sensitivity of the model to buildings. In addition, we introduce the reverse attention mechanism in the detail refinement module. Specifically, this module guides the network to learn to supplement the missing details of the buildings by erasing the currently predicted regions of buildings and achieves more accurate and complete building extraction. To further optimize the network, we design hybrid loss, which combines BCE loss and SSIM loss, to supervise network learning from both pixel and structure layers. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our network over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality."

A technique is presented that uses orbital plane geometry to compute the rotation angle as a function of geographic latitude between GEO image space and radiometrically corrected (RAD ) image space. First, a nonlinear forward model is established that translates the residual errors in roll, pitch, and yaw to scan errors and pixel errors in GEO image space. Subsequently, the inverse problem is solved using Newton's method of nonlinear optimization for estimating residual roll, pitch, and yaw. We demonstrate our results on data products of the high-resolution Indian satellites Cartosat-2E and Cartosat-2F. Further, the superiority of the proposed method is established by comparing it with multiple existing methods in the literature. The R2 measures of goodness of fit for roll, pitch, and yaw estimation based on RAD and GEO products using the proposed method are 0.65, 0.99, and 0.65, respectively; using the existing method, they are 0.074, 0.005, and 0.50."

The development relied on Taipei test areas covering 13.5 km2before application to the megacity of Jakarta. Of the captured Taipei buildings, 48.8% are at one-to-one extraction, improving to 71.9% for larger buildings with total floor area >8000 m2, and to 99% when tightly-spaced building clusters are further included. Mean absolute error in extracted footprint area is 16% for these larger buildings. The extraction parameters are tuned for Jakarta buildings using small test areas before covering Jakarta's 643 km2with over 1.247 million buildings extracted."
A Semi-Supervised Learning Method for Hyperspectral-Image Open Set Classification,"Duan, Zhaolin; Chen, Hao; Li, Xiaohua; Zhou, Jiliu; Wang, Yuan",pp. 653-664(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2022/00000088/00000010/art00011;jsessionid=75lglrldtg0o7.x-ic-live-01,"We present a conceptually simple and flexible method for hyperspectral-image open set classification. Unlike previous methods, where the abundant unlabeled data inherent in the data set are ignored completely and unknown classes are inferred using score post-calibration, our approach makes the unlabeled data join in and help to train a simple and practical model for open set classification. The model is able to provide an explicit decision score for both unknown classes and each known class. The main idea of the proposed method is augmenting the original training set of K known classes using the pseudo-labeled unknown-category samples that are detected elaborately from the unlabeled data using modified OpenMax and semi-supervised iterative learning. Then a (K + 1)-class deep convolutional neural network model is trained based on the augmented training set with (K + 1) class samples. The model can not only classify instances of each known class but also refuse instances of unknown class explicitly. We validated the proposed method on four well-known hyperspectral-image data sets, obtaining superior performance over previous methods."
The Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) and Associated Driving Factors of Modeling in Mining Areas,"Li, Jun; Guo, Tianyu; Zhang, Chengye; Yang, Fei; Sang, Xiao",pp. 665-671(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2022/00000088/00000010/art00012;jsessionid=75lglrldtg0o7.x-ic-live-01,"To determine the fractional vegetation cover (FVC ) and associated driving factors of modeling in mining areas, six types of data were used as driving factors and three methods—multi-linear regression (MLR ), geographically weighted regression (GWR ), and geographically weighted artificial neural network (GWANN )—were adopted in the modeling. The experiments, conducted in Shengli mining areas located in Xilinhot city, China, show that the MLR model without consideration of spatial heterogeneity and spatial non-stationarity performs the worst and that the GWR model presents obvious location differences, since it predefines a linear relationship which is unable to describe FVC for some locations. The GWANN model, improving on these defects, is the most suitable model for the FVC driving process in mining areas; it outperforms the other two models, with root-mean-square error (RMSE ) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE ) reaching 0.16 and 0.20. It has improvements of approximately 24% in RMSE and 33% in MAPE compared to the MLR model, and those values grow to 59% and 71% when compared with the GWR model."

Ecosystem services provided by urban green space have been increasingly incorporated into city-level measures to address climate change. Understanding the relationship between urban green space (UGS) and urban impervious surface (UIS) as well as land surface temperature (LST ) is crucial to the understanding of urban spatial morphology. To better understand the impact of different spatial configurations on the urban heat island effect at different scales, this study constructed the spatial configuration of UIS and UGS on four grids of different scales and explored their relationship with LST in sea- sonal changes. The results show that different indicators present significant characteristic disparity under the four grid scales, compared with other scales, indicators have a relative stability correlation at 1 km. In addition, trees and grass, as different urban green spaces, have notable negative effects on surface temperature. At grid 3 (G3) scale, grassland had a strong correlation with LST in aggregation index and landscape shape index, which were 0.473 and 0.648, suggesting that fine-scale planning is of great significance to alleviating the urban heat island effect. This study can assist in designing sustainable cities by providing insights into urban green space planning and management."

In this article, 30-m annual LULC changes are obtained from 1990 to 2020 in the Yangtze River basin (YRB). The results show an overall accuracy rate of 82.66% and better performances on Geo-Wiki test samples when compared to similar products.

In this article, a new and simple boundary-based method is proposed for ground-point filtering from the photogrammetric point-cloud data. The proposed method uses the local height difference to extract the boundaries of objects. Then the extracted boundary points are traced to generate polygons around the borders of any objects on the ground. Finally, the points located inside these polygons, which are classified as non-ground points, are filtered. The experimental results on the photogrammetric point cloud show that the proposed method can adapt to complex environments. The total error of the proposed method is about 8.96%, which is promising in these challenging data sets. Moreover, the proposed method is compared with cloth simulation filtering, multi-scale curvature classification, and gLiDAR methods and gives better results."

The availability of energy-efficient infrastructures and utilities depend on the sustainability of smart cities. The big streaming data generated and collected by smart building devices and systems contain useful information that needs to be used to make timely action and better decisions. The ultimate objective of these procedures is to enhance the city's sustainability and livability. The replacement of decades-old infrastructures, such as underground wiring, steam pipes, transportation tunnels, and high-speed Internet installation, is already a major problem for major urban regions. There are still certain regions in big cities where broadband wireless service is not available. The decision support system is recently acquiring increasing attention in the smart city context. In this article, a deep learning–based sustainable decision support system (DLSDSS) has been proposed for energy building in smart cities. This study proposes the integration of the Internet of Things into smart buildings for energy management, utilizing deep learning methods for sensor information decision making. Building a socially advanced environment aims to enhance city services and urban administration for residents in smart cities using remote sensing techniques. The proposed deep learning methods classify buildings based on energy efficiency. Data gathered from the sensor network to plan smart cities' development include a deep learning algorithm's structural assembly of data. The deep learning algorithm provides decision makers with a model for the big data stream. The numerical results show that the proposed method reduces energy consumption and enhances sensor data accuracy by 97.67% with better decision making in planning smart infrastructures and services. The experimental outcome of the DLSDSS enhances accuracy (97.67%), time complexity (98.7%), data distribution rate (97.1%), energy consumption rate (98.2%), load shedding ratio (95.8%), and energy efficiency (95.4%)."

Herein we propose the Shift Window Attention of building SWAB-net based on the transformer model to solve the semantic segmentation of building objects. Moreover, the shift window strategy was adopted to determine buildings using urban satellite images with 4 m resolution to extract the features of sequence images efficiently and accurately. We evaluated the proposed network on SpaceNet 7, and the results of comprehensive analysis showed that the network is conducive for efficient remote sensing image research."

This study goal is to investigate if adding Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and digital elevation model (DEM) data as ancillary data to the Landsat-8 spectral imagery (acquired on 14 April 2016) in the support vector machine (SVM ) classification process improves LULC mapping accuracy in GuaMusang, Malaysia. ENVI software was used to preprocess a single Landsat-8 image, convert it to reflectance, and calculate NDVI. ASTER-GDEM data were used to generate the DEM. The logical channel method was used to combine NDVI and DEM with Landsat-8 bands and limit the impact of shadows during SVM classification. The SVM accuracy was tested and evaluated on ancillary data and Landsat-8 spectral-based collection. The results revealed that the user's accuracy and producer's accuracy improved by 15.1% and 2.1%, for primary forest and by 17.93% and 28.86% for secondary forest, respectively. The classification reliability of the majority of LULC categories has increased significantly. Compared to SVM spectral-based set, the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the SVM ancillary-based set improved by 8.77% and 0.12, respectively. In conclusion, this article demonstrated that integrating DEM and NDVI data improves Landsat-8 image classification precision."
Monitoring Environment Transformation Along the BTIC Railway Based on Remote Sensing by Utilizing the R_RSEI,"Zhang, Zhihua; Wu, Xiaowen; Li, Yikun; Yan, Kun; Zhang, Fan; Yang, Shuwen; Yang, Jun",pp. 517-525(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2022/00000088/00000008/art00010;jsessionid=3gw1bxthjasuf.x-ic-live-02,"High-speed railway offers an opportunity to address the disparity between economic development and transportation capacity. It can improve transportation capacity and reduce transportation costs. With the large-scale running of the high-speed railway, initial activities will impact the surrounding ecological environment. Ecological environment monitoring along the railway is very important. However, the current research focuses mainly on a single ecological index evaluation of ecological problems and mostly on the ecological evaluation along the highway, with less research on ecological monitoring along the high-speed railway. Moreover, the studies have not considered the comprehensive effects of multiple remote sensing indexes. Given the above scientific issues, taking the Beijing–Tianjin Intercity (BTIC ) railway as the study area, we selected the Landsat satellite images from 2008, 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 as the research data. We used the revised remote sensing–based ecological index (R_RSEI) to comprehensively analyze and evaluate the ecological environment quality along the BTIC railway from 2008 to 2020. After extracting the greenness, dryness, humidity, and heat indices, we determined the weights of four indices using principal component analysis. According to the ecological environment assessment index model, we monitored and analyzed the ecological environment along the BTIC railway. The results showed that the ecological environment quality along the BTIC railway generally increased from 2008 to 2011 and then generally decreased from 2014 to 2020. The ecological and environmental qual- ity of the study area generally was ranked as ""poor"" and ""worse."" Therefore, the trend of environmental pollution along the BTIC railway was not optimistic and thus led to many problems in the ecological environment. The proposed method is expected to solve the lack or the single problem of ecological evaluation index along the railway line."

The proposed method was designed to be effective in enhancing the integrity and accuracy of point clouds generated by stereo matching. To overcome the limitations of stereo matching, we trained a CNN to predict how well image patches match and used it in patch optimization. The main advantage of this approach is that the proposed algorithm can decrease the mismatching and errors caused by noise, deep discontinuity, and weak texture in low-altitude remote sensing images and can reconstruct an integrated and accurate point cloud. Comparative studies and experimental results validate the accuracy of the proposed algorithm when used for dense point generation from low-altitude remote sensing images."

Recently, some spectral-spatial–feature deep learning–based convolutional neural networks have been proposed and demonstrated remarkable classification performance. However, these networks are time consuming when facing a real HSI in practical application. The trained model must be forwarded independently across m × m crops of the image in strides of 1 pixel. In this article, an efficient and practical network was proposed for HSI classification that can take an HSI as an input instance and directly output a dense pixel-level classification map. First, a novel mechanism, training based on pixels and prediction based on images (TPPI ), is proposed and formulated. Second, some basic rules that should be obeyed during network design and implementation are given. Finally, following the basic rules, three TPPI -Nets are derived and demonstrated based on state-of- the-art classification networks. Experimental results on three public data sets show that the proposed TPPI-Net can not only obtain higher classification accuracy than the existing DCNN-based methods but also greatly reduce the computational complexity of HSI classification."

Derived from airborne lidar point cloud, the HTD comprises three parts: (1) High Resolution Hydraulic Three-Dimensional Features: high resolution three-dimensional vector data that preserves the locations and elevations of topography breaklines, (2) Hydraulic Digital Elevation Model: high resolution (1 × 1 m) DEM enhanced by the terrain breaklines to preserve the landscape characteristics, and (3) Hydraulic Digital Surface Model: high resolution (1 × 1 m) DSM conditioned by removing the height of vegetation and temporary objects. With HTD, hydraulic features such as drainages with 10 m of width can be identified and properly set up in numerical models, thus can help simulating and access- ing the flood in urban area more in detail. Through case studies we demonstrate how HTD can affect the results of hydraulic modeling. The results show that HTD can help modelers to construct proper mesh (or computational grids) for 2D hydraulic modeling, and pre- serve topography characteristics (i. e., shape and elevation), which improves the modeling results in terms of spatial resolution and physical rationality, while still keeping the computation efficient."

Specifically, a group of individual classifiers were identified and trained to derive land cover information from a satellite image covering a large complex coastal city. The mapping accuracy was quantitatively assessed with an independent reference data set, and several class probability measures were derived for each classifier. Meanwhile, various subsets were derived from the original training data set using the times of being correctly labeled by the individual classifiers as the thresholds, which were further used to train a random forest model as the combiner in generating the final class predictions. While outperforming each individual classifier, the combiner performed better when using the class probabilities rather than the class predictions as the meta-feature layers and performed significantly better when trained with a carefully selected subset rather than with the entire sample set. The novelties of this work are with the insight into the impact of different training sample subsets on the performance of stacked generalization and the filtering technique developed to prepare training samples for the combiner leading to a large accuracy improvement."

Previous studies have shown high-resolution remote sensing as a tool for urban vegetation mapping, but the low temporal resolution of these data limits their use for phenological modeling. Therefore, it is of great significance to evaluate Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery for urban vegetation phenology monitoring. Here, we extracted the start and end of growing season (SOS and EOS) in urban ecosystems based on both the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from the 250 m MODIS vegetarion indices product (MOD13Q1). Then the accuracies of the satellite-derived SOS and EOS were evaluated through comparing phenological observations at 18 ground sites. Results showed that SOS was most consistent with the prime of leaf unfolding date and EOS was most consistent with the beginning of leaf coloring date. Overall, EVI was found to have stronger predictive strength than NDVI in detecting urban vegetation phenology in terms of both higher correlation coef- ficients and lower root-mean-square errors. In addition, the dynamic threshold method was more accurate in deriving SOS, while the double logistic method had relatively higher accuracy in deriving EOS ."

However, for reconstructing narrow and confined spaces such as the interior of drainage pipes, selecting geometrically optimal frames is a major challenge, not only to reduce the number of needed frames but also to yield better geometry. This paper introduces a coarse-to-fine method to optimize the selection of monocular video frames based on a geometric criterion called feature-based parallax analysis for 3D pipe reconstruction. The proposed method was applied in two experiments with a monocular camera fixed on a customized robot. Experimental results show that our approach only requires respectively 9.66% and 3.15% of the number of frames. The spatial distribution of the retrieved frames was uniform and reasonable, enabling the successful SfM process to achieve a complete reconstruction of the pipe geometry."

The dynamic changes in the urban area can reflect the urban expansion process and spatial development model. Carrying out urban expansion monitoring and extracting urban areas is of great importance for grasping the law of urban development and promoting the sustainable development of cities. However, the related research reveals several problems such as insufficient accuracy and low intelligence of urban boundary extraction. In response to these problems, this paper proposes a new method for urban area extraction based on the progressive learning model. By combining prior knowledge and image features, the number of training samples required for machine learning is reduced, and the problem of using high-level semantic information expression in the process of urban areas is avoided by using the classification method, and thus the accuracy of urban area extraction is improved. The method uses urban road network data to divide the city into blocks. It applies the scene classification method to extract the urban areas and uses the pyramid layer-by-layer to carry out the space constraint method to integrate the urban extraction principle into the machine learning process, which can be obtained and kept artificial under a small sample condition. Extracting the effect of the urban area is very close, greatly reducing the workload and providing a new solution for high-precision automatic extraction of urban areas. Through the analysis of urban expansion, the following results were obtained: (1) from 2000 to 2015, China's provincial capital cities maintained a high-speed growth trend with a total area increased by 90%; (2) urban expansion showed significant regional differences. The eastern expansion rate gradually slowed down, the western and northeast regions accelerated their expansion, and the central region expanded steadily; (3) 61% of the provincial capital cities expanded exponentially; (4) the development of China's provincial capital cities was highly correlated with national urban development policies and regional development strategies."

The increasing performance of cameras equipped in smartphones opens new opportunities for extensive FVC measurement through citizen science initiatives. However, the wide field of view (FOV) of smartphone cameras constitutes a key source of uncertainty in the estimation of vegetation parameters, which has been largely ignored. We designed a practical method to characterize the FOV of smartphones and improve the FVC estimation. The method was assessed in a mountainous forest based on the comparison with in situ fisheye photographs. After the FOV correction, the agreement of smart-phone and fisheye FVC estimates highly improved: root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.103 compared to 0.242 of the original smartphone FVC estimates without considering the FOV effect, mean difference of 0.074 versus 0.213, and coefficient of determinationR2of 0.719 versus 0.353. Smartphone cameras outperform traditional fisheye cameras: the overexposure and low vertical resolution of fisheye photographs introduced uncertainties in FVCestimation while the insensitivity to exposure and high spatial resolution of smartphone cameras make photograph acquisition and analysis more automatic and accurate. The smartphone FVCestimates highly agree with the GF-1 satellite product: RMSE = 0.066, bias = 0.007, andR2= 0.745. This study opens new perspectives for the validation of satellite products."

The 2D point cloud acquired by the horizontal laser scanner and the orientation information obtained by the microelectromechanical systems are used as inputs for a simultaneous localization and mapping framework to estimate the 2D poses. The height information acquired by the laser range finder is then fused to obtain the 3D pose, which is applied to restore the actual position and orientation of the 2D point cloud generated by the tilted laser scanner to reconstruct the 3D point cloud of the indoor environment. The experimental results—three typical indoor scenes—demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve accuracies of 3 cm and 2°. Therefore, the proposed approach is a low-cost, portable, and accurate solution for indoor 3D mapping."

The DJI P4 Multispectral drone combined with the Agisoft Metashape Structure from Motion/Multi View Stereo software is some of the most cost-effective equipment for creating high-resolution orthomosaic VI images. However, the manufacturer's procedure results in remarkable location estimation inaccuracy (average error: 3.27–3.45 cm) and alignment errors between spectral bands (average error: 2.80–2.84 cm). We developed alternative processing procedures to overcome these issues, and we achieved a higher positioning accuracy (average error: 1.32–1.38 cm) and better alignment accuracy between spectral bands (average error: 0.26–0.32 cm). The proposed procedure enables precise VI analysis, especially when using the green chlorophyll index for corn, and may help accelerate the application of remote sensing techniques to agriculture."

Comparing the Sensitivity of Pixel-Based and Sub-Watershed-Based Analytic Hierarchy Process to Weighting Criteria for Flood Hazard Estimation,"Zhang, Hongping; Shao, Zhenfeng; Wu, Wenfu; Huang, Xiao; Sun, Jisong; Zhao, Jinqi; Fan, Yewen",pp. 343-352(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2022/00000088/00000005/art00013;jsessionid=1s8y9hf5f2x5n.x-ic-live-02,"In flood hazard estimation via the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), using the pixel as the basic unit might lead to accuracy relying on the optimal weighting criteria. To this end, considering the sub-watershed as the basic unit is new. In this study, taking the Chaohu Basin in Anhui Province, China, as a study case, the accuracy of the sensitivity of the pixel-based and sub-watershed-based AHP models influenced by weighting criteria was compared. There were 48 judgment ma- trixes defined, following the same order of importance of the involved indicators. Validation ground truthing is constructed by the extracted flooded regions from GF-3 images. As weighting criteria changed, the results indicated that the pixel-based AHP fluctuated significantly, while the correct ratio and fit ratio derived by the sub-watershed-based AHP could improve by >35% and >5%, respectively, over the pixel-based-AHP. It indicated that the sub-watershed-based AHP has an advantage in relying less on in situ weighting criteria than the pixel-based AHP."

The earth surface fingerprint is established here by mining the relationship between spatial objects with stable characteristics extracted from urban high-resolution remote sensing images, which realizes intelligent perception of geographical location innovatively. Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network is used to automatically extract the spatial objects such as playgrounds, crossroads, and bridges from the images. Then, the extracted spatial objects are encoded according to the landuse type, distance, and angle of 24 nearest objects to construct urban surface fingerprint database. The urban surface fingerprint database is used to match the geographical location of spatial objects in local images so that the matching algorithm can be used for machine recognition of the geographical location of specific objects in the target image. Taking the main cities in China as the experimental area, the success rate of location perception is 92%. We have made a useful exploration in the field of MIP of geographical location, hoping to promote the development of human cognition of geographical location."

The spatial heterogeneity ofLSTis affected by natural and human factors, with seasonal differences. This study selected Dongguan, a rapidly urbanizing city in China, as an example to analyze the relationship between the spatial heterogeneity ofLSTin different seasons and influencing factors in six dimensions. Multi-source spatial data were combined, including Landsat images, meteorological data, digital elevation models, National Polar-Orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite nighttime light, and points of interest. The results show that spatial patterns ofLSTacross different seasons were consistent, although there were local differences. Based on the GeoDetector model, the result indicated differences between separate effects and interactive effects, and identified the high temperature risk areas."

The aim of this study was to map and monitor the spatial and temporal change in urban land cover and land use in Davidson County, Tennessee in the periods of 2013, 2016, and 2020. The urban land cover and land use categories were classified and mapped using Random Forest algorithm. A combination of Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite data with Light Detection and Ranging (lidar)-Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and derived Topographic Position Index (TPI) were used in the classification and monitoring of urban land cover and land use change. The urban land cover and land use types were mapped with average overall accuracies of about 87% in 2020, 85% in 2016 and 2013. The overall accuracy increased by around 8%, 9%, and 6% in 2020, 2016, and 2013 classifications respectively when lidarDEMand derived TPIwere added to Landsat OLIsatellite data in the classification relative to standalone Landsat OLI. Total change occurred in about 63% of Davidson County between 2016 and 2020 with significant net gains and losses among land cover and land use types. This information could support land use planning."

Deep learning convolutional neural nets (CNNs) demonstrate a remarkable success in automated image analysis. Inferential strengths ofCNNmodels are driven primarily by the quality and volume of hand-labeled training samples. Production of hand-annotated samples is a daunting task. This is particularly true for regional-scale mapping applications, such as permafrost feature detection across the Arctic. Image augmentation is a strategic ""data-space"" solution to synthetically inflate the size and quality of training samples by transforming the color space or geometric shape or by injecting noise. In this study, we systematically investigate the effectiveness of a spectrum of augmentation methods when applied toCNNalgorithms to recognize ice-wedge polygons from commercial satellite imagery. Our findings suggest that a list of augmentation methods (such as hue, saturation, and salt and pepper noise) can increase the model performance."

There is a lack of suitability assessment for existing pan-sharpening methods applied to SuperView-1 images. This study proposes an evaluation method that integrates visual evaluation, spectral analysis of typical objects, and quantitative indicators to evaluate the advantages of different pan-sharpening methods in different scenes of SuperView-1 imagery. Four scenes (urban areas, farmland, sparse vegetation, mixed surfaces) are selected to evaluate eight typical pan-sharpening methods (Brovey, principal component analysis (PCA), Gram-Schmidt (GS), band-dependent spatial-detail (BDSD), high-pass filtering (HPF), smoothing filter-based intensity modulation (SFIM), modulation transfer function-generalized Laplacian pyramid (MTF-GLP),MTF-GLP-high pass modulation (MTF-GLP-HPM). The results show that the suitability of each pan-sharpening method is different in various scenes.PCA, Brovey, andGSdistort the spectral information greatly, and the stability of the pan-sharpening results in different scenes which are poor.BDSDhas strong stability and can better balance the relationship between spectral distortion and spatial distortion in different scenes. The multi-resolution analysis method has better applicability and stability for SuperView-1 imagery, among whichMTF-GLPandMTF-GLP-HPMperform better in the pan-sharpening results. This study provides a reference for the selection of pan-sharpening methods for SuperView-1 imagery in different application fields."

It is significant for evaluating the impact of large-scale solar parks on the environment for the sustainable development of the photovoltaic industry. At present, researchers have paid attention to changes in the local thermal environment caused by solar parks. As a new type of solar park, the influence of floating solar parks on urban land surface temperature distribution patterns is still unclear. In this article, we (1) take the floating solar parks in Huainan City, China, as the study area; (2) calculate the land surface temperature (LST) of the study area and its adjacent areas by using Landsat 8 remote sensing data and the radiation transfer equation method; and (3) judge the influence of solar parks on the distribution pattern of LST. On this basis, we analyzed the influence range and seasonal differences of floating solar parks on LST. Our results revealed that, first, the floating solar park has a warming effect in the summer and winter, and the warming area is concentrated mainly within 200 m of the photovoltaic panels' coverage area. Second, during the construction phase and after the completion of the floating solar parks, the average monthly LST of the solar panels is generally higher than the water, and the average annual temperature increase in the above two stages is 3.26°C and 4.50°C, respectively. The change of floating solar parks on urban LST distribution patterns may impact the local ecosystem. In the future, it is necessary to consider the impact of floating solar parks on local LST during the construction of floating solar parks."

In some Indian locations, water quality monitoring is conducted only once a year due to associated costs and time. To aid such instances, in this study, stepwise linear regression models were developed using in situ (annual) and Landsat 7 (biweekly) remote sensing data and validated for two inland water bodies (Sursagar and Nalsarovar lakes) in Gujarat state for dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, electrical conductivity, pH, and nitrate. Results indicated that all models showed good to excellent performance metrics based on an r value (p < 0.01) ranging from 0.86 to 0.98 and 0.72 to 0.99 for Sursagar and Nalsarovar lakes, respectively. All models had root mean square errors less than 0.5, and residual predictive deviations greater than 2, which depicted good predictability. The models were able to increase the water quality assessment from annual resolution to biweekly resolution and provided insights on the dynamics of water quality parameters, improved understanding on key drivers for the change, and identified peak pollution leading to unfit conditions for domestic or agricultural consumption."

We have developed a novel high-performance image-analysis framework—Mapping Application for Arctic Permafrost Land Environment (MAPLE)—that enables the integration of operational-scale GeoAI capabilities into Arctic permafrost modeling. Interoperability across heterogeneous HPC systems and optimal usage of computational resources are key design goals of MAPLE. We systematically compared the performances of four different MAPLE workflow designs on two HPC systems. Our experimental results on resource utilization, total time to completion, and overhead of the candidate designs suggest that the design of an optimal workflow largely depends on the HPC system architecture and underlying service-unit accounting model."

The MSTTIFN builds nonlinear mappings between the input Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LSTs and the out- put Landsat LSTs at the target date with two pairs of references and therefore enhances the resolution of time-series LSTs. We conduct experiments on the actual Landsat andMODISdata in two study areas (Beijing and Shandong) and compare our proposed MSTTIFN with four competing methods: the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model, the Flexible Spatiotemporal Data Fusion Model, a two-stream convolutional neural network (StfNet), and a deep learning-based spatiotemporal temperature-fusion network.

Making use of Terrestrial Laser Scanning data, this paper presents a method for seismic damage information extraction. This new method is based on principal component analysis calculating the local surface curvature of each point in the point cloud. Then use the nearest point angle algorithm, combined with the data features of the actual measured value to identify point cloud seismic information, and filter the points that tend to the plane by setting the threshold value. Based on the statistical analysis of the normal vector, the raw point cloud data are deplanarized to obtain the preliminary results of seismic damage information. The density clustering algorithm is used to denoise the initially extracted seismic damage information. Ultimately, we can obtain the distribution patterns and characteristics of cracks in the walls of the building. The extraction result of the seismic damage information point cloud data is compared with the photos collected at the site, showing that the algorithm steps successfully identify the crack and shed wall skin information recorded in the site photos (identification rate: 95%). Point cloud distribution maps of cracked and shed siding areas determine quantitative information on seismic damage, providing a higher level of performance and detail than direct contact measurements."

Therefore, cloud detection of remote sensing images is an indispensable part of image preprocessing and image availability screening. Aiming at the lack of short wave infrared and thermal infrared bands in ZY-3 high-resolution satellite images resulting in the poor detection effect, considering the obvious difference in geographic height between cloud and ground surface objects, this paper proposes a thick and thin cloud detection method combining spectral information and digital height model (DHM) based on multi-scale features-convolutional neural network (MF-CNN) model. To verify the importance of DHM height information in cloud detection of ZY-3 multi-angle remote sensing images, this paper implements cloud detection comparison of the data set with and without DHM height information based on the MF-CNN model. The experimental results show that the ZY-3 multi-angle image with DHM height information can effectively improve the confusion between highlighted surface and thin cloud, which also means the assistance of DHM height information can make up for the disadvantage of high-resolution image lacking short wave infrared and thermal infrared bands."

Specifically, this study assessed the overall mapping accuracies of the canopy cover classification of southern yellow pines derived using four data-integration scenarios: Landsat OLI alone; Landsat OLI andSentinel-1; Landsat OLI with vegetation indices derived from satellite data—normalized difference vegetation index, soil-adjusted vegetation index, modified soil-adjusted vegetation index, transformed soil-adjusted vegetation index, and infrared percentage vegetation index; and 4) Landsat OLI withSentinel-1and vegetation indices. The results showed that the integration of Landsat OLI reflectance bands withSentinel-1backscattering coefficients and vegetation indices yielded the best overall classification accuracy, about 77%, and standalone Landsat OLI the weakest accuracy, approximately 67%. The findings in this study demonstrate that the addition of backscattering coefficients fromSentinel-1and vegetation indices positively contributed to the mapping of southern yellow pines."

To further enhance the application for timely monitoring, the real-time STSU( RSTSU) method was developed for real-time data. In RSTSU, we usually choose a spatially complete MODIS–Landsat image pair as auxiliary data. Due to cloud contamination, the temporal distance between the required effective auxiliary data and the real-time data to be unmixed can be large, causing great land cover changes and uncertainty in the extracted unchanged pixels (i.e., training samples). In this article, to extract more reliable training samples, we propose choosing the auxiliary MODIS–Landsat data temporally closest to the prediction time. To deal with the cloud contamination in the auxiliary data, we propose an augmented sample-based RSTSU( ARSTSU) method. ARSTSU selects and augments the training samples extracted from the valid (i.e., non-cloud) area to synthesize more training samples, and then trains an effective learning model to predict the proportions. ARSTSU was validated using two MODIS data sets in the experiments. ARSTSU expands the applicability of RSTSU by solving the problem of cloud contamination in temporal neighbors in actual situations."

It is not possible to conduct ground-based surveys to monitor such huge disasters in a timely and adequate manner. Therefore, we used a combination of automatic and manual remote sensing data processing techniques to find out the aftereffects of locust attack effectively. We processed MODIS -normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI ) manually on ENVI and Landsat 8 NDVI using the Google Earth Engine (GEE ) cloud computing platform. We found from the results that, (a) NDVI computation on GEE is more effective, prompt, and reliable compared with the results of manual NDVI computations; (b) there is a high effect of locust disasters in the northern part of Sindh, Thul, Ghari Khairo, Garhi Yaseen, Jacobabad, and Ubauro, which are more vulnerable; and (c) NDVI value suddenly decreased to 0.68 from 0.92 in 2020 using Landsat NDVI and from 0.81 to 0.65 using MODIS satellite imagery. Results clearly indicate an abrupt decrease in vegetation in 2020 due to a locust disaster. That is a big threat to crop yield and food production because it provides a major portion of food chain and gross domestic product for Sindh, Pakistan."

Multi-View Urban Scene Classification with a Complementary-Information Learning Model,"Geng, Wanxuan; Zhou, Weixun; Jin, Shuanggen",pp. 65-72(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2022/00000088/00000001/art00015;jsessionid=45934qu8vgk5n.x-ic-live-01,"Traditional urban scene-classification approaches focus on images taken either by satellite or in aerial view. Although single-view images are able to achieve satisfactory results for scene classification in most situations, the complementary information provided by other image views is needed to further improve performance. Therefore, we present a complementary information-learning model (CILM) to perform multi-view scene classification of aerial and ground-level images. Specifically, the proposedCILMtakes aerial and ground-level image pairs as input to learn view-specific features for later fusion to integrate the complementary information. To trainCILM, a unified loss consisting of cross entropy and contrastive losses is exploited to force the network to be more robust. OnceCILMis trained, the features of each view are extracted via the two proposed feature-extraction scenarios and then fused to train the support vector machine classifier for classification. The experimental results on two publicly available benchmark data sets demonstrate thatCILMachieves remarkable performance, indicating that it is an effective model for learning complementary information and thus improving urban scene classification."
Semi-Automated Roller Parameters Extraction from Terrestrial Lidar,"Deshpande, Sagar S.; Falk, Mike; Plooster, Nathan",pp. 879-890(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2021/00000087/00000012/art00011;jsessionid=2v5wf1ht3p798.x-ic-live-03,"Rollers are an integral part of a hot-rolling steel mill. They transport hot metal from one end of the mill to another. The quality of the steel highly depends on the surface quality of the rollers. This paper presents semi-automated methodologies to extract roller parameters from terrestrial lidar points. The procedure was divided into two steps. First, the three-dimensional points were converted to a two-dimensional image to detect the extents of the rollers using fast Fourier transform image matching. Lidar points for every roller were iteratively fitted to a circle. The radius and center of the fitted circle were considered as the average radius and average rotation axis of the roller, respectively. These parameters were also extracted manually and were compared to the measured parameters for accuracy analysis. The proposed methodology was able to extract roller parameters at millimeter level. Erroneously identified rollers were identified by moving average filters. In the second step, roller parameters were determined using the filtered roller points. Two data sets were used to validate the proposed methodologies. In the first data set, 366 out of 372 rollers (97.3%) were identified and modeled. The second, smaller data set consisted of 18 rollers which were identified and modelled accurately."

This study aimed to analyze crop-growth indicators such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), crop height, and vegetated surface roughness to determine the growth of corn crops from planting to harvest. Digital elevation models and orthophotos generated from the data captured using multispectral, red/green/blue, and near-infrared sensors mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle were processed and analyzed to calculate the various crop-growth indicators. The results suggest that remote sensing-based growth indicators can effectively determine crop growth over time, and that there are similarities and correlations between the indicators."

However, improving its accuracy remains challenging due to complicated background objects and different viewing angles from various remotely sensed images. The hereto proposed methods predominantly focus on multi-scale feature learning, which omits features in multiple aspect ratios. Moreover, postprocessing is required to refine the segmentation performance. We propose modified semantic segmentation (MSegnet), a single-shot semantic segmentation model based on a matrix of convolution layers to extract features in multiple scales and aspect ratios. MSegnet consists of two modules: backbone feature learning and matrix convolution to conduct vertical and horizontal learning. The matrix convolution comprises a set of convolution operations with different aspect ratios. MSegnet is applied to a public building data set that is widely used for evaluation and shown to achieve satisfactory accuracy, compared with the published single-shot methods."

As two key elements of the natural geographical environment, rocks and soils play an important role in the study of surface processes. Inherent surface characteristics, such as surface roughness, composition, and density are critical parameters for the remote monitoring of land surfaces as they affect the polarization characteristics of scattered light waves. In this study, we investigated the relationship between surface roughness, composition, and density, and the polarization spectra of limestone-dolomite series rock. Results reveal a power function relationship between the surface roughness and the degree of polarization peaks among different detection zenith and azimuth angles. The depth and position of the absorbing waveband are significantly correlated with the characteristic component contents. The rock density was determined via the polarized reflection spectra, with the Earth's surface density calculations associated with a 2.6% divergence from the current recognized data. Our results demonstrate the ability of polarized spectra to retrieve surface roughness, composition, and density, with potential for further development in future work."

The PROM is suitable for cases in which attitude or orientation parameters are unknown in the panoramic-image sequence. First, feature points are extracted and matched from panoramic-image pairs using the SURF algorithm. Second, these matched feature points are used to solve the relative attitude parameters in the PROM. Then, combining the PROM with the absolute position and attitude parameters of the initial panoramic image, the MMS lidar points and panoramic-image sequence are registered. Finally, the registration accuracy of the PROM method is assessed using corresponding points manually selected from the MMSlidar points and panoramic-image sequence. The results show that three types of MMSdata sources are registered accurately based on the proposed registration method. Our method transforms the registration of panoramic images and lidar points into image feature-point matching, which is suitable for diverse road scenes compared with existing methods."

This estuarine area is characterized by intense sediment transport turning the water muddy, and thus optical bathymetric estimations are difficult. We used 24 spectral bands in a range of 500–900 nm acquired with a hyperspectral camera aboard an unmanned aerial vehicle, together with 100 bathymetry data points surveyed with a sonar sensor aboard an unmanned surface vehicle, covering an area of about 800 m2. Random-forest and support-vector-machine regressors were trained with this data set. The resulting model yielded a determination coefficient of 0.815 with unseen data, a root-mean-square error of 0.166 m, and an absolute average error less than 2%. These results allow dense and accurate reconstructions of the underwater profile in wide, muddy, shallow regions of the Bahía Blanca estuary, showing the feasibility of hyperspectral imagery combined with sonar data in turbid shallow waters."

Although there is much research about boresight calibration, there are not sufficient studies on the frequency of the calibration performance. The short-term stability of boresight misalignment was investigated in previous studies, but long-term stability research could not be done. It is important to emphasize that long-term stability is still open to questions. In this study, an Ultracam Eagle digital aerial camera's data from 2012 to 2016 were analyzed and the question of how often calibration should be performed was investigated. Boresight misalignment does not remain constant on a yearly basis and should be calibrated every year before the flight season. It was observed that the boresight misalignment changed dramatically when the inertial measurement unit or camera was removed from the aircraft and sent to the manufacturer for factory calibration."
Spectral Probability Distribution of Closed Connected Water and Remote Sensing Statistical Inference for Yellow Substance,"Zhu, Weining; Zhang, Zeliang; Yang, Zaiqiao; Pang, Shuna; Chen, Jiang; Cheng, Qian",pp. 807-819(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2021/00000087/00000011/art00009;jsessionid=7n3maj6flgcgs.x-ic-live-01,"Unlike traditional remote sensing inversion, this study proposes a new distribution–distribution scheme, which uses statistical inferences to estimate the probability distribution of in-water components based on the probability distribution of the observed spectra.

In this study, based on Landsat-8 images, we analyzed the spectral probability distributions of 688 global waters and found that many of them were normal, log normal, and exponential distributions with diverse patterns in distribution parameters such as the mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Using simulated and field-measured data, we propose a bootstrap-based distribution–distribution scheme and develop some simple remote sensing statistical inference models to estimate the distribution parameters of yellow substance in water."
A Method of Extracting High-Accuracy Elevation Control Points from ICESat-2 Altimetry Data,"Li, Binbin; Xie, Huan; Liu, Shijie; Tong, Xiaohua; Tang, Hong; Wang, Xu",pp. 821-830(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2021/00000087/00000011/art00010;jsessionid=7n3maj6flgcgs.x-ic-live-01,"Due to its high ranging accuracy, spaceborne laser altimetry technology can improve the accuracy of satellite stereo mapping without ground control points. In the past, full-waveformICE,CLOUD, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) laser altimeter data have been used as one of the main data sources for global elevation control. As a second-generation satellite,ICESat-2is equipped with an altimeter using photon counting mode. This can further improve the application capability for stereo mapping because of the six laser beams with high along-track repetition frequency, which can provide more detailed ground contour descriptions. Previous studies have addressed how to extract high-accuracy elevation control points fromICESatdata. However, these methods cannot be directly applied toICESat-2data because of the different modes of the laser altimeters. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method using comprehensive evaluation labels that can extract high-accuracy elevation control points that meet the different level elevation accuracy requirements for large scale mapping from theICESat-2land-vegetation along-track product. The method was verified using two airborne lidar data sets. In flat, hilly, and mountainous areas, by using our method to extract the terrain elevation, the root-mean-square error of elevation control points decrease from 1.249–2.094 m, 2.237–3.225 m, and 2.791–4.822 m to 0.262–0.429 m, 0.484–0.596 m, and 0.611–1.003 m, respectively. The results show that the extraction elevations meet the required accuracy for large scale mapping."

The method enables us to fill nearshore data voids in existing Kd data sets and provides a more direct measurement approach than methods based on passive multispectral satellite imagery. Furthermore, in contrast to other lidar-based methods, it does not rely on extensive signal processing or the availability of the system impulse response function, and it is designed to be applied globally rather than at a specific geographic location. The model was tested using Kd measurements from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite sensor at 94 coastal sites spanning the globe, with Kd values ranging from 0.05 to 3.6 m –1 . The results demonstrate the efficacy of the approach and serve as a benchmark for future machine-learning regression studies of turbidity usingICESat-2."

A semi-supervised version of the ensemble margin is at the core of this work. Some major challenges in ensemble learning are investigated using this paradigm in the difficult context of land cover classification: selecting the most informative instances to form an appropriate training set, and selecting the best ensemble members. The main contribution of this work lies in the explicit use of the ensemble margin as a decision method to select training data and base classifiers in an ensemble learning framework. The selection of training data is achieved through an innovative iterative guided bagging algorithm exploiting low-margin instances. The overall classification accuracy is improved by up to 3%, with more dramatic improvement in per-class accuracy (up to 12%). The selection of ensemble base classifiers is achieved by an ordering-based ensemble-selection algorithm relying on an original margin-based criterion that also targets low-margin instances. This method reduces the complexity (ensemble size under 30) but maintains performance."
Persistent Scatterer Interferometry for Pettimudi (India) Landslide Monitoring using Sentinel-1A Images,"Shankar, Hari; Roy, Arijit; Chauhan, Prakash",pp. 853-862(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2021/00000087/00000011/art00013;jsessionid=7n3maj6flgcgs.x-ic-live-01,"The continuous monitoring of land surface movement over time is of paramount importance for assessing landslide triggering factors and mitigating landslide hazards. This research focuses on measuring horizontal and vertical surface displacement due to a devastating landslide event in the west-facing slope of the Rajamala Hills, induced by intense rainfall. The landslide occurred in Pettimudi, a tea-plantation village of the Idukki district in Kerala, India, on August 6–7, 2020. The persistent-scatterer synthetic aperture radar interferometry (PSInSAR ) technique, along with the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS), was applied to investigate the land surface movement over time. A stack of 20 Sentinel-1A single-look complex images (19 interferograms) acquired in descending passes was used for PSInSAR processing. The line-of-sight (LOS ) displacement in long time series, and hence the average LOS velocity, was measured at each measurement-point location. The mean LOS velocity was decomposed into horizontal east–west (EW ) and vertical up–down velocity components. The results show that the mean LOS, EW, and up–down velocities in the study area, respectively, range from –18.76 to +11.88, –10.95 to +6.93, and –15.05 to +9.53 mm/y, and the LOS displacement ranges from –19.60 to +19.59 mm. The displacement values clearly indicate the instability of the terrain. The time-series LOS displacement trends derived from the applied PSInSAR technique are very useful for providing valuable inputs for disaster management and the development of disaster early-warning systems for the benefit of local residents."

Deriving reliable 3D coordinates from such UAVs is contingent on accurate geometric calibration, which encompasses the estimation of mounting parameters and synchronization errors. Through a rigorous impact analysis of such systematic errors, this article proposes a direct approach for spatial and temporal calibration (estimating system parameters through a bundle adjustment procedure) of a GNSS/INS -assisted pushbroom scanner onboard a UAV platform. The calibration results show that the horizontal and vertical accuracies are within the ground sampling distance of the sensor. Unlike for frame camera systems, this article also shows that the indirect approach is not a feasible solution for pushbroom scanners due to their limited ability for decoupling system parameters. This finding provides further support that the direct approach is recommended for spatial and temporal calibration of UAV pushbroom scanner systems."

The physical interpretation of the sources of rank deficiency is demonstrated using a case study to solve the problem of 3D line fitting, which is often encountered in geomatics but has not been addressed fully to date. Finally, some geomatics-related applications—mobile lidar system calibration, point cloud registration, and single-photo resection—are discussed along with respective experimental results, to emphasize the need to assessLSAmodels and their weight matrices to draw inferences regarding the effective contribution of observations. The discussion and results demonstrate the vast applications of this research in geomatics as well as other engineering domains."

Verification of the classification accuracy was conducted for the Midwestern United States. The following conclusions are drawn: The use of the random-forest algorithm is effective in estimating the mixed-pixel ratio, which leads to stable classification accuracy; the fusion of historical data and MODIS-derived crop phenology information provides much better crop classification accuracy than when these are used individually; and the input of a longer MODIS data period can improve classification accuracy, especially after day of year 279, because of improved estimation accuracy for the soybean emergence date."

First, a 3D rendering strategy is adopted to synthesize ground-view images from the 3D mesh model reconstructed from aerial images and overcome the global geometric distortion between aerial and ground images. We do not directly match feature points between the synthesized and ground images, but extract line-segment correspondences by designing a line-segment matching method that can adapt to the local geometric deformation, holes, and blurred textures on the synthesized image. Then, on the basis of the line-segment matches, local-region correspondences are constructed, and local regions on the synthesized image are propagated back to the original aerial images. Lastly, feature-point matching is performed between the aerial and ground images with the constraints of the local-region correspondences. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain more correct matches and higher matching precision than state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, the proposed method increases the average number of correct matches and average matching precision of the second-best method by more than five times and 40%, respectively."

Firstly, the thin plate spline function is iteratively applied to interpolate the reference surface. Secondly, gradually changing grid size and curvature threshold are used to construct hierarchical constraints. Finally, an adaptive height difference classifier based on the Gaussian mixture model is proposed. Using the latent variables obtained by the expectation-maximization algorithm, the posterior probability of each point is computed. As a result, ground and objects can be marked separately according to the calculated possibility. 15 data samples provided by the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing are used to verify the proposed method, which is also compared with eight classical filtering algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that the average total errors and average Cohen's kappa coefficient of the proposed method are 6.91% and 80.9%, respectively.

Imagery processed without ground control points (GCPs) had horizontal errors of 1.0–2.5 m; however, the errors had unequal variances, significant directional bias, and did not conform to the expected statistical distribution and so should be considered unreliable. WhenGCPswere used, horizontal errors decreased to less than 5 cm, and the errors had equal variances, directional uniformity, and they conformed to the expected distribution. The analysis identified a longitudinal bias in some of the reference data, which were subsequently excluded from the analysis. Had these data been retained, the estimates of positional accuracy would have been unreliable and inaccurate. These results strongly suggest that examiningGPSdata for bias should be a much more common practice."

Then it applies the double adaptive intensity-threshold method to extract road markings from road surfaces. Finally, it performs an adaptive spatial density filter based on the density distribution of point-cloud data to remove false road-marking points. The average completeness, correctness, and F measure of road-marking extraction are 0.827, 0.887, and 0.854, respectively, indicating that the proposed method is efficient and robust."

The aim of this study is to introduce a simple method to estimate SMC while synergistically using AMSR2 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements with a higher accuracy on a regional scale. Two MODIS products, including daily reflectance (MYD021) and nighttime land surface temperature (LST) products were used. In 2015, 1442 in situ SMC measurements from six stations in Iran were used as ground-truth data. Twenty models were evaluated using combinations of polarization index (PI), index of soil wetness (ISW), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and LST. The model revealed the best results using a quadratic combination of PI and ISW, a linear form of LST, and a constant value. The overall correlation coefficient, root-mean-square error, and mean absolute error were 0.59, 4.62%, and 3.01%, respectively."
Optimal Regularization Method Based on the L-Curve for Solving Rational Function Model Parameters,"Zhou, Guoqing; Yuan, Man; Li, Xiaozhu; Sha, Hongjun; Xu, Jiasheng; Song, Bo; Wang, Feng",pp. 661-668(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2021/00000087/00000009/art00014;jsessionid=558007tlvpqlu.x-ic-live-03,"Rational polynomial coefficients in a rational function model (RFM) have high correlation and redundancy, especially in high-orderRFMs, which results in ill-posed problems of the normal equation. For this reason, this article presents an optimal regularization method with the L-curve for solving rational polynomial coefficients. This method estimates the rational polynomial coefficients of anRFMusing the L-curve and finds the optimal regularization parameter with the minimum mean square error, then solves the parameters of theRFMby the Tikhonov method based on the optimal regularization parameter. The proposed method is validated in both terrain-dependent and terrain-independent cases using Gaofen-1 and aerial images, respectively, and compared with the least-squares method, L-curve method, and generalized cross-validation method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can solve theRFMparameters effectively, and their accuracy is increased by more than 85% on average relative to the other methods."
Scene-Change Detection Based on Multi-Feature-Fusion Latent Dirichlet Allocation Model for High-Spatial-Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery,"Li, Xiaoman; Zhong, Yanfei; Su, Yu; Ye, Richen",pp. 669-681(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2021/00000087/00000009/art00015;jsessionid=558007tlvpqlu.x-ic-live-03,"With the continuous development of high-spatial-resolution ground observation technology, it is now becoming possible to obtain more and more high-resolution images, which provide us with the possibility to understand remote sensing images at the semantic level. Compared with traditional pixel- and object-oriented methods of change detection, scene-change detection can provide us with land use change information at the semantic level, and can thus provide reliable information for urban land use change detection, urban planning, and government management. Most of the current scene-change detection methods are based on the visual-words expression of the bag-of-visual-words model and the single-feature-based latent Dirichlet allocation model. In this article, a scene-change detection method for high-spatial-resolution imagery is proposed based on a multi-feature-fusion latent Dirich- let allocation model. This method combines the spectral, textural, and spatial features of the high-spatial-resolution images, and the final scene expression is realized through the topic features extracted from the more abstract latent Dirichlet allocation model. Post-classification comparison is then used to detect changes in the scene images at different times. A series of experiments demonstrates that, compared with the traditional bag-of-words and topic models, the proposed method can obtain superior scene-change detection results."

These observations have substantially enhanced our understanding of the Earth's terrestrial dynamics, both as a major element of the Earth's physical system, the primary home of humans, and the major source of resources that support them. The history of Landsat is complex, reflective of the human systems that sustain it. Despite the conflicted perspectives surrounding the continuation of the program, Landsat has survived based on worldwide recognition of its critical contributions to understanding land dynamics, management of natural resources and Earth system science. Launch of Landsat 9 is anticipated in Fall 2021, and current planning for the next generation, Landsat Next is well underway.

Spinor-Based Attitude Determination with Star Sensor Considering Depth,"Sheng, Qinghong; Ren, Rui; Xu, Weilan; Xiao, Hui; Wang, Bo; Hong, Ran",pp. 551-556(6),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2021/00000087/00000008/art00009;jsessionid=hxwj92064v9m.x-ic-live-01,"A star sensor is a high-precision satellite attitude measurement device. Since its observation information has only two-dimensional direction vectors, when a star sensor is used for attitude determination the dimension of the observation information is less than the number of attitude angles determined, so mainstream algorithms usually only guarantee the accuracy of the pitch angle and the roll angle. In view of the lack of depth information in the observation's imaging geometric condition, this article proposes a spinor-based attitude determination model, which describes a straight line passing through two stars with the spinor and maps the depth information of the straight line with the pitch, to establish an imaging geometry model of the spinor coplanar condition. Experiments show that the yaw-angle attitude accuracy of the method is an order of magnitude better than that of mainstream algorithms, and the accuracy of the three attitude angles reaches the arc-second level."

Remote sensing technology plays a vital role in facilitating data generation pertaining to various urban applications. Digital surface models represent the elevation of the earth surface features, and can be obtained from stereo images, radar, laser scanning, and so on. Photogrammetric techniques applied to optical stereo satellite images are economical and fast ways to generate height information of buildings. In this work, a quantitative and qualitative analysis of digital surface models generated from Cartosat-1 stereo images is compared with openly available data. The study finds that it is possible to acquire about 50 percent of building heights with acceptable error limits. The experimental results indicate that the quality of height information is suitable for applications to assess urban development at a macro scale, but not for individual building-level modeling."

In this study, we propose an enhanced topographic mapping method based on multiple stereo images taken at the same rover location with changing illumination conditions. Key steps of the method include dense matching of stereo images, 3D point-cloud generation, point-cloud co-registration, and fusion. The final point cloud has more complete coverage and more details of the terrain than that conventionally generated from a single stereo pair. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by experiments using the Yutu-2 rover, in which two data sets were acquired by the navigation cameras at two locations and under changing illumination conditions. This method, which does not involve complex operations, has great potential for application in planetary-rover and lander missions."

However, supervised deep learning representation methods need a considerable amount of labeled data to capture class-specific features, limiting the application of deep learning-based methods while there are a few labeled training samples. An unsupervised deep learning representation, high-resolution remote sensing image scene classification method is proposed in this work to address this issue. The proposed method, called contrastive learning, narrows the distance between positive views: color channels belonging to the same images widens the gaps between negative view pairs consisting of color channels from different images to obtain class-specific data representations of the input data without any supervised information. The classifier uses extracted features by the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based feature extractor with labeled information of training data to set space of each category and then, using linear regression, makes predictions in the testing procedure. Comparing with existing unsupervised deep learning representation high-resolution remote sensing image scene classification methods, contrastive learning CNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on three different scale benchmark data sets: small scale RSSCN7 data set, midscale aerial image data set, and large-scale NWPU-RESISC45 data set."

The data set produced in this work can better train our network model and realize point cloud reconstruction based on a single picture of the real world. Finally, the constructed point cloud data correspond well to the corresponding three-dimensional shapes, and to a certain extent, the disadvantage of the uneven distribution of the point cloud data obtained by light detection and ranging scanning is overcome using the proposed method."
A Unified Framework of Bundle Adjustment and Feature Matching for High-Resolution Satellite Images,"Ling, Xiao; Huang, Xu; Qin, Rongjun",pp. 485-490(6),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2021/00000087/00000007/art00010;jsessionid=5jgs8mtm6lipe.x-ic-live-01,"Bundle adjustment (BA) is a technique for refining sensor orientations of satellite images, while adjustment accuracy is correlated with feature matching results. Feature matching often contains high uncertainties in weak/repeat textures, while BA results are helpful in reducing these uncertainties. To compute more accurate orientations, this article incorporates BA and feature matching in a unified framework and formulates the union as the optimization of a global energy function so that the solutions of the BA and feature matching are constrained with each other. To avoid a degeneracy in the optimization, we propose a comprised solution by breaking the optimization of the global energy function into two-step suboptimizations and compute the local minimums of each suboptimization in an incremental manner. Experiments on multi-view high-resolution satellite images show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art orientation techniques with or without accurate least-squares matching."

Our experimental results indicated that convolutional neural networks achieved the better performance with an overall accuracy of 98.32%, Kappa coefficient of 0.98, and Macro F1 of 98.28%, and the farmland was replaced by IS from 2001 to 2017, and the IS area (ISA) increased by 51.24 km2; that is, the growth rate was up to 13.8% in sixteen years. According to the landscape metrics, the IS expanded and agglomerated into large patches from small fragmented ones. In addition, the gross domestic product change of the secondary industry was similar to the change of ISA between 2001 and 2017. Thus, the spatiotemporal evolution of IS was associated with the economic development of the Chengdu urban area in the past sixteen years."
Optimizing the Segmentation of a High-Resolution Image by Using a Local Scale Parameter,"Zhang, Lei; Liu, Hongchao; Li, Xiaosong; Qian, Xinyu",pp. 503-511(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2021/00000087/00000007/art00012;jsessionid=5jgs8mtm6lipe.x-ic-live-01,"Image segmentation is a critical procedure in object-based identification and classification of remote sensing data. However, optimal scale-parameter selection presents a challenge, given the presence of complex landscapes and uncertain feature changes. This study proposes a local optimal segmentation approach that considers both intersegment heterogeneity and intrasegment homogeneity, uses the standard deviation and local Moran's index to explore each optimal segment across different scale parameters, and combines the optimal segments into a single layer. The optimal segment is measured by using high-spatial-resolution images. Results show that our approach out-performs and generates less error than the global optimal segmentation approach. The variety of land cover types or intrasegment homogeneity leads to segment matching with the geo-objects on different scales. Local optimal segmentation demonstrates sensitivity to land cover discrepancy and provides good performance on cross-scale segmentation."

Hence, we aimed to summarize the most relevant urban spectral indices by focusing on multispectral, thermal, and nighttime lights indices. We use the search terms ""urban index"", ""built-up index"", ""normalized difference built-up area (NDBI )"", ""impervious surface index"", and ""spectral urban index"" to collect relevant literature from the ""Web of Science Core Collection"" database. We found that all urban spectral indices developed since 2003, except NDBI. This review will help understand the applications of urban spectral indices, the selection of indices based on available spectral bands, and their merits and demerits."

However, the consistency of land cover monitoring is limited by the spatial and temporal resolutions of the acquired satellite images. The public availability of daily high-resolution images is still scarce. This paper aims to fill this gap by proposing a novel spatiotemporal fusion method to enhance daily low spatial resolution land cover mapping using a weakly supervised deep convolutional neural network. We merge Sentinel images and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS )-derived thematic land cover maps under the application background of massive remote sensing data and the large spatial resolution gaps between MODIS data and Sentinel images. The neural network training was conducted on the public data set SEN12MS, while the validation and testing used ground truth data from the 2020 IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society data fusion contest. The proposed data fusion method shows that the synthesized land cover map has significantly higher spatial resolution than the corresponding MODIS-derived land cover map. The ensemble approach can be implemented for generating high-resolution time series of satellite images by fusing fine images from Sentinel-1 and -2 and daily coarse images from MODIS."

This evaluation method was verified in Zoige County, China, by using remote sensing data to evaluate ecological functions and human activity interference in the ecological redline area for an urban environment.

To accurately filter out buildings and preserve terrain, we propose a DEM filtering algorithm using building segmentation results of orthophoto. Based on morphological filtering, our method estimates the probability of being a built-up area or mountains for DSM, and according to this probability the filtering parameters are adaptively adjusted. For robustness, our method performs the above filtering operation on DSM through a sliding-window approach, and finally the nonground points are determined by the votes of multiple filtering. Experiments against six representative data sets have shown that our method achieved superior perfor- mance than classical algorithms and commercial software."

To solve this problem, we propose a combined unmixing framework to extract impervious surface in nonshadow and shadow areas, using linear and nonlinear unmixing models, respectively. First shadow is separated from nonshadow. Then a nonlinear unmixing method is selected to map impervious surface in shadow, which is more suitable to the complex imaging environment in shadow, and a classic linear unmixing model in nonshadow. Through experimental tests, the proposed combined unmixing framework is shown to effectively reduce error in two study areas compared with classical unmixing methods."

The chlorophyll fluorescence plays a very important role in vegetation remote sensing, and the polarization information in vegetation remote sensing has become an effective way to characterize the physical characteristics of vegetation. This study analyzes the difference between these three types of radiation flux and utilizes polarization radiation to separate them from the apparent radiation of the vegetation canopy. Specifically, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence is extracted from vegetation canopy radiation data using standard Fraunhofer-line discrimination. The results show that polarization measurements can quantitatively separate Lvol, Lpol, and ChlF and extract the solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence. This study improves our understanding of the light-scattering properties of vegetation canopies and provides insights for developing building models and research algorithms."

The data sets have significant variations in quality, quantity, and data type. A correlation analysis verifies that the proposed measures can successfully rank the quality of heterogeneous training data sets prior to the image classification task. In this era of big data, pre-classification quality assessment measures empower research scientists to select suitable data sets for classification tasks from available open data sources. Research findings prove the versatility of the Euclidean spectral distance function to develop quality metrics for assessing open-source training data sets with varying characteristics for urban area classification."

Hyperspectral data are increasingly being considered for exploring levels of urbanization, due to their capability to capture the spectral variability that a modern urban landscape offers. Data and algorithms are two sides of a coin: while the data capture the variations, the algorithms provide suitable methods to extract relevant information. The literature reports a variety of algorithms for extraction of urban information from any given data, with varying accuracies. This article aims to explore the binary-classifier approach to target detection to extract certain features. Roads and roofs are the most common features present in any urban scene. These experiments were conducted on a subset of AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral data from the Udaipur region of India, with roads and roofs as targets. Four categories of target-detection algorithms are identified from a literature survey and our previous experience—distance measures, angle-based measures, information measures, and machine-learning measures—followed by performance evaluation. The article also presents a brief taxonomy of algorithms; explores methods such as the Mahalanobis angle, which has been reported to be effective for extraction of urban targets; and explores newer machine-learning algorithms to increase accuracy. This work is likely to aid in city planning, sustainable development, and various other governmental and nongovernmental efforts related to urbanization."

A deep learning approach is adopted to automatically extract two-dimensional (2D) human body features, which are then converted to 3D features based on photogrammetric processing, including dense image matching and triangulation. The multi-threading scheme and GPU-acceleration enable real-time acquisition and monitoring of 3D human body kinematics. Experimental analysis verified that the system processing rate reached ∼18 frames per second. The effective detection distance reached 15 m, with a geometric accuracy of better than 1% of the distance within a range of 12 m.

Most research has focused on extracting the ground and the canopy photons in vegetated areas. Yet the extraction of the ground photons from urban areas, where the vegetation is mixed with artificial constructions, has not been fully investigated. This article proposes a new method to estimate the ground surface elevations in urban areas. The ICES at-2 signal photons were detected by the improved Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise algorithm and the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System algorithm. The Advanced Land Observing Satellite-1 PALSAR –derived digital surface model has been utilized to separate the terrain surface from the ICES at-2 data. A set of ground-truth data was used to evaluate the accuracy of these two methods, and the achieved accuracy was up to 2.7 cm, which makes our method effective and accurate in determining the ground elevation in urban scenes."
A Novel Class-Specific Object-Based Method for Urban Change Detection Using High-Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery,"Bai, Ting; Sun, Kaimin; Li, Wenzhuo; Li, Deren; Chen, Yepei; Sui, Haigang",pp. 249-262(14),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2021/00000087/00000004/art00008;jsessionid=f4ldtbaho82bm.x-ic-live-01,"A single-scale object-based change-detection classifier can distinguish only global changes in land cover, not the more granular and local changes in urban areas. To overcome this issue, a novel class-specific object-based change-detection method is proposed. This method includes three steps: class-specific scale selection, class-specific classifier selection, and land cover change detection. The first step combines multi-resolution segmentation and a random forest to select the optimal scale for each change type in land cover. The second step links multi-scale hierarchical sampling with a classifier such as random forest, support vector machine, gradient-boosting decision tree, or Adaboost; the algorithm automatically selects the optimal classifier for each change type in land cover. The final step employs the optimal classifier to detect binary changes and from-to changes for each change type in land cover. To validate the proposed method, we applied it to two high-resolution data sets in urban areas and compared the change-detection results of our proposed method with that of principal component analysis k-means, object-based change vector analysis, and support vector machine. The experimental results show that our proposed method is more accurate than the other methods. The proposed method can address the high levels of complexity found in urban areas, although it requires historical land cover maps as auxiliary data."

In this method, roofs are first extracted from UAV images using a depth-channel improved UNet model. A two-step change detection scheme is then implemented for PIC detection. In the change detection stage, roofs with appearance, disappearance, and shape changes are first extracted by morphological analysis. Subroof primitives are then obtained by roof-constrained image segmentation within the remaining roof areas, and object-based iteratively reweighted multivariate alteration detection (IR-MAD ) is implemented to extract the small PICs from the subroof primitives. The proposed method organically combines deep learning and object-based image analysis, which can identify entire roof changes and locate small object changes within the roofs. Experiments show that the proposed method has better accuracy compared with the other counterparts, including the original IR-MAD, change vector analysis, and principal components analysis-K-means."

In this article, a detector for sky full-polarization imaging detection is described, the major error-influencing factors (MEIFS ) are obtained, and the error propagation is modeled and analyzed. We reveal the relationship between the error of the inversed Stokes vector and the condition number of the detector matrix, which shows that the error of the inversed Stokes vector is affected by the Stokes vector of the incident light itself and the MEIFS together, with the MEIFS playing a decisive role. With the MEIFS optimized, the impact of detector error on the inversed Stokes vector is attenuated. A control equation for system calibration is also deduced which can establish the connection between the detector matrix design and calibration process. The work in this article provides a reference for optimization and calibration of sky full-polarization imaging detectors."

We comprehensively evaluate the current mainstream method on the RueMonge 2014 data set and demonstrate the superiority of our method. The mean intersection-over-union index on the facade-parsing task reached 76.41%, which is 2.75% higher than the current best result.

In this study, a method of scene classification for remotely sensed images based on pretrained densely connected convolutional neural networks combined with an ensemble classifier is proposed to tackle the under-utilization of local and spatial information for image classification. Specifically, we first exploit the pretrained DenseNet and fine-tuned it to release its potential in remote-sensing image feature representation. Second, a spatial-pyramid structure and an improved Fisher-vector coding strategy are leveraged to further strengthen representation capability and the robustness of the feature map captured from convolutional layers. Then we integrate an ensemble classifier in our network architecture considering that lower attention to feature descriptors. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the proposed method achieves superior performance on UC Merced, AID, and NWPU-RESISC45 data sets."

Using optical images alone to extract IS is usually limited by weather, which obliges us to develop new data sources. The obvious differences between natural and artificial targets in interferometric synthetic-aperture radar coherence images have attracted the attention of researchers. A few studies have attempted to use coherence images to extract IS—mostly single-temporal coherence images, which are affected by de-coherence factors. And due to speckle, the results are rather fragmented. In this study, we used time-series coherence images and introduced multi-resolution segmentation as a postprocessing step to extract IS. From our experiments, the results from the proposed method were more complete and achieved considerable accuracy, confirming the potential of time-series coherence images for extracting IS."

We used object-based feature extraction algorithms for detection of road networks from a high resolution Cartosat-2F multispectral data in an Indian city with varying terrain conditions ranging from a compact built-up area to a predominantly vegetated area. The approach involves multi-resolution segmentation (MRS ) and spectral difference segmentation (SDS ) followed by road extraction using fuzzy rule-based algorithm based on various object features, viz. gray-level co-occurrence matrix homogeneity, density, rectangular fit, etc. With overall accuracies ranging from 77.46% to 92% SDS approach performed better than MRS which could afford 60.46% to 75.0% only. However, both of these approaches score over the classical Gaussian maximum likelihood classifier which could register only 50.0% to 68.0% overall accuracy. Furthermore, the maximum overall accuracy was obtained in compact built-up site (85% to 92%) followed by sparsely built-up site (75.0% to 88%) and predominantly vegetated site (60.46% to 77.14%)."

This paper proposes a new method to correct errors in DSM or/and refine an existing coarse DSM. The method employs the concept of projected images together with some image matching techniques to correct/ refine the affected regions in DSM. Since projected images are used, the proposed method can greatly simplify the complicated coordinate transformations and pixel resampling; therefore, the errors/artifacts in DSM can be amended more efficiently and accurately. Several experiments demonstrate the practical usefulness of the proposed method under some scenarios, and some potential improvements are also pointed out to accommodate the various needs during refining DSM."

Although there are no substantive figures for desirable levels of green spaces in urban areas for the benefit of inhabitants, the paper proposes minimum desirable areal percentages. The paper defines natural capital and ES and the procedures adopted by researchers in balancing the supply and demand for ES for urban areas. The genuine progress indicator is presented as a measure of assessing human welfare, but it is not pursued as an indicator of sustainability. Examples of the applications of remote sensing technologies for determining supply and demand of ES are reviewed as are the potential of the supply and demand of ES to support decision-making in urban areas, to ensure that development decisions are sustainable and are in the best interests of the urban residents who depend on ES for their life support."

The results show that NTL radiance generally decreased during the epidemic. Despite the fact that increased NTL radiance was observed after lifting the lockdown, it was still lower than normal, indicating that socioeconomic activities have been largely resumed but the production scale has not been fully restored, and the decrease in nitrogen dioxide concentration verified this phenomenon. We find that central urban areas and distant suburban areas present different modes of NTL radiance variation. We further observed a decrease in NTL radiance from different urban functional areas, including industrial parks, airports, business districts, loop lines, and residential area, that corresponds to the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on both industrial production and the service sector."

The proposed method comprises five steps: selection of seed points, connection and slope analysis, increasing the seed points, construction of the TIN model of the seed points, and an iterative construction of the final TIN. Seven data sets from the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing Working Group are used to test whether the proposed method can preserve discontinuities of landscapes and reduce omission and total errors by an average of 9% and 5%, respectively; achieving such results can reduce the amount of workload required for result modification during posttreatment, thus decreasing costs."

The ISRI was then validated for threshold simulation, separability, and correlation analysis. Results demonstrated that ISRI had a good performance for ISA mapping in four cities in China with different geographic environments, with all extraction accuracies all above 90%. ISRI had a high separability between ISA and soil and was better than other indices (normalized difference built-up index and biophysical composition index). Further, ISRI has a close relationship with the ISA proportion. Therefore, ISRI would be a simple and reliable index for urban ISA mapping."

We investigate three-, four-, and eight-band multispectral inputs to the FCNN. Resulting maps are promising in both qualitative and quantitative assessment when compared to automated land use/land cover products. Accuracy was assessed by F1 and average precision (AP) scores, as well as receiver operating characteristic curves, with area under the curve (AUC ) used as an additional accuracy metric.

To address this deficiency, we propose an improved three-dimensional displacement inversion model based on symmetry characteristics (imDIMSC) of a mining subsidence basin by the stacking technology of multiple single-track InSAR pairs. In this study, both field-observed surface displacement and simulated data were applied to calibrate and validate the proposed imDIMSC model.

Comparison of the field-observed data, the proposed methodology, and the imDIMSC model provided significantly more accurate 3D displacement estimations."

In this operation, various window sizes are specified, and the mean is obtained at each size. The points that are above the mean are saved and divided by the number of windows to obtain the proportion. Points are considered non-ground if their proportion is higher than the assigned threshold, and otherwise ground. An algorithm for classifying the obtained nonground point cloud into buildings and trees is also illustrated in this article. First the nonground points are labeled, then each label is tested individually. The process begins with segmenting each label. Then comes testing of whether each segment of points can be fitted within a specific plane. The label of the point cloud is considered a building if the number of segments considered as planes is larger than those considered as nonplanes; otherwise it is classified as a tree."

On one hand, no ground control points are visible due to heavy canopy. While on the other hand, precise georeferencing relies on ground control. As an alternative, we propose to use an available digital elevation model (DEM ) as control. The mathematical framework minimizes the difference between the lidar DEM and the reference DEM. Our solution consists of two steps: initial optimization to find reliable ground points through iterative filtering and georeferencing, and fine optimization to achieve precise georeferencing and lidar system calibration. Through this approach, the wave-form-derived DEM can best fit the reference DEM, with a mean of 0.937 m and standard deviation of 0.792 m, while the time-synchronization offset and boresight angles are simultaneously determined, i.e., self-calibrated. This development provides a novel georeferencing approach with self-calibration for lidar data without using conventional ground control points."

However, the use of such assumptions causes error and reduces the accuracy of registration. The aim of this article is to present a methodology based on a quasi-observation assumption in the mathematical equations in the process of georeferencing. Experimental results for IKONOS and GeoEye images over two different cities of Iran indicate that the quasi-observation assumption can increase the average registration accuracy up to 48.96% and 24.77% using 3D-affine and rational function models, respectively. This improvement in accuracy increases the processing time by 31.48% over traditional approaches; however, the proposed methodology can be regarded as an efficient solution."

Current simulations only consider single Rayleigh scattering of water molecules and ignore multiple Mie scattering of suspended particles. In this study, a method based on a combination of Monte Carlo numerical simulation and Mie scattering theory is used to establish a model of the turbid underwater polarization distribution. Stokes vector and Mueller matrix are used to simulate the underwater polarization patterns within Snell's window. The distribution patterns and dynamic changes of the simulation are consistent with field measurements. The maximum depth that the polarization pattern can be maintained is calculated for different water types. The influence of water turbidity on polarization patterns is discussed.

Polarization of Light Reflected by Grass: Modeling Using Visible-Sunlit Areas,"Yang, Bin; Yan, Lei; Liu, Siyuan",pp. 745-752(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2020/00000086/00000012/art00011;jsessionid=3t7kdhte357s5.x-ic-live-02,"The Bidirectional polarization distribution function (BPDF) of land surfaces is important for studies of land surfaces and aerosol. With the availability of a huge number of polarization measurements, several semi-empirical BPDF models have been proposed. However, these models do not pay much attention to canopy structure, which is fundamental for generation of polarization. In this article, we propose a new BPDF model using canopy structure information, which is parameterized by visible-sunlit areas. It is evaluated over grassland using POLDER BPDF and MODIS leaf area index data sets. Experiments suggest that compared to Nadal–Bréon and Litvinov models, the new BPDF model reduces root-mean-square error by 7% and 10%, respectively. The new BPDF model also provides better performance when it is fitted using observations clustered by sun zenith angle. The new BPDF model thus provides an effective tool for the study of land surface polarization."

Optimal Demodulation Algorithm of Spatially Modulated Full-Polarization Imaging System,"Zhang, Ziyang; Ye, Song; Li, Shu; Zhang, Yuting; Zhang, Wentao; Wang, Jiejun; Wang, Xinqiang; Wang, Fangyuan",pp. 761-766(6),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2020/00000086/00000012/art00013;jsessionid=3t7kdhte357s5.x-ic-live-02,"Spatially modulated full-polarization imaging systems can obtain full Stokes parameter information by single imaging, with strong characteristics of real-time execution and stability. Since all the polarization information is modulated into an interferogram, demodulation becomes an essential step. As the resolution of the obtained image continuously increases, the data to be calculated also increase. Therefore, a higher speed for the demodulation process is requisite. This article proposes a local filtering method and bypasses the frequency centralization method in the frequency domain to improve the speed of demodulation. The demodulation time of an interferogram of size 1024×1024 pixels was reduced from 3.027 473 s to 0.134 637 s, increasing the speed of demodulation by 97.72%. Meanwhile, the demodulation time of an interferogram of size 6144×6144 pixels was reduced from 444.329 92 s to 4.637 069 s, increasing the speed of demodulation by 98.75%."
Sensitive Research of Scattering and Absorbing Aerosols on Sky Polarization Pattern,"Chen, Wei; Song, Ge; Wang, Haozhong; Zhao, Haimeng; Zhu, Jianfang; Zhong, Peiyi",pp. 767-774(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2020/00000086/00000012/art00014;jsessionid=3t7kdhte357s5.x-ic-live-02,"Sky polarization patterns are a relatively new and interesting field of polarized remote sensing. However, most current research mainly focuses on Rayleigh scattering or different conditions of aerosol optical depth. In this study, the sky downward polarization patterns are calculated for both degree of linear polarization and angle of polarization with scattering and absorbing aerosol situations. When coarse-mode aerosol changes from scattering to absorbing, the decreasing trend in the sky downward degree-of-linear-polarization largely slows down when aerosol optical depth increases. For fine-mode aerosol, on the other hand, the change of pattern is not sensitive to the absorbing property of aerosol. Sky downward angle-of-polarization patterns for different levels of aerosol optical depth and aerosol modes are similar, with little change. The results suggest that in order to accurately use sky polarization for remote sensing or bionic navigation, it is necessary to characterize aerosol microphysical properties first, especially when coarse absorbing aerosol exists."

This region has been used to validate geological interpretations of airborne hyperspectral imagery (AVIRIS HSI ), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER ) imagery, and most recently eight-band WorldView-3 shortwave infrared (SWIR ) imagery. WorldView-3 is a high-spatial-resolution commercial multispectral satellite sensor with eight visible-to-near-infrared (VNIR ) bands (0.42–1.04 μm) and eight SWIR bands (1.2–2.33 μm). We have applied mineral mapping techniques to all 16 bands to perform a geological analysis of the Cuprite, Nevada, location. Ground truth for the training and validation was derived from AVIRIS hyperspectral data and United States Geological Survey mineral spectral data for this location.

Our results show that with good ground truth, WorldView-3 SWIR + VNIR imagery produces an accurate geological assessment."

Uncertainty of Forested Wetland Maps Derived from Aerial Photography,"Prisley, Stephen P.; Turner, Jeffery A.; Brown, Mark J.; Schilling, Erik; Lambert, Samuel G.",pp. 609-617(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2020/00000086/00000010/art00009;jsessionid=1q28ddewuzxos.x-ic-live-02,"Forested wetlands (FWs) are economically and environmentally important, so monitoring of change is done using remote sensing by several U.S. federal programs. To better understand classification and delineation uncertainties in FW maps, we assessed agreement between National Wetlands Inventory maps based on aerial photography and field determinations at over 16 000 Forest Inventory and Analysis plots. Analyses included evaluation of temporal differences and spatial uncertainty in plot locations and wetland boundaries. User's accuracy for the wetlands map was 90% for FW and 68% for nonforested wetlands. High levels of false negatives were observed, with less than 40% of field-identified wetland plots mapped as such. Epsilon band analysis indicated that if delineation of FW boundaries in the southeastern U.S. met the data quality standards (5 meters), then the area within uncertainty bounds accounts for 15% to 30% of estimated FW area."
Weighted Spherical Sampling of Point Clouds for Forested Scenes,"Fafard, Alex; Kargar, Ali Rouzbeh; van Aardt, Jan",pp. 619-625(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2020/00000086/00000010/art00010;jsessionid=1q28ddewuzxos.x-ic-live-02,"Terrestrial laser scanning systems are characterized by a sampling pattern which varies in point density across the hemisphere. Additionally, close objects are over-sampled relative to objects that are farther away. These two effects compound to potentially bias the three-dimensional statistics of measured scenes. Previous methods of sampling have resulted in a loss of structural coherence. In this article, a method of sampling is proposed to optimally sample points while preserving the structure of a scene. Points are sampled along a spherical coordinate system, with probabilities modulated by elevation angle and squared distance from the origin. The proposed approach is validated through visual comparison and stem-volume assessment in a challenging mangrove forest in Micronesia. Compared to several well-known sampling techniques, the proposed approach reduces sampling bias and shows strong performance in stem-reconstruction measurement. The proposed sampling method matched or exceeded the stem-volume measurement accuracy across a variety of tested decimation levels. On average it achieved 3.0% higher accuracy at estimating stem volume than the closest competitor. This approach shows promise for improving the evaluation of terrestrial laser-scanning data in complex scenes."
Redefining the Directional-Hemispherical Reflectance and Transmittance of Needle-Shaped Leaves to Address Issues in Their Existing Measurement Methods,"Wang, Jun; Chen, Jing M.; Feng, Lian; Xu, Jianhui; Zhang, Feifei",pp. 627-641(15),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2020/00000086/00000010/art00011;jsessionid=1q28ddewuzxos.x-ic-live-02,"The directional-hemispherical reflectance and transmittance of needle-shaped leaves are redefined in this study. We suggest that the reflected and transmitted radiation of a leaf should be distinguished by the illuminated and shaded leaf surfaces rather than the usual separation of the two hemispheres by a plane perpendicular to the incoming radiation. Through theoretical analysis, we found that needle directional-hemispherical reflectance and transmittance measured by two existing techniques, namely Daughtry's method and Harron's method, could be significantly biased. This finding was proved by ray-tracing simulations intuitively as well as by inversions of thePROSPECTmodel indirectly. We propose the following requirements for needle spectral measurement in an integrating sphere: needles should be fully exposed to the light source, the interfusion of reflected and transmitted radiation on convex needle surfaces should be avoided, and multiple scattering of radiation among needles should be minimized."

Conventional methods for macrotexture measurement are either expensive, time-consuming, or of poor repeatability. Based on multi-view smartphone images collected in situ, this paper develops and evaluates an affordable and convenient alternative approach for pavement macrotexture measurement. Photogrammetric computer vision techniques are first applied to create high resolution point clouds of the pavement. Analytics are then developed to determine the macrotexture metric: mean profile depth by using the image-based point clouds. Experiments are carried out with 790 images over 25 spots on three state routes and six spots at an Indiana Department of Transportation test site. We demonstrate multi-view smartphone images can yield results comparable to the ones from the conventional laser texture scanner. It is expected that the developed approach can be adopted for large scale operational uses."

The presence of a heliport on an image usually implies an important facility, such as military facilities. Therefore, detection of heliports can reveal critical information about the content of an image. In this article, two learning-based algorithms are presented that make use of artificial neural networks to detect H-shaped, light-colored heliports. The first algorithm is based on shape analysis of the heliport candidate segments using classical artificial neural networks. The second algorithm uses deep-learning techniques. While deep learning can solve difficult problems successfully, classical-learning approaches can be tuned easily to obtain fast and reasonable results. Therefore, although the main objective of this article is heliport detection, it also compares a deep-learning based approach with a classical learning-based approach and discusses advantages and disadvantages of both techniques."

Taguchi optimization was applied to search optimal parameters using the plateau objective function (POF) and quality rate (Qr) as fitness criteria. Analysis of variance was also used to estimate the contributions of the parameters for POF and Qr, separately. The scale parameter was the most effective one, with contribution levels of 87.45% and 56.87% for POF and Qr, respectively. Linear regression and support-vector regression methods were used to predict the results of the experiment. Test results revealed that Taguchi optimization was more effective than linear regression and support-vector regression for predicting POF and Qr values."

A probabilistic method combining the circular shape information with the knowledge of the local maxima in the DSM has been used for the detection of the candidate trees. An active contour is applied within each detected region to extract the borders of the objects. Thereafter, all extracted objects are seamlessly divided into clusters considering a new feature data set formed by (1) the properties of trees, (2) planting parameters, and (3) neighborhood relations. This original clustering stage has led to two new contributions: (1) particular objects or clustered structures having distinctive characters and relationships other than the citrus objects can be identified and eliminated, and (2) the information revealed by clustering can be used to recover missing citrus objects within and/or nearby each cluster. The main finding of this research is that a successful clustering can provide valuable input for identifying incorrect and missing information in terms of citrus tree extraction. The proposed strategy is validated in eight test sites selected from the northern part of Mersin province of Turkey. The results achieved are also compared with the state-of-the-art methods developed for tree extraction, and the success of the proposed unified strategy is clearly highlighted."

In addition to the confusion matrix–derived accuracy measures (overall accuracy, kappa coefficient, F-scores), the performances of the algorithms were analyzed in detail considering three diversity measures (Q statistics, correlations, and interrater agreements) and a kappa-error diagram. Results showed that the highest classification accuracies (87% for IP, 94% for PU, and 93% for KSC data sets) were achieved with the use of CCF algorithm, and improvements in classification accuracy were statistically significant compared to RF and RoF. Based on the diversity measures and the kappa-error diagram, individual learners in the CCF ensemble were found to be more diverse and accurate."

The learning success of an AE is too sensitive for a training algorithm. The problem of hyperspectral image (HSI) classification by using spectral features of pixels is a highly complex problem due to its multi-dimensional and excessive data nature. In this paper, the contribution of three gradient-based training algorithms (i.e., scaled conjugate gradient (SCG), gradient descent (GD), and resilient backpropagation algorithms (RP)) on the solution of the HSI classification problem by using AE was analyzed. Also, it was investigated how neighborhood component analysis affects classification performance for training algorithms on HSIs. Two hyperspectral image classification benchmark data sets were used in the experimental analysis. Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicates that RB is statistically better than SCG and GD in solving the related image classification problem."

Study on Global Burned Forest Areas Based on Landsat Data,"Zhang, Zhaoming; Long, Tengfei; He, Guojin; Wei, Mingyue; Tang, Chao; Wang, Wei; Wang, Guizhou; She, Wenqing; Zhang, Xiaomei",pp. 503-508(6),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2020/00000086/00000008/art00012;jsessionid=qelt9si00inu.x-ic-live-03,"Forests are an extremely valuable natural resource for human development. Satellite remote sensing technology has been widely used in global and regional forest monitoring and management. Accurate data on forest degradation and disturbances due to forest fire is important to understand forest ecosystem health and forest cover conditions. For a long time, satellite-based global burned area products were only available at coarse native spatial resolution, which was difficult for detecting small and highly fragmented fires. In order to analyze global burned forest areas at finer spatial resolution, in this study a novel, multi-year 30 meter resolution global burned forest area product was generated and released based on Landsat time series data. Statistics indicate that in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2018 the total area of burned forest land in the world was 94.14 million hm2, 96.65 million hm2, 59.52 million hm2, 76.42 million hm2, and 83.70 million hm2, respectively, with an average value of 82.09 million hm2. Spatial distribution patterns of global burned forest areas were investigated across different continents and climatic domains. It was found that burned forest areas were mainly distributed in Africa and Oceania, which accounted for approximately 73.85% and 6.81% of the globe, respectively. By climatic domain, the largest burned forest areas occurred in the tropics, with proportions between 88.44% and 95.05% of the world's total during the study period. Multi-year dynamic analysis shows the global burned forest areas varied considerably due to global climate anomalies, e.g., the La Niña phenomenon."
Mapping Understory Invasive Plants in Urban Forests with Spectral and Temporal Unmixing of Landsat Imagery,"Singh, Kunwar K.; Gray, Josh",pp. 509-518(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2020/00000086/00000008/art00013;jsessionid=qelt9si00inu.x-ic-live-03,"Successful eradication and management of invasive plants require frequent and accurate maps. Detection of invasive plants is difficult at moderate resolution because target species are often located in the forest understory among other vegetation types, and so produce mixed spectral signatures. Spectral unmixing approaches can help to decompose these spectral mixtures; however, they are typically applied to only one or a few images, and thus neglect phenological variability that may improve invasive species discrimination. We compared two approaches to multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis for detecting Ligustrum sinense in the southeastern United States: the use of temporal signatures of endmembers from full and select-date normalized difference vegetation index time series, and conventional spectral unmixing using a single image date. Our results suggest that using temporal signatures from all available imagery may be a good choice, with minimal impact to achievable accuracy, if a priori information on phenological differences between endmembers is unavailable, or imagery for periods of high phenological difference are unavailable."

Our approach allows for the automatic integration of temporal knowledge, i.e., crop rotations using existing parcel-based land cover databases and multi-modal Sentinel-1 and -2 time series. The temporal evolution of crop types was modeled with a linear- chain conditional random field, trained with time series of multi-modal (radar and optical) satellite acquisitions and associated LPIS. Our model was tested on two study areas in France (≥1250 km2) which show different crop types, various parcel sizes, and agricultural practices: . the Seine et Marne and the Alpes de Haute-Provence classified accordingly to a fine national 25-class nomenclature. We first trained a Random Forest classifier without temporal structure to achieve 89.0% overall accuracy in Seine et Marne (10 classes) and 73% in Alpes de Haute-Provence (14 classes). We then demonstrated experimentally that taking into account the temporal structure of crop rotation with our model resulted in an increase of 3% to +5% in accuracy. This increase was especially important (+12%) for classes which were poorly classified without using the temporal structure. A stark posi- tive impact was also demonstrated on permanent crops, while it was fairly limited or even detrimental for annual crops."
Improved Depth Estimation for Occlusion Scenes Using a Light-Field Camera,"Yang, Changkun; Liu, Zhaoqin; Di, Kaichang; Hu, Changqing; Wang, Yexin; Liang, Wuyang",pp. 443-456(14),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2020/00000086/00000007/art00010;jsessionid=4pq5f0tfec8l5.x-ic-live-03,"With the development of light-field imaging technology, depth estimation using light-field cameras has become a hot topic in recent years. Even through many algorithms have achieved good performance for depth estimation using light-field cameras, removing the influence of occlusion, especially multi-occlusion, is still a challenging task. The photo-consistency assumption does not hold in the presence of occlusions, which makes most depth estimation of light-field imaging unreliable. In this article, a novel method to handle complex occlusion in depth estimation of light-field imaging is proposed. The method can effectively identify occluded pixels using a refocusing algorithm, accurately select unoccluded views using the adaptive unoccluded-view identification algorithm, and then improve the depth estimation by computing the cost volumes in the unoccluded views. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of our proposed algorithm compared with conventional state-of-the art algorithms on both synthetic and real light-field data sets."

In this paper, we describe the trajectory drift–compensated strategy that we designed to eliminate the influence of time drift between sensors, remove the inconsistency between the sequences from various sensors, and thereby generate a coarse-to-fine procedure for robust camera-tracking based on two-dimensional–3D observations from stereo sensors. We present the mathematical analysis of the iterative optimizations for pose tracking in a stereo red, green, blue plus depth (RGB-D) camera. Finally, complex indoor scenario experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed stereoRGB-Dsimultaneous localization and mapping solution.

In this study, the formation mechanisms of the aberration and atmospheric refraction errors in optical remote sensing satellite Earth observation imaging were analyzed quantitatively, and correction models were constructed. From this, the traditional geometric imaging model was refined by introducing a correction model for aberration and atmospheric refraction errors to create a more comprehensive geometric imaging model. The feasibility of an extended rational function model, based on the constructed more comprehensive geometric imaging model, was verified quantitatively."
Using 250-m MODIS Data for Enhancing Spatiotemporal Fusion by Sparse Representation,"Wang, Liguo; Wang, Xiaoyi; Wang, Qunming",pp. 383-392(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2020/00000086/00000006/art00015;jsessionid=3mama5697diea.x-ic-live-03,"Spatiotemporal fusion is an important technique to solve the problem of incompatibility between the temporal and spatial resolution of remote sensing data. In this article, we studied the fusion of Landsat data with fine spatial resolution but coarse temporal resolution and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data with coarse spatial resolution but fine temporal resolution. The goal of fusion is to produce time-series data with the fine spatial resolution of Landsat and the fine temporal resolution of MODIS. In recent years, learning-based spatiotemporal fusion methods, in particular the sparse representation-based spatiotemporal reflectance fusion model (SPSTFM), have gained increasing attention because of their great restoration ability for heterogeneous landscapes. However, remote sensing data from different sensors differ greatly on spatial resolution, which limits the performance of the spatiotemporal fusion methods (including SPSTFM) to some extent. In order to increase the accuracy of spatiotemporal fusion, in this article we used existing 250-m MODISbands (i.e., red and near-infrared bands) to downscale the observed 500-m MODIS bands to 250 m before SPTSFM-based fusion of MODIS and Landsat data. The experimental results show that the fusion accuracy of SPTSFM is increased when using 250-m MODIS data, and the accuracy of SPSTFM coupled with 250-m MODIS data is greater than the compared benchmark methods."
Geomorphic Change Detection Using Cost-Effective Structure-from-Motion Photogrammetry: Evaluation of Direct Georeferencing from Consumer-Grade UAS at Orewa Beach (New Zealand),"Bertin, Stephane; Levy, Benjamin; Gee, Trevor; Delmas, Patrice",pp. 289-298(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2020/00000086/00000005/art00009;jsessionid=19woxuweonvhy.x-ic-live-03,"Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and structure-from-motion photogrammetry are transforming the way we produce topo- graphic data, with applications covering many disciplines in the geosciences, including coastal studies. To overcome limitations of ground control points (GCPs), we evaluate direct georeferencing (DG) of consumer UAS imagery for the cost-effective measurement of beach topography. Using DG, camera positions determined with on-board instruments provide air control points for photogrammetry, obviating the need for presurveyed GCPs. We validate the approach at Orewa Beach, New Zealand, achieving vertical accuracies similar to light detection and ranging (< 0.2 m) at a higher resolution (< 0.1 m). A low-quality global navigation satellite system onboard a consumer UAS remains the main constraint on measurement quality. We show how independent topo- graphic data sets, which are increasingly available world- wide, can improve measurement quality, and hence change detection capacity. Our understanding of measurement quality achieved in this study is applied to the assessment of morphological and volumetric change at Orewa Beach."
An Improved Method of Refining Relative Orientation in Global Structure from Motion with a Focus on Repetitive Structure and Very Short Baselines,"Wang, X.; Heipke, C.",pp. 299-315(17),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2020/00000086/00000005/art00010;jsessionid=19woxuweonvhy.x-ic-live-03,"Recently, global structure from motion has successfully gained many followers, mainly because of its computational speed. Most of these global methods take the parameters of relative orientation (ROs ) as input and then perform averaging operations. Therefore, eliminating incorrect ROs is of great significance for improving the robustness of global structure from motion. In this article, we propose a method to eliminate wrong ROs which have resulted from repetitive structure and very short baselines. We present two corresponding criteria that indicate the quality of ROs. Repetitive structure is detected based on counts of conjugate points of the various image pairs, while very short baselines are found by inspecting the intersection angles of corresponding image rays. By analyzing these two criteria, we detect and eliminate incorrect ROs. As correct ROs of image pairs with a longer baseline nearly parallel to both viewing directions can be valuable, a method to identify and keep these ROs is also part of our approach. We demonstrate the new method on various data sets, including public benchmarks as well as close-range images and images from unmanned aerial vehicles, by inserting our refined ROs into a global structure-from-motion pipeline. The experiments show that compared to other methods, we can generate the best results."
Improving Component Substitution Pan-Sharpening Through Refinement of the Injection Detail,"Li, Xiaohua; Chen, Hao; Zhou, Jiliu; Wang, Yuan",pp. 317-325(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2020/00000086/00000005/art00011;jsessionid=19woxuweonvhy.x-ic-live-03,"This article presents a novel strategy for improving the well-established component substitution-based multispectral image fusion methods, because the fused results obtained by component substitution methods tend to exhibit significant spectral distortion. The main cause of spectral distortion is analyzed and discussed based on the component substitution method's general model. An improved scheme is derived from the sensitivity imaging model to refine the approximate spatial detail and obtain one that is almost ideal. The experimental results on two data sets show that when it has been integrated into the Gram–Schmidt method and the generalized intensity-hue-saturation method, the proposed scheme allows the production of fused images of the same spatial sharpness as standard implementations but with significantly increased spectral quality. Quantitative scores and visual inspection at full resolution and spatially reduced resolution confirm the superiority of the improved methods over the conventional algorithms."

Second, the correlation problem betweenRPCsand the influence of individualRPCson geometric positioning accuracy are analyzed and verified.

Temporal Validation of Four LAI Products over Grasslands in the Northeastern Tibetan Plateau,"Yin, Gaofei; Li, Ainong; Zhang, Zhengjian; Lei, Guangbin",pp. 225-233(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2020/00000086/00000004/art00010;jsessionid=1pc0ttmgs113d.x-ic-live-02,"Time series of leaf area index (LAI) products are now widely used, and the temporal validation is the prerequisite for their proper application. However, a systematical comparison between different products using both direct and indirect methods is still lacking. The objective of this paper is to assess and compare the temporal performances of fourLAIproducts: Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer(MODIS) LAI (MOD)15A2, MOD15A2h, Geoland2 Version 1(GEOV1), and Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS). The study area, which is dominated by grasslands, is located in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP), and temperature is the main stress factor affecting grass growth. Both a correlation analysis with temperature and a direct comparison with temporally continuousLAIreference maps were implemented in our temporal validation experiments. The results show that no single product can capture the rapid change and the seasonal trend inLAIsimultaneously, and the compositing period used in each product determines the quality of the correspondingLAItime series. TheMOD15A2andMOD15A2hproducts, which have short compositing windows (eight days), are suitable for detecting rapid change. A grazing-induced biomass decrease that occurred around day of year 205 in 2014 in our study area was clearly revealed in these two products. For the GEOV1andGLASSproducts, which have compositing windows of 30 days and 1 year, respectively, the grazing date was shifted (GEOV1) or even invisible (GLASS). However, products with prolonged compositing windows may be more robust to observation noise, and the resulting products may be suitable for capturing the seasonal trend. This study highlights that the concurrent use of data from various sensors onboard different satellites, and the introduction of new generations of satellites (e.g.,Gaofen-6), are two promising ways to further improve existingLAItime series."

First the image is rotated according to the direction of pixel displacement calculated by the rational function Model. Second, the Canny operator, combined with morphology and the Hough transform, is used to extract the building's elevation contour lines. Third, seed points and interesting points of the building are selected under the constraint of the contour line and the geodesic distance. Then foreground and background samples are obtained according to these points. Fourth, GrabCut and geometric features are used to carry out image segmentation and extract buildings. Finally, WorldView satellite images are used to verify the proposed method. Experimental results show that the average accuracy can reach 86.34%, which is 15.12% higher than other building extraction methods."
Topographic and Geomorphological Mapping and Analysis of the Chang'E-4 Landing Site on the Far Side of the Moon,"Wu, Bo; Li, Fei; Hu, Han; Zhao, Yang; Wang, Yiran; Xiao, Peipei; Li, Yuan; Liu, Wai Chung; Chen, Long; Ge, Xuming; Yang, Mei; Xu, Yingqiao; Ye, Qing; Wu, Xueying; Zhang, He",pp. 247-258(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2020/00000086/00000004/art00012;jsessionid=1pc0ttmgs113d.x-ic-live-02,"The Chinese lunar probe Chang'E-4 successfully landed in the Von Kármán crater on the far side of the Moon. This paper presents the topographic and geomorphological mapping and their joint analysis for selecting the Chang'E-4 landing site in the Von Kármán crater. A digital topographic model (DTM) of the Von Kármán crater, with a spatial resolution of 30 m, was generated through the integrated processing of Chang'E-2 images (7 m/pixel) and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Laser Altimeter (LOLA) data. Slope maps were derived from theDTM. Terrain occlusions to both the Sun and the relay satellite were studied. Craters with diameters ≥ 70 m were detected to generate a crater density map. Rocks with diameters ≥ 2 m were also extracted to generate a rock abundance map using anLROnarrow angle camera (NAC) image mosaic. The joint topographic and geomorphological analysis identified three subregions for landing. One of them, recommended as the highest-priority landing site, was the one in which Chang'E-4 eventually landed. After the successful landing of Chang'E-4, we immediately determined the precise location of the lander by the integrated processing of orbiter, descent and ground images. We also conducted a detailed analysis around the landing location. The results revealed that the Chang'E-4 lander has excellent visibility to the Sun and relay satellite; the lander is on a slope of about 4.5° towards the southwest, and the rock abundance around the landing location is almost 0. The developed methods and results can benefit future soft-landing missions to the Moon and other celestial bodies."

However, the high resolution results in highly complex data distributions, which lead to much noise for road detection—for example, shadows and occlusions caused by disturbance on the roadside make it difficult to accurately recognize road. In this article, a novel edge-reinforced convolutional neural network, combined with multiscale feature extraction and edge reinforcement, is proposed to alleviate this problem. First, multiscale feature extraction is used in the center part of the proposed network to extract multiscale context information. Then edge reinforcement, applying a simplified U-Net to learn additional edge information, is used to restore the road information. The two operations can be used with different convolutional neural networks. Finally, two public road data sets are adopted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with experimental results demonstrating its superiority."
The Application of Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function Data to Recognize the Spatial Heterogeneity of Mixed Pixels in Vegetation Remote Sensing: A Simulation Study,"Yan, Yanan; Deng, Lei; Liu, XianLin",pp. 161-167(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2020/00000086/00000003/art00007;jsessionid=muvqg9d5i3t2.x-ic-live-01,"Spectral decomposition of mixed pixels can provide information about the abundance of end members but fails to indicate the spatial distribution of end members in vegetation remote sensing. This work is a significant attempt to use the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) characteristics of mixed pixels in the prediction of spatial-heterogeneity metrics. Data sets from this function with different spatial distributions were constructed by the discrete anisotropic radiative transfer model, and three spatial aggregation and dispersion metrics were calculated: percentage of like adjacencies, spatial division index, and aggregation index. A simple linear regression method was used to construct the prediction model of spatial aggregation and dispersion metrics. The potential of multiangle remote sensing model for identifying spatial patterns well was demonstrated, and its importance was found to differ for different spatial aggregation and dispersion metrics. Specifically, the precision of the model based on multiangle reflectance used for predicting the spatial division index could meet a minimum root mean square of 5.95%. The reflectance features from backward observation on the principal plane play the leading role in recognizing the spatial heterogeneity of mixed pixels. The prediction model is sufficiently robust to distinguish the same vegetation with different growth trends, but also performs well when the ground objects have a smaller reflectance difference in the mixed pixels in a certain band. This study is expected to offer a new thought for spatial-heterogeneity identification of ground objects and thus promote the development of remote sensing technology in assessing spatial distribution."

It is composed of the Navigation Camera (NavCam) and the Mast Mechanism (MasMec). An improved self-calibration method for the stereo vision system of the Chang'e-4 lunar rover is proposed. The method consists of two parts: the NavCam's self-calibration and the MasMec's self-calibration. A combined adjustment based on the points and lines is proposed. The baseline constraint of the NavCam is considered. The self-calibration model of the MasMec is established based on the product-of-exponentials formula. Finally, the premission laboratory calibration and the on-site calibration are carried out. The laboratory calibration shows that the proposed approach has high accuracy. The checkpoint with a distance of about 2.7 m to the left NavCam has a point error of about 4 mm. Finally, the proposed approach is applied in the on-site calibration."
Reducing Shadow Effects on the Co-Registration of Aerial Image Pairs,"Plummer, Matthew; Stow, Douglas; Storey, Emanuel; Coulter, Lloyd; Zamora, Nicholas; Loerch, Andrew",pp. 177-186(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2020/00000086/00000003/art00009;jsessionid=muvqg9d5i3t2.x-ic-live-01,"Image registration is an important preprocessing step prior to detecting changes using multi-temporal image data, which is increasingly accomplished using automated methods. In high spatial resolution imagery, shadows represent a major source of illumination variation, which can reduce the performance of automated registration routines. This study evaluates the statistical relationship between shadow presence and image registration accuracy, and whether masking and normalizing shadows leads to improved automatic registration results. Eighty-eight bitemporal aerial image pairs were co-registered using software called Scale Invariant Features Transform (SIFT) and Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) Alignment (SARA). Co-registration accuracy was assessed at different levels of shadow coverage and shadow movement within the images. The primary outcomes of this study are (1) the amount of shadow in a multi-temporal image pair is correlated with the accuracy/success of automatic co-registration; (2) masking out shadows prior to match point select does not improve the success of image-to-image co-registration; and (3) normalizing or brightening shadows can help match point routines find more match points and therefore improve performance of automatic co-registration. Normalizing shadows via a standard linear correction provided the most reliable co-registration results in image pairs containing substantial amounts of relative shadow movement, but had minimal effect for pairs with stationary shadows."
Assessment of Salt Marsh Change on Assateague Island National Seashore Between 1962 and 2016,"Campbell, Anthony; Wang, Yeqiao",pp. 187-194(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2020/00000086/00000003/art00010;jsessionid=muvqg9d5i3t2.x-ic-live-01,"Salt marshes provide extensive ecosystem services, including high biodiversity, denitrification, and wave attenuation. In the mid-Atlantic, sea level rise is predicted to affect salt marsh ecosystems severely. This study mapped the entirety of Assateague Island with Very High Resolution satellite imagery and object-based methods to determine an accurate salt marsh baseline for change analysis. Topobathy-metric light detection and ranging was used to map the salt marsh and model expected tidal effects. The satellite imagery, collected in 2016 and classified at two hierarchical thematic schemes, were compared to determine appropriate thematic richness. Change analysis between this 2016 map and both a manually delineated 1962 salt marsh extent and image classification of the island from 1994 determined rates off change. The study found that from 1962 to 1994, salt marsh expanded by 4.01 ha/year, and from 1994 to 2016 salt marsh was lost at a rate of -3.4 ha/ year. The study found that salt marsh composition, (percent vegetated salt marsh) was significantly influenced by elevation, the length of mosquito ditches, and starting salt marsh composition. The study illustrates the importance of remote sensing monitoring for understanding site-specific changes to salt marsh environments and the barrier island system."
Using Ranked Probability Skill Score (RPSS) as Nonlocal Root-Mean-Square Errors (RMSEs) for Mitigating Wet Bias of Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Soil Moisture,"Lee, Ju Hyoung",pp. 91-98(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2020/00000086/00000002/art00008;jsessionid=27g96njoc08a7.x-ic-live-01,"To mitigate instantaneously evolving biases in satellite retrievals, a stochastic approach is applied over West Africa. This stochastic approach independently self-corrects Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) wet biases, unlike the cumulative density function (CDF) matching that rescales satellite retrievals with respect to several years of reference data. Ranked probability skill score (RPSS) is used as nonlocal root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) to assess stochastic retrievals. Stochastic method successfully decreasesRMSEsfrom 0.146 m3/m3to 0.056 m3/m3in the Republic of Benin and from 0.080 m3/m3to 0.038 m3/m3in Niger, while theCDFmatching method exacerbates the originalSMOSbiases up to 0.141 m3/m3in Niger, and 0.120 m3/m3in Benin. Unlike theCDFmatching or European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA))–interim soil moisture, only a stochastic retrieval responds to Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission rainfall. Based on the effects of bias correction, RPSS is suggested as a nonlocal verification without needing local measurements."

However, it lacks the ability to distinguish between the wealthy populations with a dense distribution and the less developed places. In this paper, the publicly available daytime Landsat images are used to estimate economic statistics. An end-to-end multi-task deep learning framework is constructed to estimate the county-level economy of Mainland China and the overall accuracy of this model achieves higher than 85%. The experiments show that our model provides a potential strategy to make up for the missing statistics and examines the reliability of the statistics collected for the central government."

Single and multiple linear regressions were tested for spatial resolutions ranging from 7 cm to 20 m using a small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) and satellite imagery from Planet,SPOT6, Pléiades, and Sentinel-2. Results suggest that imagery with spatial resolutions nearer the maize plant scale (i.e., 14–27 cm) are most effective for relating spectral signals with crop health on smallholder farms in Malawi. Consistent with other studies, green-band indices were more strongly correlated with maize chlorophyll content and yield than conventional red-band indices, and multivariable models often outperformed single variable models."

In theLRFmethod, two weighting methods are applied to obtain robustness to noise, point-density variation, and incomplete shape. Additionally, a vector representation is calculated to disambiguate the sign of the x-axis. The feature representation encodes the local information by generating the local coordinate images from five views. Thus, more geometric and spatial information is included in the descriptor.

The experimental results demonstrate well that theLRFis robust to noise, point-density variation, and incomplete shape, and theLSDholds strong robustness, superior descriptiveness, and high computational efficiency."
Application of PCA Analysis and QR Decomposition to Address RFM's Ill-Posedness,"Naeini, Amin Alizadeh; Moghaddam, Sayyed Hamed Alizadeh; Sheikholeslami, Mohammad Moein; Amiri-Simkooei, AliReza",pp. 17-21(5),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2020/00000086/00000001/art00008;jsessionid=761s8tp3hc8t7.x-ic-live-02,"Rational function model (RFM) is the most widely used sensor model in the remote sensing community. However, it suffers from ill-posedness, challenging its feasibility. This problem, i.e., ill-posedness, is mainly caused due to highly correlated coefficients of theRFM, which magnifies any small perturbations of observations, such as noise and instrumental error. This paper outlines a novel two-step method, called principal component analysis (PCA)-RFM, based on the integration ofPCAand QR decomposition. In the first step, thePCA-RFMreduces the observational perturbations from the design matrix using thePCA. In the next step, theRFM's coefficients are estimated using aQRdecomposition with column pivoting and least square method. According to the results, thePCA-RFMis less sensitive than its rivals to the changes of the ground control point (GCPs) distribution. Geometrically speaking, in addition,PCA-RFMis more accurate than recently established methods even in the presence of the small number ofGCPs."

Due to varying acquisition conditions (e.g., illumination, sensors, seasonal differences), the classification maps yielded are often inconsistent through time for robust statistical analysis. 3D geometric features have been shown to be stable for assessing differences across the temporal data set. Therefore, in this article we investigate the use of a multi-temporal orthophoto and digital surface model derived from satellite data for spatiotemporal classification. Our approach consists of two major steps: generating per-class probability distribution maps using the random-forest classifier with limited training samples, and making spatiotemporal inferences using an iterative 3D spatiotemporal filter operating on per-class probability maps. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can consistently improve the individual classification results by 2%–6% and thus can be an important postclassification refinement approach."

They differ geometrically from central-perspective cameras because of light reflection from the mirror surface. To handle these effects, we present new pose-estimation and reconstruction models for imaging through spherical mirrors. We derive a closed-form equivalent to the collinearity principle via which three methods are established to estimate the system parameters: a resection-based one, a trilateration-based one that introduces novel constraints that enhance accuracy, and a direct and linear transform-based one. The estimated system parameters exhibit improved accuracy compared to the state of the art, and analysis shows intrinsic robustness to the presence of a high fraction of outliers. We then show that 3D point reconstruction can be performed at accurate levels. Thus, we provide an in-depth look into the geometrical modeling of spherical catadioptric systems and practical enhancements of accuracies and requirements to reach them."
A Learning Approach to Evaluate the Quality of 3D City Models,"Ennafii, Oussama; Le Bris, Arnaud; Lafarge, Florent; Mallet, Clément",pp. 865-878(14),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2019/00000085/00000012/art00010;jsessionid=7gipfrda5pefm.x-ic-live-02,"The automatic generation of three-dimensional (3D) building models from geospatial data is now a standard procedure. An abundance of literature covers the last two decades, and several solutions are now available. However, urban areas are very complex environments. Inevitably, practitioners still have to visually assess, at a city-scale, the correctness of these models and detect frequent reconstruction errors. Such a process relies on experts and is highly time-consuming, with approximately two hours/km 2 per expert. This work proposes an approach for automatically evaluating the quality of 3D building models. Potential errors are compiled in a novel hierarchical and versatile taxonomy. This allows, for the first time, to disentangle fidelity and modeling errors, whatever the level of details of the modeled buildings. The quality of models is predicted using the geometric properties of buildings and, when available, Very High Resolution images and Digital Surface Models. A baseline of handcrafted, yet generic, features is fed into a Random Forest classifier. Both multiclass and multilabel cases are considered: due to the interdependence between classes of errors, it is possible to retrieve all errors at the same time while simply predicting correct and erroneous buildings. The proposed framework was tested on three distinct urban areas in France with more than 3000 buildings. 80%–99% F-score values are attained for the most frequent errors. For scalability purposes, the impact of the urban area composition on the error prediction was also studied, in terms of transferability, generalization, and representativeness of the classifiers. It showed the necessity of multimodal remote sensing data and mixing training samples from various cities to ensure a stability of the detection ratios, even with very limited training set sizes."

Due to the complexity of the ground object distribution, some end-member extraction methods cannot obtain good results and the processes are complex. Therefore, this paper proposes an optimization method forHSIendmember extraction, which improves the accuracy of the results based on K-singular value decomposition (K-SVD). The proposed method comprises three core steps. (1) Based on the contribution value of initial endmembers, partially observed data selected according to the appropriate confidence participate in the calculation. (2) Construction of the error model to eliminate the background noise. (3) Using theK-SVDto perform column-by-column iteration on the endmembers to achieve the overall optimality. Experiments with three real images are applied, demonstrating the proposed method can improve the overall endmember accuracy by 15.1%–55.7% compared with the original methods."

Image triangulation was conducted in accordance with interior orientation parameters, determined by camera self-calibration. Precise orthomosaic images and digital surface models were generated, and their accuracy was assessed using aerial and terrestrial lidar data. Digital surface models were used to estimate earthwork volumes and verify the suitability ofUAVphotogrammetry for use on construction sites. Georeferencing accuracy shows that the smart camera performs about twice as well as the smartphone with reference to checkpoints and polygon parts. Considering rolling shutter in the smartphone, it is possible to increase accuracy. Especially in inclined and rugged topography, the smartphone can benefit from applying the rolling-shutter method. Earthwork of volume error is often applied as a legal requirement for some countries, and our findings indicate that a smart camera with a drone can be effectively and economically used in earthworks."
Cost-Effective Coastal Habitat Mapping: Detecting Intertidal Polychaete Aggregations with Low-Altitude Photogrammetry,"Alves, Renata M.

Remote reef mapping remains challenging due to severe and dynamic conditions, as well as cover and spatial resolution requirements. This study (1) evaluated kite aerial photography and low-altitude digital photogrammetry to map and monitor intertidal aggregations of a sessile tube-building polychaete, Lanice conchilega (L. conchilega), and (2) developed a protocol for its remote identification. Monthly campaigns yielded 12 aerial image sets which were processed using structure-from-motion into high-precision digital terrain models and orthophoto mosaics. Maximum likelihood classification distinguished L. conchilega from bare sediment with an accuracy of 70% ± 23.2%. Aggregations were delineated by extracting elements of positive elevation from local difference models. The method has proven useful to detect high-value aggregations, distinguishing these consistently. Nevertheless, systematic biases were present during delineation, and further characterisation of reference aggregations may improve detection."
A Two-Stage Spatiotemporal Fusion Method for Remote Sensing Images,"Sun, Yue; Zhang, Hua",pp. 907-914(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2019/00000085/00000012/art00014;jsessionid=7gipfrda5pefm.x-ic-live-02,"This paper presents a two-stage spatiotemporal fusion method for obtaining dense remote sensing images with both high spatial and temporal resolution. Considering the large resolution differences between fine- and coarse-resolution images, the proposed method is implemented in two stages. In the first stage, the input fine- and coarse-resolution images are preprocessed to the same intermediate resolution images, respectively. Then, a linear interpolation model is introduced to fuse these resampled images for predicting preliminary fusion results. In the second stage, a residual dense network is used to learn the nonlinear mapping between the preliminary fusion results and the real fine-resolution data to reconstruct the final fine-resolution data. Two data sets with different land surface types are employed to test the performance of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed method is advantageous in such areas with phenological changes, and even for the data sets with land cover changes being the main type, it still has a good ability to predict spatial structure information of images."

This method combines optical and radar data at the field scale and uses MPSO to optimize the weight of the neural network. An effective inertia weight is introduced in the MPSO and an implicit relationship between backscatter coefficient and soil moisture is established. Experimental results show that the combining method produces better accuracy than other inversion methods with R2of 72.2% and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.033 cm3/cm3, respectively. Meanwhile, the estimated accuracy of surface soil moisture using radar and optical data simultaneously is much higher than that using only a single data source as input with R2of 0.827 and RMSE of 0.029 cm3/cm3. Therefore, the combining method can effectively improve the accuracy of soil moisture retrieval and provide support for large-scale agricultural monitoring."
Scattering-Mechanism-Based Investigation of Optimal Combinations of Polarimetric SAR Frequency Bands for Land Cover Classification,"Qi, Zhixin; Yeh, Anthony Gar-On; Li, Xia",pp. 799-813(15),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2019/00000085/00000011/art00009;jsessionid=bemtlp2nt52s0.x-ic-live-03,"Aiming at steering the selection of optimal combinations of polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) frequency bands for different land cover classification schemes, this study investigates the land cover classification capabilities of all the possible combinations of L-band ALOS PALSAR fully PolSAR data, C-band RADARSAT-2 fully PolSAR data, and X-band TerraSAR-X HH SAR data. A method that integrates polarimetric decomposition, object-based image analysis, decision tree algorithms, and support vector machines is used for the classification. Polarimetric decomposition theorems are used to interpret the scattering mechanisms at the different frequency bands to reveal the effect mechanisms of PolSAR frequency variation on the classification capability. This study finds that (1) X-band HH SAR is not necessary for classifying the land cover types involved in this study when C- or L-band fully PolSAR are used; (2) C-band fully PolSAR alone is adequate for classifying primitive land cover types, namely, water, bare land, vegetation, and built-up areas; and (3) L-band fully PolSAR alone is adequate for distinguishing between various vegetation types, such as crops, banana trees, and forests."

The cameras work together to obtain an image 800 km wide, with a resolution of 16 m, allowing GF1 to complete a global scan in four days. To achieve high-accuracy calibration of the wide-field-of-view cameras on GF1, the calibration field should have high resolution and broad coverage based on the traditional calibration method. In this study, a GF self-calibration scheme was developed. It uses partial reference calibration data covering the selected primary charge-coupled device to achieve high-accuracy calibration of the whole image. Based on the absolute constraint of the ground control points and the relative constraint of the tie points of stereoscopic images, we present two geometric calibration models based on paired stereoscopic images and three stereoscopic images for wide-field-of-view cameras on GF1, along with corresponding stepwise internal-parameter estimation methods. Our experimental results indicate that the internal relative accuracy can be guaranteed after calibration. This article provides a new approach that enables large-field-of-view optical satellites to achieve high-accuracy calibration based on partial calibration-field coverage."

Road lamp and lane are the common sobjects on roads; the spatial distributions are regular, and thus our registration method has wide applicability and high precision. First, the road lamp and lane were extracted from the LiDAR points by horizontal grid and reflectance intensity and then by optimizing the endpoints as the feature points of road lamp and lane. Second, the feature points were projected onto the panoramic image by initial parameters and then by extracting corresponding feature points near the projection location. Third, the direct linear transformation method was used to solve the registration model and eliminate mismatching feature points. In the experiments, we compare the accuracy of our registration method with other registration methods by a sequence of panoramic images. The results show that our registration method is effective; the registration accuracy of our method is less than 10 pixels and averaged 5.84 pixels in all 31 panoramic images (4000 × 8000 pixels), which is much less than that of the 56.24 pixels obtained by the original registration method."

Active Learning (AL) and Semisupervised Learning (SSL) are two promising techniques to achieve this challenge. Combining AL with SSL is an excellent idea for hyperspectral image classification. The traditional method, such as the Collaborative Active and Semisupervised Learning algorithm (CASSL), may introduce many incorrect pseudolabels and shows premature convergence. To overcome these drawbacks, a novel framework named Double-Strategy-Check Collaborative Active and Semisupervised Learning (DSC-CASSL) is proposed in this paper. This framework combines two different AL algorithms and SSL in a collaborative mode. The double-strategy verification can gradually improve the pseudolabeling accuracy and facilitate SSL. We evaluate the performance of DSC-CASSL on four hyperspectral data sets and compare it with that of four hyperspectral image classification methods. Our results suggest that DSC-CASSL leads to consistent improvement for hyperspectral image classification."

This study examined Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series for characterizing annual urban change. To reduce impacts from cloud contamination and missing data, United States Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat Analysis Ready Data were processed to derive annual NDVI layers using a maximum value composite algorithm. National Land Cover Database land cover products from 2001 and 2011 were used as references for generating a decadal urban change mask. Within the decadal urban change mask and using annual NDVI as input, we examined three time-series change detection methods to pinpoint specific year of urban change: (a) minimum-value method, (b) break-point detection, and (c) simple-threshold identification. For accuracy assessment, we divided change pixels into urbanization and urban-intensification pixel groups, defined by initial land cover types. We used Google Earth's High-Resolution Imagery Archive as primary reference data for detailed accuracy assessment. Overall, the urbanization pixel group has good change detection accuracies of above 82% for all three change detection algorithms. The break-point detection method resulted in the highest overall accuracy of 88%. Overall accuracies for urban intensification pixel group were in the range of 35%–76%, depending on choice of change detection algorithm, length of input time-series, and further division of pixel subgroups."

Grayscale differences and geometric distortions often occur among multisource images due to their different imaging mechanisms, thus making it difficult to acquire feature points and match corresponding points. This article proposes a scene shape similarity feature (SSSF) descriptor based on scene shape features and shape context algorithms. A new similarity measure called SSSFnccis then defined by computing the normalized correlation coefficient of the SSSF descriptors between multisource remote sensing images. Furthermore, the tie points between the reference and the sensed image are extracted via a template matching strategy. A global consistency check method is then used to remove the mismatched tie points. Finally, a piecewise linear transform model is selected to rectify the remote sensing image. The proposed SSSFnccaims to extract the scene shape similarity between multisource images. The accuracy of the proposed SSSFnccis evaluated using five pairs of experimental images from optical, synthetic aperture radar, and map data. Registration results demonstrate that the SSSFnccsimilarity measure is robust enough for complex nonlinear grayscale differences among multisource remote sensing images. The proposed method achieves more reliable registration outcomes compared with other popular methods."

First, divide the remote sensing image into blocks and extract their deep features by a lightweight multi-branch convolutional neural network (LMB-CNN). Second, rearrange the deep features into feature maps that are fed into a well-designed FCN for image segmentation. Our FCN is integrated with multi-branch blocks and outputs multi-channel segmentation masks that are utilized to balance the false alarm and missing alarm. Experiments demonstrate that the overall classification accuracy of the proposed algorithm can achieve 98.75% in the test data set and that it has a faster processing compared with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms."

This process can be more challenging with low-cost airborne laser scanning (ALS) systems because some device connections from off-the-shelf sensors are less stable. An alternative to synchronization is performing a postprocessing clock correction. This article presents a technique for postprocessing synchronization (off-line) that estimates clock differences based on the correlation between the signals from the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) trajectory and the light detection and ranging (lidar) range, followed by refinement with a least-squares method. The correlation between signals was automatically estimated considering the planned flight maneuvers, in a flat terrain, to produce altimetric trajectory variations. Experiments were performed with an Ibeo LUX laser unit integrated with a NovAtel SPAN-IGM-S1 inertial navigation system that was transported by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The planimetric and altimetric accuracies of the point cloud obtained with the proposed postprocessing synchronization technique were 28 cm and 10 cm, respectively, at a flight height of 35 m."

Although several DSM super resolution (SR) methods have been developed to ease the problem, a new issue that plenty of DSM samples are needed to train the model is raised. Therefore, considering the original images have vital influence on its DSM's accuracy, we address the problem by directly improving images resolution. Several SR models are refined and brought into the traditional DSM generation process as an image quality improvement stage to construct an easy but effective workflow for subpixel level DSM generation. Experiments verified the validity and significance of bringing SR technology into this kind of application. Statistical analysis also confirmed that a subpixel level DSM with higher fidelity can be obtained more easily compared to directly DSM interpolation."

However, the effective range of such sensors is limited due to the working range of the infra-red (IR) camera, which provides depth information, and thus the practicability of such sensors in 3D mapping and modeling is limited. To address this limitation, we present a novel solution for enhanced 3D mapping using a low-cost RGB-D sensor. We carry out state-of-the-art visual SLAM to obtain 3D point clouds within the mapping range of the RGB-D sensor and implement an improved structure-from-motion (SfM) on the collected RGB image sequences with additional constraints from the depth information to produce image-based 3D point clouds. We then develop a feature-based scale-adaptive registration to merge the gained point clouds to further generate enhanced and extended 3D mapping results. We use two challenging test sites to examine the proposed method. At these two sites, the coverage of both generated 3D models increases by more than 50% with the proposed solution. Moreover, the proposed solution achieves a geometric accuracy of about 1% in a measurement range of about 20 m. These positive experimental results not only demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed solution but also its potential."

These values also meet the 1:1000 scale mapping requirements in China. However, the original direct geopositioning accuracy of the GFXJ is approximately 4 m in the planimetry direction and 6 m in the elevation direction. To meet the ground 3D point accuracy requirements and improve the direct geopositioning accuracy of the GFXJ, this paper carries out a deep investigation on the GFXJ geometric calibration. This geometric calibration includes two main parts: the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) lever arms and inertial measurement unit (IMU) boresight misalignment calibration, and the camera lens and CCD line distortion calibration. First, a brief introduction is given on the imaging properties of the GFXJ camera. Then, the GNSS lever arms and IMU boresight misalignment calibration models are built for the GFXJ camera. Next, a piecewise self-calibration model based on the CCD viewing angle is established for the GFXJ lens and CCD line distortion calibration. Subsequently, an iterative two-step calibration scheme is proposed for the geometric calibration. Finally, experiments were implemented using multiple flight blocks obtained in the Songshan remote sensing comprehensive field and the Hegang area of Heilongjiang Province. Through calibration experiments, geometric calibration values were obtained for the GNSS lever arms and IMU boresight misalignment. Reliable CAM files were independently generated for the forward, nadir, and backward line arrays. The experiments showed that the proposed GNSS lever arms and IMU boresight misalignment calibration models and the piecewise self-calibration model had good applicability and effectiveness for the GFXJ camera. The proposed two-step calibration scheme can significantly enhance the geometric positioning accuracy of the GFXJ camera. The original direct geopositioning accuracy of the GFXJ is approximately 4 m in the planimetry direction and 6 m in the elevation direction. Using the GNSS lever arms and the IMU boresight misalignment calibration values and the CAM files, the positioning accuracy of the GFXJ camera can fulfill the 3D point accuracy requirements and the 1:1000 mapping accuracy requirements at a 2000 m flight height after aerial triangulation with only several ground control points. The planimetry accuracy is approximately 0.2 m, and the elevation accuracy is less than 0.28 m. In addition, the calibration models and calibration scheme established in this paper can provide a reference for calibration studies on other airborne linear array CCD cameras."

Sparse-representation models have been increasingly explored for HSI classification because of their compactness, flexibility, and discriminative power. In this article, a novel HSI scheme is proposed based on collaborative sparse coding combined with smoothness regularization (CSCSR). First, based on the spatial piecewise continuity of HSIs, spectral-spatial preprocessing is performed to improve classification accuracy. Second, a collaborative sparse-coding model with smoothness regularization is proposed and applied for HSI classification. In our model, the sparsity level and smoothness regularization are tuned to improve classification performance. In addition, weighted pixel similarities are computed in pixel neighborhoods and then used to incorporate spatial information in the HSI classification scheme. A feature-sign search algorithm is used for sparse coding of feature descriptors. Experimental results on real HSI data sets demonstrate that the proposed CSCSR method effectively outperforms the current state-of-the-art HSI classifiers in terms of both qualitative and quantitative metrics."

This article proposes a pyramid convolutional neural triplet network that extracts a 128-dimensional deep descriptor that significantly improves the matching performance. The proposed approach first extracts deep descriptors of the anchor patches and corresponding positive patches in a batch using the proposed pyramid convolutional neural network. Following this step, the approaches chooses the closest negative patch for each anchor patch and corresponding positive patch pair to form the triplet sample based on the descriptor distances among all other image patches in the batch. These triplets are used to optimize the parameters of the network using a new loss function. We evaluated the proposed deep descriptors on two benchmark data sets (Brown and HPatches) as well as real image data sets. The results reveal that the proposed descriptor achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the Brown data set and a comparatively very high performance on the HPatches data set. The proposed approach finds more correct matches than the classical handcrafted feature descriptors on aerial image pairs and is observed to be robust to variations in the viewpoint and illumination."

Here, a robust phenology-based algorithm—namely the change rate of the Landsat-derived normalized burn ratio—was modified based on tri-windows (i.e., predefoliation, defoliation, and foliation) and then used to discriminate deciduous rubber plantations from other land cover types by applying a threshold of 1.0 and combining Landsat-based forest masks every five years during 1991–2016. Deciduous rubber plantations increased more than 6.6 times, approximately 3074 km2in 2016, or at an annual rate of about 8% (104 km2/year) in Xishuangbanna over that period, showing two typical expansion trends toward both higher (over 1000 m) and lower (below 600 m) elevations and increasingly spread to borderlands with Laos and Myanmar."

In this work, a novel roof-cut approach is developed using graph-based model to locate rooftops and demolished buildings through the use of imagery and preexisting building footprint maps. The building region, boundary, and rooftop contour constraint terms were first formulated by multiple cues derived from both data sources. Next, roof-cut segmentation was performed by gathering all terms required for high-quality unsupervised rooftop extraction. Finally, the positional displacement statistics of similar adjacent buildings were collected to accurately estimate the rooftop location and achieve building demolition detection with the overlap ratio index. Experimental results indicated the effectiveness and generality of the proposed roof-cut algorithm for aerial and satellite images."

First, a fast and robust strategy for extraction of feature points from large-scale scanning scenes is proposed and used to represent the scanning scene. Correspondences are then established using a contextual rule-based method at the two-dimensional and three-dimensional levels. A penalization strategy is then introduced to generate dense corresponding sets between two overlapping point clouds. Finally, a three-stage optimal strategy is implemented to efficiently match these point clouds. The proposed approach highlights the following aspects: (1) The designed voting-based feature extraction method can efficiently and robustly represent a scanning scene in a complex environment with a huge database; (2) The contextual information enables the generation of more reliable correspondences beyond the geometric features; (3) The novel penalization strategy and the three-stage optimal method benefit the approach to achieve tight alignment at a lower computational cost.

Pavement Marking Retroreflectivity Estimation and Evaluation using Mobile Lidar Data,"Che, Erzhuo; Olsen, Michael J.; Parrish, Christopher E.; Jung, Jaehoon",pp. 573-583(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2019/00000085/00000008/art00010;jsessionid=1xlghvdq8krv5.x-ic-live-02,"Pavement markings are produced with retroreflective materials to enhance visibility for motorists, particularly at night. Retroreflectivity evaluation throughout an extensive highway network for maintenance and asset management purposes is a critical, yet challenging task for transportation agencies because visual evaluation can often be subjective and inconsistent, while field measurement can be time-consuming. Mobile Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) datasets can potentially provide a safe, cost-effective, and reliable method of performing the required evaluation. This paper presents an empirical model for radiometric calibration of Lidar intensity information from the Leica Pegasus:Two system for pavement marking evaluation. The model was developed using dense handheld retroreflectometer measurements and mobile Lidar data collected in a variety of geometric configurations on a test site consisting of various markings with varying degrees of wear. The quantitative accuracy assessment of the proposed radiometric calibration model for estimating retroreflectivity was conducted to another independent dataset collected in different lanes and system configurations."

TheTVUmodel consists of a combination of analytical uncertainty propagation for the subaerial (above water) portion and Monte Carlo simulation models for the subaqueous portion (water surface to seafloor). TheTVUmodel was tested on a topo-bathymetricLIDARdata set collected by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Geodetic Survey (NGS) in Southwest Florida, U.S., in May 2016 using a Riegl VQ-880-G topo-bathymetric LIDARsystem. TheTVUvalues were compared against the empirical standard deviation and were found to capture the variability of uncertainty with depth while providing (slightly) conservative estimates of uncertainty. The results may be used to inform data acquisition protocols and data processing models. The model implementation is now beginning to be used operationally atNGSfor topo-bathymetricLIDARprojects."

Remote sensing-based land cover maps must be continuously updated to satisfy the requirements of their users. An incremental updating method for land cover maps based on image cosegmentation and a geo-eco zoning-rule database is presented. First, cosegmentation of multitemporal satellite images is used to extract incremental (land cover change) pixels. Then the reliability of the change-detection results is improved by using the geo-eco zoning-rule database to detect and remove spurious changes. Finally, old land cover maps are updated to create new land cover maps. A test data set of 1200×1200 pixels from GlobeLand30 2000 land cover maps are updated to GlobeLand30 2010 land cover maps with an overall accuracy of 84.6%."

The aim here is to evaluate various approaches to correct tree occlusions and instrument bias estimates calculated with data from ForeStereo (proximal sensor based on stereoscopic hemispherical images) under a fixed-point sampling strategy. Distance-sampling and the new hemispherical photogrammetric correction (HPC), which combines image segmentation-based correction for instrument bias with a novel approach for estimating the proportion of shadowed sampling area in stereoscopic hemispherical images, best estimated N and basal area (BA). Distance-sampling slightly overestimated N (11% bias, 0.60 Pearson coefficient with the reference measures) and BA (4%, 0.82). HPC provided less biased N estimates (-6%, 0.61) but underestimated BA (-8%, 0.83). HPC most accurately retrieved the diameter distribution."

In this study, we developed a frequency decomposition method to separate woody and herbaceous vegetation components using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series. The results were validated using fractional cover data derived from high-resolution images. The validation revealed a close relationship between our decomposed NDVI and corresponding fractional cover (R2= 0.55 and 0.64 for woody and herbaceous components, respectively). We examined the spatial and temporal patterns of the decomposed NDVI, where woody and herbaceous NDVI showed different responses to precipitation. The methods proposed in this study can be used to separate the woody and herbaceous NDVI time series as an alternative approach for monitoring woody and herbaceous vegetation interrelationships related to climatic drivers."
Examining the Effectiveness of Spectrally Transformed SMA in Urban Environments,"Deng, Yingbin; Wu, Changshan",pp. 521-528(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2019/00000085/00000007/art00014;jsessionid=8n50qs83pgqod.x-ic-live-02,"Spectral transformation has been applied to address the spectral variability in spectral mixture analysis. However, there is not a study addressing the necessity and applicability of transformed models. This article, therefore, aims to answer two questions: whether significantly different results will be generated through applying a spectral transformation, and which spectral transformation performs better in urban environments. In particular, 26 spectrally transformed schemes were examined in three cities. Results of paired-sample t tests demonstrated that normalized spectral mixture analysis performed significantly better than the untransformed scheme in all three study areas. Derivative analysis, independent component analysis, and minimum noise fraction outperformed the untransformed scheme in one or two study areas but underperformed in others. Other schemes are unnecessary, as they have significantly lower accuracy compared to the untransformed scheme."
CNN-Based Dense Image Matching for Aerial Remote Sensing Images,"Ji, Shunping; Liu, Jin; Lu, Meng",pp. 415-424(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2019/00000085/00000006/art00009;jsessionid=2hfjhc01ja924.x-ic-live-02,"Dense stereo matching plays a key role in 3D reconstruction. The capability of using deep learning in the stereo matching of remote sensing data is currently uncertain. This article investigated the application of deep learning–based stereo methods in aerial image series and proposed a deep learning–based multi-view dense matching framework. First, we applied three typical convolutional neural network models, MC-CNN, GC-Net, and DispNet, to aerial stereo pairs and compared the results with those of the SGM and a commercial software, SURE. Second, on different data sets, the generalization ability of each network is evaluated by using direct transfer learning with models pretrained on other data sets and by fine-tuning with a small number of target training data. Third, we present a deep learning–based multi-view dense matching framework where the multi-view geometry is introduced to further refine matching results. Three sets of aerial images as the main data sets and two open-source sets of street images as auxiliary data sets are used for testing. Experiments show that, first, the performance of deep learning–based stereo methods is slightly better than traditional methods. Second, both the GC-Net and the MC-CNN have demonstrated good generalization ability and can obtain satisfactory results on aerial images using a pretrained model on several available stereo benchmarks. Third, multi-view geometry constraints can further improve the performance of deep learning–based methods, which is better than that of the multi-view–based SGM and SURE."

Traditional classification method (i.e., random forests) is compared with state-of-the-art fully convolutional networks (FCNs). Random forests use hand-craft image features including red, green, blue (RGB), scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), and Texton, and point cloud features consisting of normal vector and planarity extracted from different scales. In contrast, the inputs of FCNs are the RGB bands and the third components of normal vectors. In both cases, three-dimensional (3D) features are projected back into the image space to support the facade interpretation. Fully connected conditional random field (CRF) is finally taken as a post-processing of the FCN to refine the segmentation results. Several tests have been performed and the achieved results show that the models embedding the 3D component outperform the solution using only images. FCNs significantly outperformed random forests, especially for the balcony delineation."

To address this issue, we present RoofN3D which provides a three-dimensional (3D) point cloud training dataset that can be used to train machine learning models for different tasks in the context of 3D building reconstruction. The details about RoofN3D and the developed framework to automatically derive such training data are described in this paper. Furthermore, we provide an overview of other available 3D point cloud training data and approaches from current literature in which solutions for the application of deep learning to 3D point cloud data are presented.

While the primary field of application is wide-area mapping of topography and urban scenes, charting bathymetry of clear and shallow water areas is equally feasible via application of multimedia photogrammetry. The article specifically investigates the potential of through-water DIM for high resolution mapping of generally low textured shallow water areas using modern techniques like semiglobal matching and off-the-shelf software. In a case study, the DIM-derived underwater surfaces of coastal and inland water bodies are compared to concurrently acquired laser bathymetry data. With an achieved penetration depth of more than 5 m and deviations in the dm-range compared to the laser data as reference, the results confirm the general feasibility of through-water DIM. However, sufficient bottom texture and favorable environmental conditions are a precondition for achieving accurate results."
Object-Based Point Cloud Analysis for Landslide and Erosion Monitoring,"Mayr, Andreas; Rutzinger, Martin; Geitner, Clemens",pp. 455-462(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2019/00000085/00000006/art00013;jsessionid=2hfjhc01ja924.x-ic-live-02,"Today point clouds from close-range sensing are used for operational erosion and landslide monitoring. Distances between points from multi-temporal acquisitions can indicate surface deformation, while a designation of the underlying geomorphological processes is often handicapped by complex terrain structures and vegetation. We present an approach to landslide monitoring that integrates semantic information and three-dimensional deformation detection automatically. Surface changes are assigned to (i) semantic object classes (landslide scarp, eroded area, deposit) and (ii) to spatially contiguous, individual objects (like parts of the landslide scarp and moving clods of turf and soil). We demonstrate this object-based approach with a time series of 13 topographic Light Detection and Ranging point clouds, covering a site affected by shallow landsliding. The results of this case study illustrate how the presented methods translate the unstructured point clouds into information on geomorphological process dynamics to support erosion and landslide assessment."
Robust Structure From Motion Based on Relative Rotations and Tie Points,"Wang, X.; Rottensteiner, F.; Heipke, C.",pp. 347-359(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2019/00000085/00000005/art00012;jsessionid=157qoba9z2mwa.x-ic-live-01,"In this article, we present two new approaches for image orientation with a focus on robustness, starting with relative orientations of available image pairs, an incremental and a global one, and compare their performance. For the incremental approach, we first choose a suitable initial image pair, and we then iteratively extend the image cluster by adding new images. The rotations of these newly added images are estimated from relative rotations by single rotation averaging. In the next step, a linear equation system is set up for each new image to solve the translation parameters with triangulated tie points that can be viewed in that new image, followed by a resection for refinement. Finally, we refine the orientation parameters of the images by a local bundle adjustment. We also present a global method that consists of two parts: global rotation averaging, followed by setting up a large linear equation system to solve for all image translation parameters simultaneously; a final bundle adjustment is carried out to refine the results. We compare these two methods by analyzing results on different benchmark sets, including ordered and unordered image data sets from the Internet and two other challenging data sets to demonstrate the performance of our two approaches. We conclude that while the incremental method typically yields results of higher accuracy and performs better on the challenging data sets, our global method runs significantly faster."
Flexible Photogrammetric Computations Using Modular Bundle Adjustment: The Chain Rule and the Collinearity Equations,"Börlin, Niclas; Murtiyoso, Arnadi; Grussenmeyer, Pierre; Menna, Fabio; Nocerino, Erica",pp. 361-368(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2019/00000085/00000005/art00013;jsessionid=157qoba9z2mwa.x-ic-live-01,"The main purpose of this article is to show that photogram-metric bundle-adjustment computations can be sequentially organized into modules. Furthermore, the chain rule can be used to simplify the computation of the analytical Jacobians needed for the adjustment. Novel projection models can be flexibly evaluated by inserting, modifying, or swapping the order of selected modules. As a proof of concept, two variants of the pinhole projection model with Brown lens distortion were implemented in the open-source Damped Bundle Adjustment Toolbox and applied to simulated and calibration data for a nonconventional lens system. The results show a significant difference for the simulated, error-free, data but not for the real calibration data. The current flexible implementation incurs a performance loss. However, in cases where flexibility is more important, the modular formulation should be a useful tool to investigate novel sensors, data-processing techniques, and refractive models."

Since the photogram-metric procedure applied to images produces a projective model, some external information is needed in order to obtain a 3D metric model. To this aim, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements are typically aided to the photogrammetric reconstruction procedure. How- ever, the quality of the obtained reconstruction is related to the GNSS positioning accuracy, which is typically at meterlevel for cheap receivers as those embedded in most of the consumer mobile devices, e.g.smartphones. Furthermore, this approach cannot be used in GNSS-denied environments (e.g.indoors). To overcome these issues, this paper investigates the integration of information provided by an Ultra-Wideband (UWB) positioning system with image-based reconstruction to produce a metric reconstruction. Further-more, the orientation (with respect to North-East directions) of the model is assessed thanks to the use of inertial sensors included in the UWB devices. Results of this integration are shown on two case studies in indoor environments."

Input images are selected based on view angles and capture dates. We apply the relative bias-compensated model for orientation, and then generate the epipolar image pairs. The images are matched by the modified tube-based SemiGlobal Matching method (tSGM). Within the triangulation step, very dense point clouds are produced, and are fused by a median filter to generate the Digital Surface Model (DSM). A comparison with the reference data shows that the fused DSM generated by our pipeline is accurate and robust."

However, due to a lack of suitable training data, this technique is not readily applicable for plant reconstruction. We propose a self-supervised Matching Cost with a Convolutional Neural Network (MC-CNN) scheme to calculate matching cost and test it for plant reconstruction. The MC-CNN network is retrained using the initial matching results obtained from the standard MC-CNN weights. For the experiment, closerange photogrammetric imagery of an in-house plant is used. The results show that the performance of self-supervised MC-CNN is superior to the Census algorithm and comparable to MC-CNN trained by a Light Detection and Ranging point cloud. Another experiment is performed using stereo imagery of a field beech tree. The proposed self-training strategy is tested and has proved capable of identifying the drought condition of trees from the reconstructed leaves."

First, the adaptive image cloud detection spectral threshold is obtained according to the image equalization histogram. Second, the initial cloud detection result is obtained based on spectral threshold of the cloud detection and spectral attributes of superpixels. Third, the initial cloud detection result is refined based on the gray value and angular second moment of the superpixels local binary patterns texture to eliminate the influence of cloud-like ground objects. Finally, the cloud detection result is processed using the region growing algorithm and expansion algorithm to obtain an accurate cloud detection result.

Bathymetry algorithms relying on multispectral imagery are conventionally limited by the availability ofin situreference depths, particularly in remote or difficult-to-map areas. Therefore, a completely spaceborne approach could greatly extend the usefulness of such algorithms. The approach is tested with data from NASA's airborne ICESat-2 ATLAS simulator, Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar (MABEL), and passive optical imagery from Landsat-8 using an existing spectral-ratio algorithm. The output bathymetric data set agrees with high-resolution Fugro LADS MK II bathymetric data to within an RMS difference of 1.1 m.

In this paper, it is proposed that three-dimensional points and four-dimensional lines are uniformly represented by Plücker coordinates to achieve integrated coordinate transformation. According to the geometric conditions that lines intersect lines and planes intersect planes, a relative orientation model based on pointline via Plücker coordinates (P-LPRO) is established, and the error equation is linearized by the least-squares method. Experimental results show that the integrated adjustment solution of P-LPRO is more accurate than the traditional method and can achieve faster convergence speed."

To solve these problems, we initially propose an innovative image-pyramid-based raster-to-vector conversion (IPBRTVC) framework with quality control for consecutive-scale cartography and synchronized generalization, of which details can be modified accordingly under the IPBRTVC framework. Landsat-8 imagery and Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)/Operational Linescan System (OLS) night-time light imagery are used as a test dataset to extract classic objects in the geometry level. Experimental results show that the IPBRTVC framework not only solves the aforementioned problems well but also (1) improves efficiency of data processing by avoiding problems of corresponding features matching and topology errors, (2) contributes to develop relevant parallel computing system, and (3) helps to integrate the raster-to-vector conversion and consecutive-scale cartography."
"Land Cover Classification in Combined Elevation and Optical Images Supported by OSM Data, Mixed-level Features, and Non-local Optimization Algorithms","Bulatov, Dimitri; Häufel, Gisela; Lucks, Lukas; Pohl, Melanie",pp. 179-195(17),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2019/00000085/00000003/art00012;jsessionid=bsppvri8co0a.x-ic-live-01,"Land cover classification from airborne data is considered a challenging task in Remote Sensing. Even in the case of available elevation data, shadows and strong intra-class variations of appearances are abundant in urban terrain. In this paper, we propose an approach for supervised land cover classification that has three main contributions. Firstly, for the cumbersome task of training data sampling we propose an algorithm which combines the freely available OpenStreetMap data with the actual sensor data and requires only a minimum of user interaction. The key idea of this algorithm is to rasterize the vector data using a fast segmentation result. Secondly, pixel-wise classification may take long and be quite sensitive to the resolution and quality of input data. Therefore, superpixel decomposition of images, supported by a general framework on operations with superpixels, guarantees fast grouping of pixel-wise features and their assignment to one of four important classes (building, tree, grass and road). Particularly for extraction of street canyons lying in the shadowy regions, high-level features based on stripes are introduced. Finally, the output of a probabilistic learning algorithm can be postprocessed by a non-local optimization module operating on Markov Random Fields, thus allowing to correct noisy results using a smoothness prior. Extensive tests on three datasets of quite different nature have been performed with two probabilistic learners: The well-known Random Forest and by far less known Import Vector Machine are explored. Thus, this work provides insights about promising feature sets for both classifiers. The quantitative results for the ISPRS benchmark dataset Vaihingen are promising, achieving up to 94.5% and 87.1% accuracy on superpixel and on pixel level, respectively, despite the fact that only around 10% of available labeled data were used. At the same time, the results for two additional datasets, validated with the autonomously acquired training data, yielded a significantly lower number of misclassified superpixels. This confirms that the proposed algorithm on training data extraction works quite well in reducing errors of second kind. However, it tends to extract predominantly huge and easy-to-classify areas, while in complicated, ambiguous regions, first type errors often occur. For this and other algorithm shortcomings, directions of future research are outlined."
Improved Camera Distortion Correction and Depth Estimation for Lenslet Light Field Camera,"Yang, Changkun; Liu, Zhaoqin; Di, Kaichang; Wang, Yexin; Peng, Man",pp. 197-208(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2019/00000085/00000003/art00014;jsessionid=bsppvri8co0a.x-ic-live-01,"A light field camera can capture both radiance and angular information, providing a novel solution for depth estimation. The paper proposes two improved methods including distortion model optimization and depth estimation refinement for a lenslet light field camera. For distortion model optimization, a novel 14-parameter distortion model that involves sub-aperture images generation is applied to correct the light field camera images. For depth estimation refinement, an algorithm reducing the high influence of outliers on depth estimation in weak texture regions is proposed based on multi-view stereo matching using the cost volume. Experimental results show the projection error has decreased by about 30% and the depth root-mean-squared error on real world images has decreased by about 42% with our distortion correction method and depth estimation method compared with state of art algorithms. It verifies the correctness and effectiveness of our proposed methods and show significant improvement on accuracy of depth map estimation."
Analysis and Correction of Digital Elevation Models for Plain Areas,"Ochoa, Cristian Guevara; Vives, Luis; Zimmermann, Erik; Masson, Ignacio; Fajardo, Luisa; Scioli, Carlos",pp. 209-219(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2019/00000085/00000003/art00015;jsessionid=bsppvri8co0a.x-ic-live-01,"Water movement modeling in plain areas requires digital elevation models (DEMs) adequately representing the morphological and geomorphological land patterns including the presence of civil structures that could affect water flow patterns. This has a direct effect on water accumulation and water flow direction. The objectives of this work were to analyze, compare and improve DEMs so surface water movement in plain areas could be predicted. In order to do that, we evaluated the accuracy of a digital elevation data set consisting in 4064 points measured with a differential global positioning system (GPS) in a plain area of central Buenos Aires province. Three DEMs were analyzed: (1) the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), (2) the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and (3) the Advanced Land Observing Satellite with the Phased Array Type L-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS PALSAR). Several topographic attributes (i.e., height, surface area, land slope, delimitation of geomorphological units, civil structures, basin boundaries and streams network) and different interpolation methods were analyzed. The results showed that both the SRTM and the ALOS PALSAR DEMs had a ± 4.4 m root mean square error (RMSE) in contrast to the ASTER DEM which had a ± 9 m RMSE. Our analysis proved that the best DEM representing the study area is the SRTM. The most suitable interpolation methods applied to the SRTM were the inverse distance weighting and the ANUDEM, whereas the spline method displayed the lowest vertical accuracy. With the proposed method we obtained a DEM for the study area with a ± 3.2 m RMSE, a 33% error reduction compared to the raw DEM."
An Evaluation of Reflectance Calibration Methods for UAV Spectral Imagery,"Edwards, Jarrod; Anderson, John; Shuart, William; Woolard, Jason",pp. 221-230(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2019/00000085/00000003/art00016;jsessionid=bsppvri8co0a.x-ic-live-01,"Spectral imagery using micro-unmanned aerial vehicles is rapidly advancing. This study compared reflectance calibration methods for imagery acquired using the Parrot Sequoia imager, a commercial multispectral sensor package. For the study, two orthomosaics were calibrated using 1) a manufacturer-suggested AIRINOV standard correction using PIX4D software and 2) the Empirical Line Calibration (ELC) method using ground radiometric data on specific in-scene targets. Both scenes were analyzed for target spectral agreement by ground radiometric survey. Regression analysis demonstrated more favorable target correlation for the ELC imagery than the AIRINOV-calibrated imagery, with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) analysis supporting these results. Finally, classification maps were produced between the data sets. Error analysis resulted in an overall accuracy of 24% for the AIRINOV map compared to ELC-based truth data, with a considerable number of pixels associated with brighter targets unclassified. These results demonstrate the need for standardized calibration procedures in the spectral correction of small-format remote sensor data."
Interaction Relationship Between Built-Up Land Expansion and Demographic-Social-Economic Urbanization in Shanghai-Hangzhou Bay Metropolitan Region of Eastern China,"Xiao, Rui; Huang, Xin; Yu, Weixuan; Lin, Meng; Zhang, Zhonghao",pp. 231-240(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2019/00000085/00000003/art00017;jsessionid=bsppvri8co0a.x-ic-live-01,"Employing coupling coordination degree model (CCDM), this research attempts to reveal the interaction relationships between built-up land expansion (BLE) and demographic-social-economic (DSE) urbanization in Shanghai–Hangzhou Bay (SHB) Metropolitan Region. It first compared the development trends of four elements, including built-up land expansion level, demographic urbanization, social urbanization, and economic urbanization from 1994 to 2015 through descriptive statistics. Then CCDM was used to identify the spiral escalation trend relationships between built-up land expansion and demographic/social/economic urbanization, respectively. The findings revealed that the degree of coupling coordination between BLE and DSE urbanization had the trend to ascend in SHB, and Shanghai has a more superior balanced development tendency than other cities. It concludes that CCDM can be implemented as an effective approach to evaluate the coupling relationship, and the related agencies in SHB can strengthen the coordination to provide suggestions and make decisions for the coordinated development of urban agglomeration."
Repeated Structure Detection for 3D Reconstruction of Building Façade from Mobile Lidar Data,"Chen, Yanming; Liu, Xiaoqiang; Yao, Mengru; Deng, Shulin; Li, Feixue; Cheng, Liang; Li, Manchun",pp. 93-108(16),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2019/00000085/00000002/art00011;jsessionid=2gd3j8xfo480x.x-ic-live-03,"This study proposes a new method for repeated structure detection and the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of building façades from mobile lidar data. Firstly, the building façade is divided and unrolled to simplify the complex façade structures, improving the automation of structure detection and building reconstruction. Subsequently, the unrolled façade is decomposed into tiles by analyzing the repeated structures. Tiles with strong similarities are matched and merged to restore the imperfect façade points. Based on the restored points and repeated structures, a 3D building façade can be reconstructed with a complete structure and fine detail. An analysis is conducted to compare the constructed 3D model with the lidar points of actual façade. The results of this analysis demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively deal with missing areas caused by occlusion, viewpoint limitation, and uneven point density, as well as realizing the highly complete 3D reconstruction of a building façade."

The goal of this study is to evaluate how increasing Landsat temporal repeat frequency might achieve weekly cloud-free observations. This is a case study which examines eastern United States observations, as a typical representation of the temperate forest biome. A comparison between simultaneous Landsat and MODIS observations shows that MODIS observations provide a reasonable approximation of observed Landsat cloud cover conditions. Daily MODIS cloud observations are examined, using image compositing, to evaluate how increasing Landsat temporal repeat frequency might reduce weekly Landsat cloud contamination. Results suggests that for these eastern US locations weekly clear views are best achieved with daily satellite repeat frequency, bi-weekly clear views with 2-day repeat, monthly clear views are achieved with 4-day repeat and seasonal clear views with 8-day repeat. To more fully understand the global impact of cloud contamination on Landsat observations similar studies are needed for the Earth's other major biomes."

The purpose of this study is to establish the spatiotemporal data fusion model, the Hierarchical Bayesian Model (HBM) based on Robust Fixed Rank Filter (R-FRF), that merge Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) SST with 4-km resolution and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) SST with 25-km resolution through their spatiotemporal complementarity to obtain fusion SST with complete coverage, high spatial resolution, and fine spatial pattern. First, a bias correction model was applied to correct satellite SST. Second, a spatiotemporal model called R-FRF was established to model potential spatiotemporal process of SST. Third, the R-FRF model was embedded in the hierarchical Bayesian framework, and the corrected MODIS and AMSR-E SST are merged. Finally, the accuracy, spatial pattern and spatial completeness of the fusion SST were assessed. The results of this study are the following: (a) It is necessary to carry out bias correction before data fusion. (b) The R-FRF model could simulate SST spatiotemporal trend well. (c) Fusion SST has similar accuracy and spatial pattern to MODIS SST. Though the accuracy is lower than that of the AMSR-E SST, the fusion SST has more local detail information. The results indicated that fusion SST with higher accuracy, finer spatial pattern, and complete coverage can be obtained through HBM based on R-FRF. Index Terms: Hierarchical Bayesian Model based on R-FRF; MODIS SST; AMSR-E SST; scale transformation; local variance."

The examination of bare earth lidar error within the experiment site revealed a complex association between accuracy and environment within the coastal landscape. Accuracy was constrained to better than 50 cm RMSE in areas with vegetated dune topography and, overall, a 38.9 cm RMSE was measured. Higher accuracies were achieved in the flat, non-vegetated beach. A three-dimensional minimization of residuals between the lidar and GPS surveys reduced the total RMSE to 25.2 cm, indicating a correctable systematic offset between the surface generated from the lidar and the true ground surface."
Ground-Level Ozone Concentration and Landscape Patterns in China's Urban Areas,"Li, Jiayi; Huang, Xin",pp. 145-152(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2019/00000085/00000002/art00015;jsessionid=2gd3j8xfo480x.x-ic-live-03,"We monitored the spatio-temporal distribution of urban population-weighted ozone for 2014–2017 to investigate ground-level pollution in China. During the study period, the national average was 88.68±10.4 μg/m3for O3-8h, and 5.27% of the days that exceed the 160 μg/m3standard. Pollution hotspots in the Tibetan Plateau are mainly attributed to natural factors, while those in the North China Plain (NCP), Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and Pearl River Delta (PRD) are more closely related to anthropogenic activities. The results indicate that the ozone pollution and its correlations with the landscape are influenced by the ozone regime and climatic factors. In the Yangtze Plain and to its south, pollution in the ozone episodes is related to both population size and heterogeneity. For the Yangtze Plain and its southern urban areas in transitional ozone regimes, sprawl, contiguity, compactness, and the size of the urban area also facilitate the accumulation of pollution."

Given a binary image representing the road class, centerlines of road segments are extracted by means of skeletonization. The focus of this paper lies in a well-reasoned representation of these segments by means of geometric primitives, such as straight line segments as well as circle and ellipse arcs. Thereby, we aim at a fusion of raw segments to longer chains which better match to the intuitive perception of what a street is. We propose a two-step approach for simultaneous chain-forming and generalization. First, we obtain an over-segmentation of the raw polylines. Then, a model selection approach is applied to decide whether two neighboring segments should be fused to a new geometric entity. For this purpose, we propose an iterative greedy optimization procedure in order to find a strong minimum of a cost function based on a Bayesian information criterion. Starting at the given initial raw segments, we thus can obtain a set of chains describing long alleys and important roundabouts. Within the procedure, topological attributes, such as junctions and neighborhood structures, are consistently updated, in a way that for the greedy optimization procedure, accuracy, model complexity, and topology are considered simultaneously. The results on two challenging datasets indicate the benefits of the proposed procedure and provide ideas for future work."

The approach goes beyond traditional gross-level classification (roads, buildings, trees, noise) by enriching the point cloud metadata with detailed semantic information about the object type. The approach was evaluated using two datasets of differing point density, separated by eight years for the same study area in Dublin, Ireland. As evaluated against manually classified data, classification quality ranged from 76% to 91% depending upon category and only 8% remained unclassified, as opposed to the commercial vendor's classification quality which ranged from 43% to 78% with 82% left unclassified."

Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), are cross-combined to initialize the calibrated model.

To fully explore the satellite images, we propose aITDDmethod using the orthophoto and digital surface model (DSM) derived from the multi-view satellite data. Our algorithm utilizes the top-hat morphological operation to efficiently extract the local maxima fromDSMas treetops, and then feed them to a modified superpixel segmentation that combines both 2D and 3D information for tree crown delineation. In subsequent steps, our method incorporates the biological characteristics of the crowns through plant allometric equation to falsify potential outliers. Experiments against manually marked tree plots on three representative regions have demonstrated promising results – the best overall detection accuracy can be 89%."

The hyperspectral-based cellulose absorption index (CAI) is an accepted method for estimating the cover fractions ofNPV. However, the spaceborne hyperspectral data currently available to us are very limited. In this study, we tried to identify one or more combinations based on the multispectral vegetation indices feature space model to quantitatively estimate thePV,NPVand bare soil fractions of the Otindag Sandy Land in northern China. Three frequently-used green vegetation indices,NDVI,EVIandOSAVI, and nine multispectral-based indices sensitive toNPVwere used to examine the spatial patterns based on the field measured endmember spectra and non-growing and growing season Landsat-8OLIimage reflectance spectra. The capabilities of these different combinations were tested in this study area using mosaicked Landsat-8OLIimagery. The results show that the feature space of different combinations based on the field measured spectra and image reflectance spectra has good consistency. The separability of feature space determines the availability of this model. The normalized difference senescent vegetation index (NDSVI) and brightness index (BI) were found to have greater potential to combine with the three selected green vegetation indices for simultaneous estimation of the fractional cover of PV,NPV, and bare soil in the Otindag Sandy Land because of their clear and separable feature space. We obtained the best and medium-precision estimates forNDVI-NDSVI(fPV:RMSE=0.26; fNPV:RMSE=0.17) andOSAVI-BI(fPV:RMSE=0.27; fNPV:RMSE=0.25) for 104 field observations."

A comparison among ordinary least squares (OLS), geographically weighted regression (GWR), geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) and the proposed IGTWR indicate that the IGTWR model has the best prediction performance for PM2.5 concentrations with highest R2 (0.752) and smallest RMSE (9.651μg/m3). The annual mean PM2.5 distribution at 500 m resolution over Hong Kong from 2012 to 2014 is derived using IGTWR, demonstrating its potential of satellite-based PM2.5 monitoring."

These two features are then integrated using a multivariable linear regression model to estimate impervious surfaces. The proposed method has been tested in the main urban area of Guangzhou, China, in pixel level and parcel level, respectively. The obtained results, with the overall RMSE of 10.98% and 10.90% for pixel level and parcel level, respectively, demonstrate the good performance of integrating remote sensing imagery and social data for mapping of urban impervious surface."

Spatial co-registration of panoramic hyperspectral images was performed using homologous points automatically extracted by the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm. The effect of input image selection on identifying homologous points and different transformation techniques on image co-registration were evaluated. Although proper spatial image co-registration was expected to provide persistent spectral data, spectral concatenation of the hyperspectral images required characterizing and correcting the errors and inconsistencies due to camera sensor properties and limitations. Bringing spectral data from two hyperspectral cameras together provided the opportunity to identify and differentiate lithological units, which would not have been possible using a single sensor, and thus allow more detailed and extended spectral analysis of near-vertical outcrops."

However, the theoretical precision of affine compensation and drift compensation is still unclear. In this research, a stereo pair-based block adjustment model for HRSIs is developed, in which the block adjustment can be simplified to orientation in steps. The impact of the number and arrangement of tie points on precision is described, and it is proved that when affine compensation is applied, the cofactors grow exponentially with the number of strips. After eliminating the samplerelated compensated parameters, the theoretical precision of the drift compensation model becomes independent of lateral overlap. With four strips of ZY3 images, the experiment shows that the drift compensation model can achieve homogeneous accuracy with four ground control points at the corners of the entire block; nevertheless, the geolocation errors of an affine compensation model differ from strip to strip."

The spectral feature parameter method is widely applied to estimate the relative chlorophyll content of wheat. To provide a scientific basis for wheat growth monitoring and agronomic decision-making, we estimated the relative chlorophyll content using hyperspectral technology. During the summer of 2017, we collected canopy reflectance spectra using field spectroscopy along with the relative chlorophyll content of wheat. To comprehensively analyze the field-collected hyperspectral data, various band combinations were used to calculate a simple spectral index (ratio spectral index, RSI), normalized difference spectral index (NDSI) and chlorophyll index (CI). We compared simple spectral indices with 17 different indices from the literature. The relationships between the indices and relative chlorophyll content were then examined, and the strongest relationships were demonstrated. The partial least squares regression (PLSR) method was utilized to develop a predictive model of the relative chlorophyll content. The newly identified NDSIs, RSIs, and CIs always performed better than the spectral indices from previous studies, and the relative chlorophyll content exhibited the highest correlations with RSI (R849 nm, R850 nm), CI (R849 nm, R850 nm), and NDSI (R849 nm, R850 nm), calculated using leaf reflectance spectra (|r| ≥ 0.7). The -model revealed that the highest R2Pre (0.74) and lowest RMSEPre (2.72 SPAD) were identified with four optimized chlorophyll indices (CI (R849 nm, R850 nm), CI (R539 nm, R553 nm), CI (R540 nm, R553 nm), and CI (R536 nm, R553 nm)). The spatial information from these parameters will aid the proper nutrient management of optimal spring wheat crop growth and forecasting models for a precision wheat agriculture system."
"Coupling Relationship Among Scale Parameter, Segmentation Accuracy, and Classification Accuracy In GeOBIA","Ming, Dongping; Zhou, Wen; Xu, Lu; Wang, Min; Ma, Yanni",pp. 681-693(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2018/00000084/00000011/art00009;jsessionid=6p3s1pm0hxn7.x-ic-live-02,"The quality of multi-scale segmentation mainly consists of intrasegment homogeneity and intersegment heterogeneity; however, it is difficult to synchronously get both high. It is crucial to make it clear which one of these two measures is more important and what is the coupling relationship among segmentation scale parameter, image segmentation and classification accuracy. This paper employs series of segmentation and classification to show that (1) intrasegment homogeneity is more important than intersegment heterogeneity in GeOBIA; there is always highly positive correlation between intrasegment homogeneity and classification accuracy; (2) with the increase of spectral heterogeneity parameter, both image object amount and the intrasegment homogeneity decrease; however the intersegment heterogeneity increases or increases first then decrease after the appropriate scale; and (3) the appropriate scale means there is a compromise between intrasegment homogeneity and intersegment heterogeneity. The research findings are helpful to raise awareness among practitioners who suffer from scale issues in GeOBIA."
Characterizing Urban Landscape by Using Fractal-based Texture Information,"Liang, Bingqing; Weng, Qihao",pp. 695-710(16),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2018/00000084/00000011/art00011;jsessionid=6p3s1pm0hxn7.x-ic-live-02,"This study examined the potential of integrating fractal texture with spectral information on urban landscape characterization by the maximum likelihood image classifier. The fractal texture was first derived from the red band of a Landsat ETM+ image by applying the triangular prism algorithm at different window sizes. The quality of the twenty-five resultant texture bands were then analyzed by fourteen approaches at both of the pre- and post-classification stages. Results showed all evaluations employed at the pre-classification stage are useful to screen out texture bands more useful than others to facilitate the later supervised image classification. This texture information is observed useful only for classifying medium- and low- density residential categories. The window size leading to the best overall classification accuracy is identified as 31 × 31, implying this scale should be kept as a guideline for future studies if a similar methodology is adopted."

Tea Garden Detection from High-Resolution Imagery Using a Scene-Based Framework,"Huang, Xin; Zhu, Zerun; Li, Yansheng; Wu, Bo; Yang, Michael",pp. 723-731(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2018/00000084/00000011/art00013;jsessionid=6p3s1pm0hxn7.x-ic-live-02,"Tea cultivation has a long history in China, and it is one of the pillar industries of the Chinese agricultural economy. It is therefore necessary to map tea gardens for their ongoing management. However, the previous studies have relied on fieldwork to achieve this task, which is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a framework to map tea gardens using high-resolution remotely sensed imagery, including three scene-based methods: the bag-of-visual-words (BOVW) model, supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (sLDA), and the unsupervised convolutional neural network (UCNN). These methods can develop direct and holistic semantic representations for tea garden scenes composed of multiple sub-objects, thus they are more suitable than the traditional pixel-based or object-based methods, which focus on the local characteristics of pixels or objects. In the experiments undertaken in this study, the three different methods were tested on four datasets from Longyan (Oolong tea), Hangzhou (Longjing tea), and Puer (Puer tea). All the methods achieved a good performance, both quantitatively and visually, and the UCNN outperformed the other methods. Moreover, it was found that the addition of textural features improved the accuracy of the BOVW and sLDA models, but had no effect on the UCNN."

In this paper, an efficient heterogeneous ensemble algorithm, i.e., the stacked generalization (SG) combined with image segmentation, is proposed to construct a simple multi-classifier ensemble system that can offer better detection accuracy with lower computational cost. Due to the rich spatial information in high-spatial-resolution remote sensing images, structure texture (morphological) and statistical texture features are extracted to construct the input data to the ensemble system along with spectral features. In addition, constrained analysis on segmented objects integrates the smaller heterogeneity segmentation map and pixel-wise change map to generate the final change map. The experiments were carried out on two ZY-3 and a QuickBird dataset. The results show that the proposed algorithm can integrate the advantages of both pixel-wise ensemble and object-oriented methods, and effectively improve the accuracy and stability of change detection."

The main advantage of the new method is that the problem solution does not require any initial value of the planetary rover's pose parameters, or any linearization procedure. Moreover, the new method takes account of the problem that the coefficient matrix and observation vector of the relative orientation model should also be considered with regard to error during optimization. The results from China's first lunar rover and simulated stereo camera system demonstrate that the new method can enable the planetary rover to run in real time and achieve equal localization accuracy (with a mean relative localization accuracy of 4.59%), higher efficiency (with a computation time of 1 ms) and direct convergence compared with some classical methods."

At the core of these systems is the direct georeferencing techniques that tie together multi-sensor data on-board. An important aspect of direct georeferencing is to apply accurate boresight calibration of individual sensors with respect to the platform body frame. Conventional techniques use Ground Control Points (GCP) for this calibration. Considering the challenges in identifyingGCPsfrom low density lidar point cloud, this research presents a feature-based registration method that uses control planes. The presented method is performed in a lab-facility utilizing static data to determine the alignment between platform body frame and lidar frame by minimizing the volume formed between low point density lidar and control planes.

Therefore, reviewing segmentation evaluation methods used for high spatial resolution remote sensing images is of great significance. This paper summarizes widely used evaluation methods in remote sensing field, analyzes their advantages and shortcomings, and discusses their application range. Especially this paper uses series of experiments to demonstrate the supervised and unsupervised image segmentation evaluation process and analyzes the performance of some commonly used supervised and unsupervised evaluation indexes.

To thoroughly analyze the footprint geolocation errors, mathematical models of Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) of laser footprint geolocation are established based on footprint geolocation procedure and principle of error propagation. Taking Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) as an example, the influences of surface slope and roughness on theRMSEof laser footprint geolocation (LFG) are simulated. The simulation results for nine representative terrains indicate that the horizontal errors are constant of 5.86 meters that mainly caused by instrument mounting errors, laser pointing errors, and platform attitude errors; while the vertical error increases from 0.07 m to 2.49 m, which is primarily contributed by the laser pointing error. To validate the proposed mathematical model, 20 referenceLFGdifferences are computed by the differences of original geolocation ofGLASand refined footprint geolocation based on a waveform matching method with coincident airborne Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) data. The validated results prove that theRMSEmodels of laser footprint geolocation are applicable in evaluating performance and sensor error allocations of spaceborne laser altimeter."

We found an apparent increase in the total area of the lakes (increased by 4616.7 ± 296.3 km2). The increasing trend in lake area has been particularly pronounced in the Tibetan Plateau Lake-zone (TPL) and Xinjiang primarily due to increased precipitation and glacier/snow melting under global warming, although significant downward trends (P <0.05) in lake area occurred in eastern and northeastern China and Inner Mongolia, dominantly driven by anthropogenic activities. There are significant negative relationships between relative lake area and irrigated area, built-up land, and number of water projects in the East and the Northeast China Plain (P <0.05). This study provides a crucial basis for continuous investigation and protection of China's lakes."

The southeastern U.S. in particular is changing rapidly, but a long-term, consistentLCLUhistory at fine spatial resolution does not exist for the region. Here, we present a newLCLUhistory of the southeastern U.S. based on temporal extension of the 2011 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) back to 1986. We used Automatic Adaptive Signature Generalization (AASG) to generate this product from Landsat TM/ETM+ imagery and ancillary topographic information. AASG identifies stable sites between two images and uses these stable sites to generate a new training dataset for updating a classification from one date to the next. Our long-termLCLUclassifications are broadly consistent with theNLCDwhile providing a much longer historical record for characterizing recent changes in the southeastern U.S. and contextualizing their consequences for ecosystem services in the region."

By the use of the proposed phase correlation based tracking method and other advanced image processing algorithms, a practical videogrammetric measurement system is presented to provide an alternative means to monitor and analyze 3D structural vibration deformations. Two simulated tests as well as one static test are performed to demonstrate the superiority and reliability of the proposed phase correlation method.

Conventional geometric calibration, which uses high-accuracy ground control data to accurately calibrate the orientation parameters of a satellite, heavily relies on the control data of the calibration fields and may not be applicable in emergencies where urgent and accurate positioning is needed. The constant calibration of satellites is also difficult owing to the lack of permanent calibration fields. This paper presents a geometric cross-calibration method for the rapid and accurate calibration of satellites. The conjugate points from the multitemporal images of one satellite or multi-satellite images are first automatically extracted; then, the interior orientation parameters of the satellite requiring calibration can be precisely recovered according to the positioning consistency constraint of the conjugate points. In contrast to the conventional method, the proposed method can accurately calibrate the orientation parameters without using high-accuracy control data of the calibration fields. Therefore, the proposed method aids in the constant calibration of satellites to ensure the positioning accuracy, even without sufficient permanent calibration fields. The multitemporal images of the Yaogan-4 satellite and the images of the ZY3-01 and ZY02C satellites were considered for verifying this method. Finally, accuracies of approximately 0.7 and 0.6 pixels were achieved by the proposed and conventional methods, respectively. The difference between the two methods was only approximately 0.1 pixels, demonstrating that the proposed method can achieve a calibration accuracy as high as that achieved by the conventional method, even without the use of high-accuracy control data."

Although many researchers have integrated lidar-derived tree height and crown size metrics to improve tree species classification accuracy, these simple biophysical attributes provide inadequate explanatory power in distinguishing ash trees (Fraxinus, spp.) in urban ecosystems. To address this issue, shape-related features, including crown shape index (SI) and coefficient of variation (CV) of crown height, were extracted from lidar data, and fused with treetopbased spectra for ash tree species identification in Milwaukee City, Wisconsin, United States. Analysis results indicate shape features includingSIandCVplay a big role in improving the accuracy for ash tree identification. Specifically, Fusion ofCVand treetop-based spectra improved the overall accuracy from 81.9 percent to 89 percent, and McNemar tests indicated the differences in accuracy betweenCVfusion and tree height fusion was statistically significant (p = 0.016)."

The study site in Maryland included coniferous and deciduous trees associated with agricultural fields and pastures, residential and commercial buildings, roads, parking lots, wetlands, and forests. The forest cover indices exploited the product of either the reflectance in red (630 to 690 nm) and red edge (705 to 745 nm) bands or the product of reflectance in red and near infrared (770 to 895 nm) bands. For two classes (trees versus other), overall classification accuracy was >77 percent for the four images that were acquired in each season of the year.

Firstly, a detector, with the feature response function considering geometric distinctiveness of image pixel as well as the support region surrounding the pixel, is proposed to detect local distinctive features. Secondly, those features with higher distinctiveness are selected as seed points and matched. A matching reliability indicator is proposed to select reliable seed matches. Then, a coarse geometric transformation is computed based on the seed matches to define a corresponding search area for each feature. Finally, a feeble interest point searching strategy is adopted to find correspondence for all the features. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to obtain much more correct matches than traditional methods, as well as the highest matching precision (around 90 percent) in the comparative evaluations for remote sensing images with highly repetitive patterns."

Comparison of different datasets provided a method for evaluating spatial distribution of minerals in the samples. Dominant minerals in the alteration zone included galena, chalcopyrite, pyrite, and azurite. The high-resolution imaging spectroscopy data were evaluated using the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. AlthoughSVMyielded fewer unclassified pixels,SAMgave superior classification results and distribution estimates, particularly for sulfide minerals, which exhibit lower overall reflectance profiles.

In both datasets, theBLSTMmethod achieves competitive classification performances compared to three other deep learning methods. By using the proposedODCS, our method can use only ²/³ of the entire dataset to achieve 74.6 percent F-score for the patch sequence classification and 72.0 percent F-score for the image sequence classification."
On a Novel 360° Panoramic Stereo Mobile Mapping System,"Blaser, Stefan; Nebiker, Stephan; Cavegn, Stefan",pp. 347-356(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2018/00000084/00000006/art00011;jsessionid=9y3d8y14atwu.x-ic-live-01,"Image-based mobile mapping systems enable the efficient acquisition of georeferenced image sequences, which can later be exploited in cloud-based 3D geoinformation services. In order to provide a 360° coverage with accurate 3D measuring capabilities, we present a novel 360° panoramic stereo camera configuration. By using two 360° panorama cameras tilted forward and backward in combination with conventional forward and backward looking stereo camera sytems, we achieve a full 360° multi-stereo coverage. We furthermore developed a new mobile mapping system based on our proposed approach, which is operational and fulfills our high accuracy requirements. We successfully implemented a rigorous sensor and system calibration procedure, which allows calibrating all stereo systems with a superior accuracy compared to that of previous work. Our study delivered absolute 3D point accuracies in the range of 2 to 8 cm and relative accuracies of 3D distances in the range of 1 to 5 cm. We achieved these results in a challenging urban area. Furthermore, we automatically reconstructed a 3D city model of our study area by employing all captured and georeferenced mobile mapping imagery. The result is a highly detailed and almost complete 3D city model of the street-level environment."
Finding Timestamp Offsets for a Multi-Sensor System Using Sensor Observations,"Voges, Raphael; Wieghardt, Christian S.; Wagner, Bernardo",pp. 357-366(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2018/00000084/00000006/art00012;jsessionid=9y3d8y14atwu.x-ic-live-01,"Multi-sensor systems are widely used for robotics applications. While additional sensors can increase the accuracy and robustness of the solution, it is inevitable to synchronize them in order to rely on the results. For our multi-sensor system consisting of an actuated laser scanner, its motor and a camera, we assume that the timestamps are only delayed by a constant offset. We propose two different approaches to calculate timestamp offsets from laser scanner to motor, one of which is additionally capable of determining the timestamp offset between laser scanner and camera. Both approaches use parts of a SLAM algorithm but apply different criteria to find an appropriate solution. Our experiments show that we are able to determine timestamp offsets with a reasonable accuracy. Furthermore, our experiments exhibit the significance of a proper synchronization for a multi-sensor system."
Range-Image: Incorporating Sensor Topology for Lidar Point Cloud Processing,"Biasutti, P.; Aujol, J-F.; Brédif, M.; Bugeau, A.",pp. 367-375(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2018/00000084/00000006/art00013;jsessionid=9y3d8y14atwu.x-ic-live-01,"This paper proposes a novel methodology for lidar point cloud processing that takes advantage of the implicit topology of various lidar sensors to derive 2D images from the point cloud while bringing spatial structure to each point. The interest of such a methodology is then proved by addressing the problems of segmentation and disocclusion of mobile objects in 3D lidar scenes acquired using street-based Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS). Most of the existing lines of research tackle those problems directly in the 3D space. This work promotes an alternative approach by using this image representation of the 3D point cloud, taking advantage of the fact that the problem of disocclusion has been intensively studied in the 2D image processing community over the past decade. Using the image derived from the sensor data by exploiting the sensor topology, a semi-automatic segmentation procedure based on depth histograms is presented. Then, a variational image inpainting technique is introduced to reconstruct the areas that are occluded by objects. Experiments and validation on real data prove the effectiveness of this methodology both in terms of accuracy and speed."
A Voxel- and Graph-Based Strategy for Segmenting Man-Made Infrastructures Using Perceptual Grouping Laws: Comparison and Evaluation,"Xu, Yusheng; Hoegner, Ludwig; Tuttas, Sebastian; Stilla, Uwe",pp. 377-391(15),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2018/00000084/00000006/art00015;jsessionid=9y3d8y14atwu.x-ic-live-01,"In this paper, we report a novel strategy for segmenting 3D point clouds using a voxel structure and graph-based clustering with perceptual grouping laws. It provides a completely automatic solution for partitioning point clouds of man-made infrastructure. Two different segmentation methods using voxel and supervoxel structures are presented and evaluated. To increase the efficiency and the robustness of the segmentation process, the voxelization with octree-based structure is introduced, which can suppress effects of noise, outliers, and unevenly distributed point densities as well. The clustering of over-segmented voxels and supervoxels is achieved using graph theory on the basis of the local contextual information, which is commonly conducted merely with pairwise information in conventional clustering algorithms. The graphical model is constructed according to perceptual grouping laws, considering geometric information associated with points. Experiments using both laser scanning and photogrammetric point clouds have demonstrated that the proposed methods can achieve good results, especially complex scenes and nonplanar object surfaces, with F1-measures better than 0.67 for all the testing samples. Quantitative comparisons between the proposed approaches and other representative segmentation methods also confirm the effectiveness and the efficiency of the former. Moreover, a series of experiments is carried out, to investigate the methods' sensitivity with respect to various parameters on the segmentation results."
Geometric Reasoning with Uncertain Polygonal Faces,"Meidow, Jochen; Förstner, Wolfgang",pp. 393-401(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2018/00000084/00000006/art00017;jsessionid=9y3d8y14atwu.x-ic-live-01,"The reconstruction of urban areas suffers from the dilemma of modeling urban structures in a generic or specific way, thus being too unspecific or too restrictive. One approach to overcome this dilemma is to model and to instantiate buildings as arbitrarily shaped polyhedra and to recognize man-made structures in a subsequent stage by geometric reasoning. Thus, the existence of unconstrained boundary representations for buildings is assumed. To stay generic and to avoid the use of templates for pre-defined building primitives, no assumptions for the buildings' outlines and the planar roof areas are made. Typically, roof areas are derived interactively or in an automatic process based on given point clouds or digital surface models. Due to the measurement process and the assumption of planar boundaries, these planar faces are uncertain. Thus, a stochastic geometric reasoning process with statistical testing is appropriate to detected man-made structures followed by an adjustment to enforce the deduced geometric constraints. Unfortunately, city models usually do not feature information about the uncertainty of geometric entities. We present an approach to specify the uncertainty of the planes corresponding to the planar patches, i.e., polygons bounding a building, analytically. This paves the way to conduct the reasoning process with just a few assumptions. We describe and demonstrate the approach with real data."
Unsupervised Source Selection for Domain Adaptation,"Vogt, Karsten; Paul, Andreas; Ostermann, Jörn; Rottensteiner, Franz; Heipke, Christian",pp. 249-261(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2018/00000084/00000005/art00013;jsessionid=tikv08egoq3e.x-ic-live-02,"The creation of training sets for supervised machine learning often incurs unsustainable manual costs. Transfer learning (TL) techniques have been proposed as a way to solve this issue by adapting training data from different, but related (source) datasets to the test (target) dataset. A problem inTLis how to quantify the relatedness of a source quickly and robustly. In this work, we present a fast domain similarity measure that captures the relatedness between datasets purely based on unlabeled data. Our method transfers knowledge from multiple sources by generating a weighted combination of domains. We show for multiple datasets that learning on such sources achieves an average overall accuracy closer than 2.5 percent to the results of the target classifier for semantic segmentation tasks. We further apply our method to the task of choosing informative patches from unlabeled datasets. Only labeling these patches enables a reduction in manual work of up to 85 percent."
Multitemporal Classification Under Label Noise Based on Outdated Maps,"Maas, Alina E.; Rottensteiner, Franz; Alobeid, Abdalla; Heipke, Christian",pp. 263-277(15),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2018/00000084/00000005/art00014;jsessionid=tikv08egoq3e.x-ic-live-02,"Supervised classification of remotely sensed images is a classical method for change detection. The task requires training data in the form of image data with known class labels. If the training labels are acquired from an outdated map, the classifier must cope with errors in the training labels. These errors (label noise) typically occur in clusters in object space, because they are caused by land cover changes over time. In this paper we adapt a label noise tolerant training technique for classification, so that the fact that changes affect larger clusters of pixels is considered. We also integrate the existing map into an iterative classification procedure to act as a priori in regions which are likely to contain changes. Additionally we expand the model for multitemporal data, making it applicable for time series. Our experiments are based on four test areas, including a multitemporal example. Our results show that this method helps to distinguish between real changes over time and false detections caused by misclassification and thus improve the accuracy of the classification results."
Archetypal Analysis for Sparse Representation-Based Hyperspectral Sub-pixel Quantification,"Drees, Lukas; Roscher, Ribana; Wenzel, Susanne",pp. 279-286(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2018/00000084/00000005/art00015;jsessionid=tikv08egoq3e.x-ic-live-02,"The estimation of land cover fractions from remote sensing images is a frequently used indicator of the environmental quality. This paper focuses on the quantification of land cover fractions in an urban area of Berlin, Germany, using simulated hyperspectralEnMAPdata with a spatial resolution of 30 m × 30 m. We use constrained sparse representation, where each pixel with unknown surface characteristics is expressed by a weighted linear combination of elementary spectra with known land cover class. We automatically determine the elementary spectra from image reference data using archetypal analysis by simplex volume maximization, and combine it with reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo method. In our experiments, the estimation of the automatically derived elementary spectra is compared to the estimation obtained by a manually designed spectral library by means of reconstruction error, mean absolute error of the fraction estimates, sum of fractions, R2, and the number of used elementary spectra. The experiments show that a collection of archetypes can be an adequate and efficient alternative to the manually designed spectral library with respect to the mentioned criteria."
Classification of Aerial Photogrammetric 3D Point Clouds,"Becker, C.; Rosinskaya, E.; Häni, N.; D'Angelo, E.; Strecha, C.",pp. 287-295(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2018/00000084/00000005/art00016;jsessionid=tikv08egoq3e.x-ic-live-02,"We present a powerful method to extract per-point semantic class labels from aerial photogrammetry data. Labeling this kind of data is important for tasks such as environmental modeling, object classification, and scene understanding. Unlike previous point cloud classification methods that rely exclusively on geometric features, we show that incorporating color information yields a significant increase in accuracy in detecting semantic classes. We test our classification method on four real-world photogrammetry datasets that were generated with Pix4Dmapper, and with varying point densities. We show that off-the-shelf machine learning techniques coupled with our new features allow us to train highly accurate classifiers that generalize well to unseen data, processing point clouds containing 10 million points in less than three minutes on a desktop computer. We also demonstrate that our approach can be used to generate accurate Digital Terrain Models, outperforming approaches based on more simple heuristics such as Maximally Stable Extremal Regions."

Much of the stunning recent progress in 2D image interpretation can be attributed to the availability of large amounts of training data, which have enabled the (supervised) learning of deep neural networks. With the data set presented in this paper, we aim to boost the performance ofCNNsalso for 3D point cloud labeling. Our hope is that this will lead to a breakthrough of deep learning also for 3D (geo-) data. The semantic3D.net data set consists of dense point clouds acquired with static terrestrial laser scanners. It contains eight semantic classes and covers a wide range of urban outdoor scenes, including churches, streets, railroad tracks, squares, villages, soccer fields, and castles. We describe our labeling interface and show that, compared to those already available to the research community, our data set provides denser and more complete point clouds, with a much higher overall number of labeled points. We further provide descriptions of baseline methods and of the first independent submissions, which are indeed based onCNNs, and already show remarkable improvements over prior art. We hope that semantic3D.net will pave the way for deep learning in 3D point cloud analysis, and for 3D representation learning in general."

We propose a novel technique to identify disappearing and emerging PS points, which are regarded as building changes in cities. A spatiotemporal analysis is implemented as both spatial position and occurrence time are obtained for each change point. We first estimate each pixel's temporal coherences in different image subsets. Computed from temporal coherences, a change index sequence is introduced to quantify each pixel's probabilities of being change points at different times. All pixels' change indices are then utilized to extract change points by a global, automatic, and statistical-based scheme. We then eliminate blunders by a spatial filtering. Finally, the occurrence times of the change points are detected based on the temporal variation in their change index sequences. We implement a simulated data test to validate and assess our method. Using TerraSAR-X images, our real data test successfully recognizes steady, disappearing, and emerging buildings in Berlin, Germany within 2013."
Error-Regulated Multi-Pass DInSAR Analysis for Landslide Risk Assessment,"Kim, Jung Rack; Yun, HyeWon; Van Gasselt, Stephan; Choi, YunSoo",pp. 189-202(14),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2018/00000084/00000004/art00013;jsessionid=wk14t5mrcidt.x-ic-live-01,"Landslide risk assessment based on Differential InterferometricSARanalyses (DInSAR) is associated with a number of error effects. We here approach the problem of assessing landslide risks over mountainous areas, whereDInSARobservations are often influenced by orographic effects and inaccurate base topographies by employing a dedicated error compensation. In order to obtain accurate information on surface deformation, we apply corrections forDInSARinterferograms using high-resolution base topography and water vapor information obtained from a satellite radiometer. We observe that the correctedDInSARoutput is in accordance with the environmental context as inferred by geological and geomorphological settings. It is feasible to better quantify landslide monitoring schemes whenever high- accuracy atmospheric error maps and a methodology to effectively compensate for external errors inDInSARinterferograms are available. The approach in this study can be further upgraded for futureSAR-based assessments and various error correction approaches for even more precise landslide risk assessments."
Video Event Recognition and Anomaly Detection by Combining Gaussian Process and Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Models,"Yang, Michael Ying; Liao, Wentong; Cao, Yanpeng; Rosenhahn, Bodo",pp. 203-214(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2018/00000084/00000004/art00014;jsessionid=wk14t5mrcidt.x-ic-live-01,"In this paper, we present an unsupervised learning framework for analyzing activities and interactions in surveillance videos. In our framework, three levels of video events are connected by Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) model: low-level visual features, simple atomic activities, and multi-agent interactions. Atomic activities are represented as distribution of low-level features, while complicated interactions are represented as distribution of atomic activities. This learning process is unsupervised. Given a training video sequence, low-level visual features are extracted based on optic flow and then clustered into different atomic activities and video clips are clustered into different interactions. TheHDPmodel automatically decides the number of clusters, i.e., the categories of atomic activities and interactions. Based on the learned atomic activities and interactions, a training dataset is generated to train the Gaussian Process (GP) classifier. Then, the trainedGPmodels work in newly captured video to classify interactions and detect abnormal events in real time. Furthermore, the temporal dependencies between video events learned by HDP-Hidden Markov Models (HMM) are effectively integrated intoGPclassifier to enhance the accuracy of the classification in newly captured videos. Our framework couples the benefits of the generative model (HDP) with the discriminant model (GP). We provide detailed experiments showing that our framework enjoys favorable performance in video event classification in real-time in a crowded traffic scene."

Analyses of the coordinates of numerous control points stored in the Idaho and Montana Multi-State Control Point Database (MCPD) showed no statistical differences due to a point's stability and its physical setting. However, analyses comparing various realizations of horizontal datum revealed some significant differences. Specifically, there is >1 m difference observed between coordinates usingNAD83(1986) relative toNAD83(2011) and approximately 2 cm difference betweenNAD83(CORS96) andNAD83(2011) coordinates. A comparison of vertical coordinates derived from geoid models revealed a 30 cm mean difference betweenGEOID03 andGEOID12A, and >60 cm difference betweenGEOID99 andGEOID12A. The impact of velocity on these coordinates was apparent and varies strongly with local tectonics across the eastern Idaho study area. This study supports theNGSrecommendation to use the most current realization of horizontal and vertical datum available."
Integrated Image Matching and Segmentation for 3D Surface Reconstruction in Urban Areas,"Ye, Lei; Wu, Bo",pp. 135-148(14),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2018/00000084/00000003/art00009;jsessionid=w0elsa4ka0a1.x-ic-live-02,"High-resolution imagery, which features the advantages of high-quality imaging, a short revisit time, and lower costs, is an attractive option for 3D reconstruction applications. Photogrammetric 3D reconstruction requires reliable and dense image matching. In urban areas, however, image matching is particularly difficult because of the complexity of urban textures and the severe occlusion problems caused by buildings. This paper presents an integrated image matching and segmentation approach (namedSATM+) for 3D reconstruction in urban areas.SATM+ is based on our existing self-adaptive triangulation-constrained matching (SATM) framework and incorporates three novel aspects to address image matching challenges in urban areas: (1) image segmentation-based occlusion filtering, (2) segment-adaptive similarity measurement to reduce matching ambiguity, and (3) local and regional dense matching propagation to generate reliable and dense matches. We performed an experimental analysis of two sets of high-resolution urban images, and the 3D point clouds generated using the proposedSATM+ were compared with airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) data and the point clouds generated using the semi-global matching (SGM) method. The results indicate thatSATM+ can generate 3D point clouds with a geometric accuracy comparable to that of lidar data but a much higher point density.SATM+ performs similarly to SGM in relatively flat areas, but is superior in built-up areas. The proposed approach is a promising option for image-based 3D surface reconstruction in urban areas."

Control settings, exposure values, white balance, light metering,ISO, and lens aperture are evaluated for several bi-temporal imagery datasets. These variables are compared for their effects on dynamic range, intra-frame brightness variation, acuity, temporal consistency, and detectability of simulated cracks. Testing was conducted from a terrestrial, rather than airborne platform, due to the large number of images collected, and to minimize inter-image misregistration. Results point to exposure biases in the range of –0.7 or –0.3EV (i.e., slightly less than the auto-exposure selected levels) being preferable for change detection and noise minimization, by achieving a balance between full dynamic range and high acuity.DSLRcameras exhibit high radiometric fidelity and can effectively support low-cost aerial image-based change detection, such as for post-hazard damage assessment."

In order to evaluate the performance of different stereo matchers, several quality metrics have been developed based on quantifying error statistics with respect to a set of independent measurements usually referred to as ground truth data. However, such data are frequently not available, particularly in practical applications or planetary data processing. To address this, we propose a ground truth independent evaluation protocol based on manual measurements. A stereo visualization tool has been specifically developed to evaluate the quality of the computed correspondences. We compare the quality of disparity maps calculated from three stereo matching algorithms, developed based on a variation ofGOTCHA, which has been used in planetary robotic rover image reconstruction atUCL-MSSL(Otto and Chau, 1989). From our evaluation tests with the images pairs from Mars Exploration Rover (MER) Pancam and the field data collected in PRoViScout 2012, it has been found that all three processing pipelines used in our test (NASA-JPL,JR,UCL-MSSL) trade off matching accuracy and completeness differently.NASA-JPL's stereo pipeline produces the most accurate but less complete disparity map, whileJR's pipeline performs best in terms of the reconstruction completeness."

This study is the first to compare a variety of image processing methods of detecting and delineating cracks using bi-temporal, aerial images of complex scenes as input. Methods employing a bi-temporal, change detection approach outperform techniques relying on single-date imagery only.

Maps of developed land from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) of the conterminous United States include rural roads in the developed land class and therefore overestimate the amount of urban land. To better map the urban class and understand how urban lands change over time, we removed rural roads and small patches of rural development from theNLCDdeveloped class and created four wall-to-wall maps (1992, 2001, 2006, and 2011) of urban land. Removing rural roads from theNLCDdeveloped class involved a multi-step filtering process, data fusion using geospatial road and developed land data, and manual editing. Reference data classified as urban or not urban from a stratified random sample was used to assess the accuracy of the 2001 and 2006 urban andNLCDmaps. The newly created urban maps had higher overall accuracy (98.7 percent) than theNLCDmaps (96.2 percent). More importantly, the urban maps resulted in lower commission error of the urban class (23 percent versus 57 percent for theNLCDin 2006) with the trade-off of slightly inflated omission error (20 percent for the urban map, 16 percent forNLCDin 2006). The removal of approximately 230,000 km2of rural roads from theNLCDdeveloped class resulted in maps that better characterize the urban footprint. These urban maps are more suited to modeling applications and policy decisions that rely on quantitative and spatially explicit information regarding urban lands."

In this method, theINSprovides the dynamic information of the land vehicle, which is used to predict the position and attitude of cameras in order to obtain the predicted pixel coordinates of features on the image. The difference between the measured and predicted pixel coordinates is used to reduce the accumulated errors ofINS. To implement the proposed method, an Extended Kalman filter (EKF) is first used to integrate the inertial and visual sensor data. The integrated solution of position, velocity and azimuth is then applied by fuzzy logic map matching (MM) to project the vehicle location on the correct road link. The projected position on the road link and the road link azimuth can finally be used to reduce the dead reckoning drifts. In this way, the accumulated system errors can be significantly reduced. The testing results indicate that the horizontalRMSE(root-mean-square-error) of the proposed method is less than 20 meters over a traveled distance of five kilometers and the relative horizontal error is below 0.4 percent."
Rectified Feature Matching for Spherical Panoramic Images,"Chuang, T.Y.; Perng, N.H.",pp. 25-32(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2018/00000084/00000001/art00012;jsessionid=5feclhjyaydz.x-ic-live-03,"Spherical panoramic image processing has received renewed interest in the fields of photogrammetry and computer vision. The difficulty in spherical matching is largely due to inevitable image distortions introduced from the equirectangular projection. In this paper, we present an effective strategy for tackling the problem of distortion to improve the performance of spherical image matching. The effectiveness of the rectified matching is evaluated with simulated data and compared with state-of-art methods. In addition, experiments with respect to matching between omnidirectional and planar images, establishing 2D-to-3D correspondence with lidar, and the pose estimation of a spherical image sequence are conducted. The results verify the utility of the proposed method, which provides stable and evenly distributed corresponding points, and it is suitable for integration with conventional techniques for further 3D exploitation of imagery."
Detecting Glacier Surface Motion by Optical Flow,"Lenzano, M.G.; Lannutti, E.; Toth, C.; Rivera, A.; Lenzano, L.",pp. 33-42(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2018/00000084/00000001/art00013;jsessionid=5feclhjyaydz.x-ic-live-03,"In this study, we assessed the feasibility of using optical flow, in particular, large displacement optical flow (LDOF) method as a possible solution to obtain surface movement data to derive ice flow velocities in a glacier. Tests were carried out at the Viedma Glacier, located at the South Patagonia Icefield, Argentina, where terrestrial monoscopic image sequences were acquired by a calibrated camera from April 2014 until April 2016. As for preprocessing, the Correlated Analysis method was implemented to avoid and minimize errors due to the measurable changes in lighting, shadows, clouds, and snow. The results show a flow field with a maximum surface velocity value of 3.5 m/d. The errors were minimized by averaging the image sequence results based on seasons, in which the Total Error Reconstruction yielded fairly good mean accuracy (0.36 m/d). In summary, it was demonstrated thatLDOFcan provide accurate and robust solution to detect daily changes in the glacier surface."

There is an urgent need for rapid, accurate and cost-effective monitoring and assessment of soil salinization. Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are employed as viable technologies for detecting, monitoring, and predicting spatial-temporal patterns of soil salinization. The purpose of this study is to establish partial least squares regression (PLSR) models that are based on remotely sensed data and field measured electrical conductivity (ECa) and to retrieve soil salinity estimates by constructing an optimal model. First, the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) was calculated based on WorldView-2 images. Second, a statistical regression method was applied to analyze the correlation between ECa andSAVIunder different parameters. TheSAVIthat was measured as the most stable parameter was an optimum index. Finally, aPLSRprediction model of soil salinity was established based on the sensitivity bands, the optimum index and ECa. The results of this study are the following: (a) According to the adjusted parameter (L = 100), theSAVIindex illustrated the best correlation with ECa, and ECa was also significantly related to the bands ((Red Edge) Band6, (Near-IR1) Band7 and (Near-IR2) Band8) derived from a World-view-2 image. (b) The results of thePLSRpredictive model calibration showed that the model-D performed best through the sensitivity bands and optimal index, with the highest coefficient of determination (R2= 0.67) and the smallest root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.19 dS·m-1. The results indicated that the model-D that is constructed and applied in this paper could provide quantitative information for detecting and monitoring soil salinization in the Keriya Oasis and could also supply examples for the study of soil salinization in arid and semiarid regions with similar environmental conditions."
4FP-Structure: A Robust Local Region Feature Descriptor,"Li, Jiayuan; Hu, Qingwu; Ai, Mingyao",pp. 813-826(14),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2017/00000083/00000012/art00010;jsessionid=14vulb40kpov7.x-ic-live-02,"Establishing reliable correspondence for images of the same scene is still challenging work due to repetitive texture and unknown distortion. In this paper, we propose a region-matching method to simultaneously filter false matches and maximize good correspondence between images, even those with irregular distortion. First, a novel region descriptor, represented by a structure formed by four feature points (4FP-Structure), is presented to simplify matching with severe deformation. Furthermore, an expansion stage based on the special 4FP-Structure is adapted to detect and select as many high location accuracy correspondences as possible under a local affine-transformation constraint. Extensive experiments on both rigid and non-rigid image datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has a very high degree of correctness and significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods."
Modeling Indoor Spaces Using Decomposition and Reconstruction of Structural Elements,"Wang, Ruisheng; Xie, Lei; Chen, Dong",pp. 827-841(15),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2017/00000083/00000012/art00011;jsessionid=14vulb40kpov7.x-ic-live-02,"We present a framework for modeling architectural structure of indoor scene given unorganized 3D point clouds collected from an indoor mobile laser scanning system. The proposed pipeline employs a decomposition-and-reconstruction strategy to create the indoor structural elements on the floor plan. In contrast with existing methods, our method can deal with both inner and outer wall reconstruction through solving the optimization energy problem using graph cuts. In addition, our approach does not rely on timestamp informa- tion encoding line-of-sight information from each point to the laser scanner. It allows our algorithm to process most of the data sets. In particular, the proposed alpha-shape based door reconstruction and a hierarchical clustering technique is able to identify each room without prior information regarding the total number of rooms. Our experiments on real and synthetic point cloud scenes show that our ap- proach is robust and accurate for modeling indoor spaces."

Remotely sensed data can, in fact, provide a valuable source of broad scale information at each stage of the disaster management cycle, supporting scientists and authorities in the decision-making process. Geomatics-based procedures and techniques can be especially exploited in the emergency mapping domain for the extraction of reference (pre-event) and crisis (post-event) geographic data. The major challenges today concern the efficient selection (and integration) of the most fit-for-purpose mapping solution(s) and the development of automatic procedures to increase efficiency in data processing. This survey article provides a review of the current optical remote sensing sensors (both satellite and airborne) for rapid mapping applications. Advantages and disadvantages are evaluated in order to support the selection process of the most appropriate means to gather the required information (i. e., significant and value-added data). Since valuable information should be delivered in a very short time, the management of time is defined as a priority and several solutions are discussed to pursue efficiency in both data acquisition and processing. With this in mind, the most significant issues affecting time in each step of the work-flow and overall accuracy are analyzed and reported."

The U. S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis unit in the Pacific Northwest has been using 32 of these units to collect over 7,000 plot locations since 2013. In this study, one-hour GNSS static occupations were collected at 33 ground-surveyed positions with Trimble GeoXH6000 mapping-grade and Javad Triumph1 survey-grade receivers. Rover files were differentially post-processed and horizontal accuracy of each post-processed position was computed. Results indicated that 1.85 m accuracy (n = 990) could be achieved with the GeoXH6000 receiver with 15-minute occupations; however, maximum horizontal error was 7.01 m. Increasing occupation time to 20 minutes did not result in a significant improvement in accuracy. No correlation was found between the horizontal precision of a post-processed position reported by the postprocessing software and the field-measured horizontal accuracy of the positions."

However, there are challenges associated with the use of these data. The low spectral resolution limits spectral differentiation, while the high spatial resolution results in very large data sets for study areas even as small as a single county. Differences in acquisition dates and time of day result in varying illumination conditions and potentially even varying phenological state. As a consequence, image digital number (DN) values can vary between adjacent tiles, and shadow size and direction can be inconsistent between different tiles and different acquisitions. Therefore, taking full advantage of this valuable data source requires the analyst to be cognizant of such concerns and take measures to deal with such inconsistency and minimize its impact on the classification results; future research addressing these concerns would further enhance the value ofNAIPdata."
Double Projection Planes Method for Generating Enriched Disparity Maps from Multi-View Stereo Satellite Images,"Suliman, Alaeldin; Zhang, Yun",pp. 749-760(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2017/00000083/00000011/art00013;jsessionid=2dj441va54eda.x-ic-live-02,"The use of disparity information is computationally coste-ffective for 3D-assisted mapping applications. However, off-nadir satellite images over dense urban areas suffer from severe occlusion. Therefore, large gaps will be created due to the unsuccessful matching in the occluded areas. Commonly, gap interpolation produces misleading information that destroys the quality of the subsequent information extraction application. Hence, the more reliable solution is to fill the occlusion gaps by supplementary data. However, disparity maps are the co-relation of one stereo pair. Hence, supplementary disparity maps cannot be directly generated and applied. Thus, this paper introduces the Double Projection Plane (DPP) method for constructing disparity proportionality among multi-view stereo satellite images and calculating analytically the transferring scales required for producing supplementary disparity data. Accordingly, based on multi-view stereo satellite images, this method is promising to provide gap-and-outlier-free disparity maps that have the potential to replace the need for elevation models to some extent."

To rectify this correlation problem, this paper introduces a screw displacement based bundle block adjustment (SDA) model, in which an imaging ray's screw displacements described by dual quaternion are used to construct a collinearity equation. BySDA, the position and orientation elements are determined jointly. To evaluate the robustness and efficiency ofSDA, a group of progressive experiments were conducted on three types of datasets, including synthetic, close-range, and aerial images. Experimental results demonstrate thatSDAovercomes theEOPcorrelation problems and achieves reliable positioning accuracies for large-angle oblique photographic structures."
Motion Segmentation Using Global and Local Sparse Subspace Optimization,"Yang, Michael Ying; Ackermann, Hanno; Lin, Weiyao; Feng, Sitong; Rosenhahn, Bodo",pp. 769-778(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2017/00000083/00000011/art00015;jsessionid=2dj441va54eda.x-ic-live-02,"In this paper, we propose a new framework for segmenting feature-based moving objects under the affine subspace model. Since the feature trajectories are high-dimensional and contain the noise, we first apply the sparsePCAto represent the original trajectories with a low-dimensional global subspace, which consists of the orthogonal sparse principal vectors. Then, the local subspace separation is obtained using automatically searching the sparse representation of the nearest neighbors for each projected data. In order to refine the local subspace estimation and deal with the missing data problem, we propose an error estimation function to encourage the projected data that span a same local subspace to be clustered together. Finally, the segmentation of different motions is achieved through the spectral clustering on an affinity matrix, which is constructed with both the error estimation and the sparse neighbor optimization. We evaluate our proposed framework by comparing it to other motion segmentation algorithms. Our method achieves improved performance on state-of-the-art benchmark datasets."

Synthesizing historical and contemporary ecological data with ecosystem models can help researchers understand how species, communities, and landscapes are changing across space and time. Since these data are often stored in multiple collections and in various formats, data integration can be challenging. This paper presents a case study of the digitization of a large historical vegetation survey, i.e., the Wieslander Vegetation Type Mapping (VTM) project in California which highlights the importance of recovering and sharing such datasets. The protocol developed to digitize, georeference, visualize, and share these data is founded in geospatial concepts, and theVTMproject showcases the increasingly important role of geospatial experts in the fields of ecology, history, and other sciences. These methods are flexible, transferable and broadly applicable to other fields."
Bound-Constrained Multiple-Image Least-Squares Matching for Multiple-Resolution Images,"Hu, Han; Wu, Bo",pp. 667-677(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2017/00000083/00000010/art00008;jsessionid=hm6qh4tdumpw.x-ic-live-02,"Satellite images from multiple sources with different resolutions are currently able to observe the same region. Reliable image matching between these images is the first step in their integrated use. Image matching of multiple-resolution images is not trivial because of the large geometric differences among the images, which can cause failure of matching and losses of matching accuracy. This paper presents a bound-constrained, multiple-image, least-squares matching (LSM) method that extends the classicalLSMin two ways for better performance. First, the a priori metadata of the images, including the geo-referencing and scale information, are used for initial matching and to provide bound constraints in theLSMto improve its stability. Second, multiple images are matched in a single optimization rather than the traditional pairwise matching. This brings additional observations in the least-squares optimization, which makes the matching aware of both larger and local context and improves matching quality even with inaccurate initializations for high resolution images. Experimental analysis using multiple-source satellite images with multiple resolutions collected on Mars and in Hong Kong reveals that the proposed method is capable of obtaining reliable multiple-fold matches effectively, even in challenging cases with resolution differences as much as 20-fold. The method proposed in this paper has significance for the synergistic use of multiple-source satellite images in various applications."

We performed validation through aerial photointerpretation of agriculture at the field level, using cadastral parcels as proxies for fields, over Albemarle, Charles City, Chesterfield, and Henrico Counties forNLCD1992, 2001, 2006 andCDL2002, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011. The extent of agricultural land remained generally stable over 19 years but is generally overestimated by the datasets in all four counties, ranging from 70.06 percent to 697.48 percent of validation layer extent. Extent of agricultural land in our validation layer also differed from the Census of Agriculture, likely due to differing definition. Comparison of layer pairs on extent of agricultural land mostly reveals classification artifacts rather than change. The limited extent of agriculture and mixed land cover characteristics of the region suggest the use of multitemporal data to extract agricultural land cover."

Traditional methods for mismatch elimination tend to fail when the percentage of mismatches is high. In order to remove mismatches effectively, a new geometry-based approach is proposed in this paper, where Geometric Correspondence Feature (GCF) is used to represent the tentative correspondence. Based on the clustering property ofGCFsfrom correct matches, a new clustering algorithm is developed to identify the cluster formed by the correct matches.With the defined quality factor calculated from the identified cluster, a Progressive Sample Consensus (PROSAC) process integrated with hyperplane-model is employed to further eliminate mismatches.Extensive experiments based on both simulated and real images in indoor and outdoor environments have demonstrated that the proposed approach can significantly improve the performance of mismatch elimination in the presence of high-percentage mismatches."

In this paper, we achieve this goal by fusing the image information with information extracted from different modalities, including lidar andGIS. In contrast to other approaches, which require feature correspondences, our approach exploits edges across the modalities without the necessity to explicitly establish correspondences. In the proposed approach, extracted edges from different modalities are not required to have analytical forms. This flexibility is achieved by minimizing a new cost function using a Bayesian approach, which takes the Euclidean distances between the projected edges extracted from the other data source and the edges extracted from the reference image as its random variable. The proposed formulation minimizes the overall distances between the sets of edges iteratively, such that the end product results in the correct camera parameters for the reference image as well as matching features across the modalities. The initial solution can be obtained fromGPS/IMUdata. The formulation is shown to successfully handle noise and missing observations in edges. Point matching methods may fail for oblique images, especially high oblique images. We eliminate the requirement for exact point-to-point matching. The feasibility of the method is experimented with nadir and oblique images."

In order to solve two major problems simultaneously, we propose a new approach named stepwise-then-orthogonal regression (STOR) with quality control. First,RFMparameters are selected by stepwise regression with gross error detection.

Based on the Gauss-Markov model, geometric and radiometric correction coefficients are integrated and solved by an iterative method with variable weights in the proposed model. Moreover, many state-of-theart models and methods can be integrated into the proposed generalGRSCMframework.

The experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy of theGRSCMis significantly improved compared with that of geometric correction and radiometric correction separately."

Results indicated the heavily polluted regions and an alarming water quality deterioration trend between May 2006 and May 2014. A combination of land use/land cover (LULC) maps and socioeconomic data was considered to investigate the causative factors of the water quality distribution, as well as the deterioration.

In this research, we implemented random forests as a pattern classifier for land cover mapping from a satellite image covering a complex urban area, and evaluated the performance relative to several popular classifiers including Gaussian maximum likelihood (GML), multi-layer-perceptron networks (MLP), and support vector machines (SVM). Each classifier was carefully configured with the parameter settings recommended by recent literature, and identical training data were used in each classification. The accuracy of each classified map was further evaluated using identical reference data. Random forests were slightly more accurate thanSVMandMLPbut significantly better thanGMLin the overall map accuracy. Random forests and support vector machines generated almost identical overall map accuracy, but the former produced a smaller standard deviation of categorical accuracies, suggesting its better overall capability in classifying both homogeneous and heterogeneous land cover classes. Random forests have shown its robustness due to the most accurate classification on the whole, relatively balanced performance across all land cover categories, and relatively easier to implement. These findings should help promote the use of random forests for land cover classification in complex areas."

Recently, deep learning has been used to automatically learn suitable feature representations from a huge amount of data, without much expertise or effort in designing features. Motivated by its great success, this paper aims to use deep learning for detectingUVs. Because of the scarce labeled samples, this paper presents a novel unsupervised deep learning method to learn a data-driven feature. Experiments show the data-driven feature obtained with the proposed method outperform the existing unsupervised deep neural networks, and achieve results comparable to that obtained using the best hand-crafted features."
Economics of Mapping Using Small Manned and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"Thomas, Orrin H.; Smith, Charlie E.; Wilkinson, Benjamin E.",pp. 581-591(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2017/00000083/00000008/art00017;jsessionid=1n06a0ml46z7w.x-ic-live-01,"Specific professional bids to perform aerial data collection using large manned aerial vehicles (LMAV), small manned aerial vehicles (SMAV), and small unmanned aerial systems (UAS) were used to generate general bid models. From these bid models, it was determined what collection methods were competitive for particular jobs based on the project area, distance from the airport or office, and the modeled bids from competing methods. This approach is followed by a discussion of each platform's limitations and versatility. Results indicate thatUASandSMAVand can compete efficiently on aerial photogrammetric mapping up to at least 1,000 acres when the equipment gets enough usage. It is conjectured that this methodology will exert significant downward pressure on the cost of high-end sensors."
Improved Geometric Modeling of 1960s KH-5 ARGON Satellite Images for Regional Antarctica Applications,"Ye, Wenkai; Qiao, Gang; Kong, Fansi; Ma, Xuwen; Tong, Xiaohua; Li, Rongxing",pp. 477-491(15),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2017/00000083/00000007/art00010;jsessionid=9gder51511ql.x-ic-live-01,"Long-term observations of the Antarctic ice sheet will contribute to a quantitative evaluation and precise prediction of the sea level change induced by global changes in climate. This paper proposes an improved rigorous geometric modeling method for the declassifiedKH-5 ARGONsatellite images collected in Antarctica in 1960s. The scanned film images are preprocessed beforehand to enhance the quality for further analysis. Systematic errors such as lens distortion and atmospheric refraction are also considered and corrected. A scheme is proposed to measure the ground control points for the historical images based on modern image mosaic andDEMproducts. The bundle adjustment results of four blocks in regions in East Antarctica present a geometric positioning accuracy of less than one nominal pixel resolution (140 m) in both horizontal and vertical directions, outperforming the published results. A regionalDEMof the ice sheet that represents the topography in 1963 is then generated from the stereoARGONimages for the first time, the evaluation of which shows its consistency with the modern product but with great value for studying the recent change history of the ice sheet."

Based on the bias-compensated rational function model and the strip constraint model, a feasible extrapolated georeferencing approach forHRSimagery is presented. The presented approach remains effective even when the intermediate images in the strip are unavailable. Experimental results of the two ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) nadir datasets show that the direct georeferencing accuracy of theZY-3nadir images reaches only 9 to 12 pixels. With fourGCPsin the first image, the georeferencing accuracy of the other images in the strip is improved to better than 2 pixels through extrapolated georeferencing."

A red-green-blue (RGB) digital camera yielded approximately 72 percent classification accuracy for three commercial tree species and one conifer shrub. Accuracy improved approximately 15 percent, to 87 percent overall, with higher radiometric quality data acquired separately using a digital camera that included near infrared observations (at a lower spatial resolution). Interpretation of the point cloud, spectral, texture and object (tree crown) classification Variable Importance (VI) selected by a machine learning algorithm suggested a good correspondence with the traditional aerial photointerpretation cues used in the development of well-established large-scale photography northern conifer elimination keys, which use three-dimensional crown shape, spectral response (tone), texture derivatives to quantify branching characteristics, and crown size, development and outline features. These results suggest that commonly available consumer-gradeUAV-based digital cameras can be used with object-based image analysis to obtain acceptable conifer species classification accuracy to support operational forest inventory applications."

These lakes are important indicators of climate change, and changes in lake area have critical implications for water resources and ecological conditions. Lake area change can be monitored using the huge sets of high-resolution remote sensing data available, but this demands an automatic water classification system. This study develops an algorithm for automatic water classification using ChineseGF-1 (or Gaofen-1) wide-field-of-view (WFV) satellite data. The originalGF-1WFVdata were automatically preprocessed with radiometric correction and orthorectification. The single-band threshold and two global-local segmentation methods were employed to distinguish water from non-water features. Three methods of determining the optimal thresholds for normalized difference water index (NDWI) images were compared: Iterative Self Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA); global-local segmentation with thresholds specified by stepwise iteration; and the Otsu method. The water classification from two steps of global-local segmentations showed better performance than the single-band threshold andISODATAmethods. TheGF-1WFV-based lake mapping across the entire Tibetan Plateau in 2015 using the global-local segmentations with thresholds from the Otsu method showed high quality and efficiency in automatic water classification. This method can be extended to other satellite datasets, and makes the high-resolution global monitoring and mapping of lakes possible."
Aerodynamic Roughness Length Estimation with Lidar and Imaging Spectroscopy in a Shrub-Dominated Dryland,"Li, Aihua; Zhao, Wenguang; Mitchell, Jessica J.; Glenn, Nancy F.; Germino, Matthew J.; Sankey, Joel B.; Allen, Richard G.",pp. 415-427(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2017/00000083/00000006/art00012;jsessionid=831pi07hjwos.x-ic-live-03,"The aerodynamic roughness length (Z0m) serves an important role in the flux exchange between the land surface and atmosphere. In this study, airborne lidar (ALS), terrestrial lidar (TLS), and imaging spectroscopy data were integrated to develop and test two approaches to estimate Z0mover a shrub dominated dryland study area in south-central Idaho, USA. Sensitivity of the two parameterization methods to estimate Z0mwas analyzed. The comparison of eddy covariance-derived Z0mand remote sensing-derived Z0mshowed that the accuracy of the estimated Z0mheavily depends on the estimation model and the representation of shrub (e.g., Artemisia tridentata subsp. wyomingensis) height in the models. The geometrical method (RA1994) led to 9 percent (~0.5 cm) and 25% (~1.1 cm) errors at site 1 and site 2, respectively, which performed better than the height variability-based method (MR1994) with bias error of 20 percent and 48 percent at site 1 and site 2, respectively. The RA1994 model resulted in a larger range of Z0mthan the MR1994 method. We also found that the mean, median and 75th percentiles of heights (H75) fromALSprovides the best Z0mestimates in the MR1994 model, while the mean, median, andMLD(Median Absolute Deviation from Median Height), as well asAAD(Mean Absolute Deviation from Mean Height) heights fromALSprovides the best Z0mestimates in the RA1994 model. In addition, the fractional cover of shrub and grass, distinguished withALSand imaging spectroscopy data, provided the opportunity to estimate the frontal area index at the pixel-level to assess the influence of grass and shrub on Z0mestimates in the RA1994 method. Results indicate that grass had little effect on Z0min the RA1994 method. The Z0mestimations were tightly coupled with vegetation height and its local variance for the shrubs. Overall, the results demonstrate that the use of height and fractional cover from remote sensing data are promising for estimating Z0m, and thus refining land surface models at regional scales in semiarid shrublands."

When comparing the total impervious surface area, theNLCDoverestimated significant amounts (12 to 27 percent) for the entire town and across all specified land use zones (single family, multi-family, and non-residential) for both time periods examined. A binary pixel-wise accuracy assessment of impervious surface revealed that theNLCDperformed well for the multi-family and non-residential land use zones. However, accuracy level was quite low (user's accuracy <40 percent) for the single family land use zone. Percent impervious surface ofNLCDandDLCDwas further compared at 30 m and 90 m spatial scales. The spatial aggregation of pixels to 90 m led to improved agreement between the two datasets, althoughNLCDstill showed an underestimate of high values and an overestimate of low values. An empirical normalization equation was successfully applied to theNLCDto further reduce such data skewness."

Six modeling procedures, namely stepwise regression, partial least squares, recursive partitioning analysis, screening regression analysis, artificial neural networks, and combined models, were calibrated and validated for the basin and for the land cover types that exist in the basin. Although none of the developed models was powerful for predicting SOC, artificial neural networks models were more applicable specifically in agricultural lands. However, the margins of error associated with the best models were high, and hence hindered the applicability of these models in carbon crediting programs in semi-arid environments."

Lacking consensus, practitioners employ different criteria to define a height threshold, which is applied to all the metrics collectively. In this paper, we propose a change of paradigm in ALS metric computation: height thresholds must be optimized for each metric individually, instead of applying a single one for all them. We present an optimization method based on the maximal information coefficient (MIC), which is applied for each metric, one-by-one. Results showed how a bad choice of height thresholds damages the predictive potential of most metrics. While increasing thresholds strengthened height metrics' relationship to volume, it weakened for density metrics, and therefore choosing different thresholds makes sense."
A Simple But Effective Landslide Detection Method Based on Image Saliency,"Yu, Bo; Chen, Fang; Muhammad, Shakir; Li, Bin; Wang, Li; Wu, Mingquan",pp. 351-363(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2017/00000083/00000005/art00010;jsessionid=1ols2hettko4m.x-ic-live-03,"Effective large-scale landslide mapping is becoming significantly important for analyzing natural hazards and providing landslide locations rapidly for emergency response. Change detection and machine learning methods are commonly used for landslide detection. Change detection mostly relies on several experienced parameters that users have to tune for different images, which limits the practical application. The training machine learning model consumes much time, and it is limited to specific imaging conditions. In this paper, a simple method for landslide detection using a fixed parameter by calculating image saliency is proposed. Landslide is detected as a saliency object within the background of vegetation and bare rocks. It is fast and robust for the experimental images, and outperforms the state-of-the-art, semi-automatic method in terms of accuracy and computing time. Given the high efficiency and robustness of the proposed method, it is applicable to practical cases for hazard estimation."

We usedEO-1 Hyperion image of Pune City, India and assessed the suitability of different land covers as reflectance calibration surfaces. Furthermore, we performedLULCclassification using different reflectance calibration methods such as Internal Area Relative Reflectance, Flat Field Relative Reflectance, and 6S for comparative analysis. UrbanVISsignatures extracted from Hyperion image show distinct spectral curves at broader level. Flat Field Relative Reflectance method provides above 90 percent average overall accuracy. An advanced physics-based method such as 6S does not provide any added advantage over image-based calibration methods."

We present a Trimble eCognition® algorithm using four band optical aerial imagery and object-based classification to classify roads as paved or unpaved. The ruleset evaluates relationships between bands and allows separation and segmentation of unpaved roads from other pavement classes. The algorithm is applied to unincorporated areas of a six county region in Southeastern Michigan. Tree shadows on roads and the spectral similarity of road construction materials pose challenges to classification accuracy. An accuracy assessment of the classification indicated that the algorithm works well with overall classification accuracy between 82 and 94 percent."

In this paper, the potential of using visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) hyperspectral images fusion for classification of urban area is evaluated. For this purpose, comprehensive spatial-spectral feature space is generated which includes vegetation index, differential morphological profile (DMP), attribute profile (AP), texture, geostatistical features, structural feature set (SFS) and local statistical descriptors from both datasets in addition to original datasets. Although Support Vector Machine (SVM) is an appropriate tool in the classification of high dimensional feature space, its performance is significantly affected by its parameters and feature space. Cuckoo search (CS) optimization algorithm with mixed binary-continuous coding is proposed for feature selection andSVMparameter determination simultaneously. Moreover, the significance of each selected feature category in the classification of a specific object is verified. Accuracy assessment on two subsets shows that stacking ofVISandTIRbands can improve the classification performance to 87 percent and 82 percent for two subsets, compare toVISimage (72 percent and 80 percent) andTIRimage (50 percent and 56 percent). However, the optimum results obtained based on the proposed method which gains 94 percent and 92 percent. Furthermore, results show that usingTIRbesideVISimage improves classification accuracy of roads and buildings in urban area."

In the first step of this research, lidar point cloud is clustered into roof's major and minor planes. A FAST algorithm is used to extract roof corners from a 2D optical data. Afterwards, residue of the anomalies is obtained through subtraction of main planes' DSM from DSM of the lidar point cloud. Using a Canny operator, edges of the residue's anomalies image are extracted and then superimposed on the optical image to find appropriate corners. In the second step, shape descriptors related to all possible polygons formed by the corners are computed and compared against the ones, which are obtained from the extracted edges. Then, the polygon with the most similar shape descriptor would be chosen as the optimal polygon representing the roof structure of interest. In third step, planes are intersected and initial 3D roof model is reconstructed. It is added to 3D optimized roof model formed by 2D optimal polygon and minor planes which results in secondary 3D reconstructed roof model. Finally, a wire frame model is generated by vertexes. The results indicate efficiency of the residue of the anomalies and shape descriptors for buildings' roof modeling."

Multilayer NMF for Blind Unmixing of Hyperspectral Imagery with Additional Constraints,"Chen, Lei; Chen, Shengbo; Guo, Xulin",pp. 307-316(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2017/00000083/00000004/art00015;jsessionid=gneugf7xxoqm.x-ic-live-03,"Due to the coincidence of hyperspectral reflectance nonnegativity (and its corresponding abundance) with nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) methods,NMFhas been widely applied to unmix hyperspectral images in recent years. However, many local minima persist because of the nonconvexity of the objective function. Thus, the nonnegativity constraint is not sufficient and additional auxiliary constraints should be applied to objective functions. In this paper, a new approach we call constrained multilayerNMF(CMLNMF), is proposed for hyperspectral data. In this approach, the mixed spectra are regarded as endmember signatures that has been contaminated by multiplicative noise. The purpose ofCMLNMFis to eliminate noise by hierarchical processing until the endmember spectra are obtained. Also, the hierarchical processing is self-adaptive to make the algorithm more effective. Furthermore, in each layer two constraints are implemented on the objective function. One is sparseness on the abundance matrix and the other is minimum volume on the spectral matrix. The hierarchical processing separates the abundance matrix into a series of matrices that make the characteristic of sparseness more obvious and meaningful. The proposed algorithm is applied to synthetic data and real hyperspectral data for quantitative evaluation. According to the comparison with other algorithms,CMLNMFhas better performance and provides effective solutions for blind unmixing of hyperspectral image data."

The generated attributes are derived from the vegetation index and elevation information using morphological attribute profiles. The extended experimental evaluation and comparison of attribute profile-based mapping solutions is conducted to derive the optimal combinations of attributes required for classification and to understand the genericity of attributes on a range of classifiers, i.e., various combinations of attributes and classifiers. Experimental results with two high resolution images show that the proposed attributes derived on auxiliary information outperform the existing attribute profiles computed on original image and its principal components."

In addition, the traditional morphological-based spatial-spectral classification methods require the design of handcrafted features according to experience, which is far from automatic and lacks generalization ability. To automatically represent the spatial-spectral features around the central pixel within a spatial neighborhood window, a novel spatial-spectral feature classification method based on the unsupervised convolutional sparse auto-encoder (UCSAE) with a window-in-window strategy is proposed in this study. TheUCSAEalgorithm features a unique spatial-spectral feature extraction approach which is executed in two stages. The first stage represents the spatial-spectral features within a spatial neighborhood window on the basis of spatial-spectral feature extraction of sub-windows with a sparse auto-encoder (SAE). The second stage exploits the spatial-spectral feature representation with a convolution mechanism for the larger outer windows. TheUCSAEalgorithm was validated by two widely used hyperspectral imagery datasets (the Pavia University dataset and the Washington DC Mall dataset) obtaining accuracies of 90.03 percent and 96.88 percent, respectively, which are better results than those obtained by the traditional hyperspectral spatial-spectral classification approaches."

This paper presents a method for automatic extraction of road networks from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. The method consists of three steps. During the first step, road area candidates are detected based on the fusion of extracted features: minimum radiance, contrast, and direction of minimum radiance. In the second step, several refinement criteria are used in order to discard detected false candidates, and a thinning morphology operator is applied on the road areas to extract the road segments. Seed points of interest are then extracted to using in a network snake model, which is employed in the third step to connect the seed points in order to form the road network. Minimizing the energy function of the Snake model and then using a perceptual grouping algorithm is for discarding redundant segments and avoiding gaps between segments is used sequentially in the network snake model. The proposed algorithm is tested on TerraSAR-X images with different areas. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method is effective in terms of correctness, completeness, and quality. An accuracy assessment showed that the proposed model is capable of achieving a quality index between 56 to 82.5 percent."

The proposed method is implemented as follows: (a) a hierarchical segmentation is constructed to dynamically retain point clouds on the road surface; (b) the point clouds are divided into dynamically segmented blocks using trajectory points, and plane estimation is investigated to continuously estimate road slopes and superelevations; and (c) the estimated slopes and superelevations are iterated and filtered to decrease the influence of outliers. The proposed method was tested and validated for inclining and winding road types. The estimated slopes and superelevations satisfied real road conditions."
Unsupervised Object-Based Differencing for Land-Cover Change Detection,"Zhu, Jinxia; Su, Yanjun; Guo, Qinghua; Harmon, Thomas C.",pp. 225-236(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2017/00000083/00000003/art00020;jsessionid=2it8u4t2au2gx.x-ic-live-03,"One main problem of the spectral decomposition-based change detection method is the lack of efficient automatic techniques for developing the difference image. Traditional techniques generally assume that gray-level values in a difference image are independent and multitemporal images are co-registered/rectified perfectly without error. However, such assumptions are often violated because of the inevitable image misregistration and the interference of correlations between spectral bands. This study proposes an automated method based on the object-based multivariate alteration detection/maximum autocorrelation factor approach and the Gaussian mixture model-expectation maximization algorithm to obtain unsupervised difference images. This procedure is applied to bi-temporal (2005 and 2006)SPOT-HRVimages at Panyu District Ponds, China. Results show that the proposed method successfully excludes the correlations of spectral bands and the influence of misregistration, as evidenced by a higher accuracy (up to 93.6 percent). These unique technical characteristics make this analytical framework suitable for detecting changes."

In comparison to shorelines interpreted from 0.3 m and 1 m orthophotography, the automatedGIS10 m alongshore sampling foundSARshoreline mapping accuracy to be ±2 m, well within the lower range of reported shoreline mapping accuracies. The high comparability was obtained even though water levels differed between theSARand photography image pairs and included all shorelines regardless of complexity.

Shadow Identification in High Resolution Satellite Images in the Presence of Water Regions,"Mostafa, Y.; Abdelhafiz, A.",pp. 87-94(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2017/00000083/00000002/art00010;jsessionid=6vzun0pgik7m.x-ic-live-02,"Shadow is a main obstacle in features extraction from high resolution satellite images. Water areas provide low reflectance; therefore, they are commonly classified as shadow. In traditional shadow identification procedures, shadow is identified from image histogram in which, water and shadow pixels are mixed. In this study, a new image index is presented. The index histogram separates non-shadow, shadow, and water pixels using a proposed threshold method. The developed index is then integrated into a complete approach for shadow identification. Five study areas including water, shadow on water, and shallow water regions are tested using the developed approach. Afterward, an accuracy assessment is made to demonstrate the approach efficiency. The experimental results show that the proposed approach achieved overall accuracy about ninety-three percent. The rate of detecting shadow on water is about seventy-four percent. On the other hand, shallow water is still misclassified as shadow."

Macro-textures are related to the information defined by the whole image scene, while micro-textures describe distributions and relationships of the gray levels within a local window. Moreover, we propose two strategies, random forests (RF) and a fuzzy set model, to integrate different characteristics of the textures. Experiments were conducted onZY-3(the first civilian high-resolution stereo mapping satellite of China) orthographic images of the cities of Wuhan and Tokyo, as well as WorldView-2 multi-spectral images of the city of Kuala Lumpur. Results showed that the wavelet-based features obtained the highest accuracy among the macro-textures, while the morphological attributes obtained the best results for the micro-textures. By integrating both micro- and macro-textures, the texture combination using both RF and a fuzzy set model can further improve the accuracy of change detection."

In this study, aerial color (RGB) imagery, along with co-registered airborne discrete lidar data were used to separate vegetation and buildings from other urban classes/cover-types, as a precursory step towards the assessment of urban forest biomass. Both spectral and structural features such as object height, distribution of surface normals from the lidar, and a novel vegetation metric derived from combined lidar andRGBimagery, referred to as the lidar-infused vegetation index (LDVI) were used in this classification method. The proposed algorithm was tested on different cityscape regions to verify its robustness. Results showed a good separation of buildings and vegetation from other urban classes with on average an overall classification accuracy of 92 percent, with a kappa statistic of 0.85. These results bode well for the operational fusion of lidar andRGBimagery, often flown on the same platform, towards improved characterization of the urban forest and built environments."
Automatic 3D Surface Co-Registration Using Keypoint Matching,"Persad, Ravi Ancil; Armenakis, Costas",pp. 137-151(15),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2017/00000083/00000002/art00015;jsessionid=6vzun0pgik7m.x-ic-live-02,"A framework for co-registering multi-temporal3Dpoint cloud surfaces (PCSs) is presented, which addresses the co-registration of urban and non-urban3Dsurfaces formed by3Dpoints. These surfaces are acquired from different surface measurement sensors and are in different coordinate systems. No prior information about initial transformation parameters or proximate matching is assumed. A keypoint matching approach is proposed to co-register twoPCSs. First, surface curvature information is utilized for scale-invariant keypoint extraction. Then, every keypoint is characterized by a scale, rotation, and translation invariant surface descriptor called the radial geodesic distance-slope histogram. Keypoints with similar surface descriptors on the twoPCSsare matched using bipartite graph matching. Given scale, rotation and translation changes between PCS pairs, co-registration tests on multi-sensor urban and non-urban datasets gave rotation errors from 0.017° to 0.023°, translation errors from 0.007 m to 0.013 m and scale factor errors from 0.0002 to 0.0014."

The relative exterior orientations were transformed from the camera frame to the navigation frame before they were used as external update information of the Kalman Filter. Combining all the relative orientation information retrieved from images, the Kalman Filter can give an improved output for the exterior orientation parameters. Airborne result from the tests of one straight strip shows that the heading accuracy of aGNSS/MEMS-IMUwas improved from 0.26° to 0.10°, and the result from one closed strip shows that heading accuracy was improved from 1.11° to 0.85° and roll accuracy from 0.54° to 0.43°."

However, the methods used in fire risk prediction are mostly based on field-based meteorological data, and the coefficients are hard-defined, heavily depending on user experience. We propose to use a user-friendly machine learning method, Random Forest™, to train a regression model by synthesizing publicly available remote sensed products to predict fire risk ratings at pixel-level in eight-day advance. The structure of our model synthesizes features in three-time intervals T1, T2, and T3 to predict fire occurrence probability in T4. The experiment demonstrates the efficiency of such model in predicting fire occurrence with a correlation coefficient of 0.987 and mean square error being 0.00285. It results in a practical way to predict fire risk and prevent fires."

This is a significant improvement over the accuracy that was obtained using the Radarsat-2 (80 percent) or Landsat-8 sensor data alone (84 percent). Variable importance (VI) was measured for geomorphometric measures related to the gravity-, wind- and solar-fields, which were developed to explain eco-hydrological differences and increase the separability of wetland classes. Further research will consider additional geomorphometric and spectral response variables that are useful in more detailed boreal wetland classifications and analysis of wetland characteristics over time."

These methods need to construct a similarity graph with k-nearest neighbors or ∈-radius ball. However, the neighborhood size is difficult to select in real-world applications. To solve the problem, we propose a new unsupervisedFEmethod, called sparsity preserving analysis (SPA), based on sparse representation and graph embedding. The proposed algorithm utilizes sparse representation to obtain the sparse coefficients of data. Then, it constructs a new graph with the sparse coefficients that reveals the sparse properties of data. Finally, the structure of the graph is preserved in low-dimensional space to obtain a transformation matrix forFE. In addition, a new classification method, termed sparse neighborhood classifier (SNC), is designed using the sparse representation-based methodology. It uses the sparse coefficients of a new sample to obtain the similarity weights in each class. Then, the label information of the new sample is obtained by the weights. The classification accuracies ofSPAwithSNCreach to 86.9 percent and 80.6 percent on PaviaU and UrbanHSIdata sets, respectively. The results demonstrate thatSPAwithSNCcan effectively extract low-dimensional features and improve the discriminating power forHSIclassification."

In this paper, we propose a new formulation of exterior orientation that is robust against gross errors (outliers). Different from classic optimization methods whose cost function is based on thelq-norm of residuals, we uselq-norm (0<q<1) instead. We reformulate the new cost function as an augmented Lagrangian function because it is not strictly convex. In addition, we employ the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to decompose the augmented Lagrangian function into three simple sub-problems and solve them iteratively. Our work recovers the orientation and position of a camera from outliers contaminating observations without any gross error detection stage such as random sample consensus (RANSAC). Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and can easily handle situations with up to 85 percent outliers. The source code of the proposed algorithm is made public."

During the 38 year analysis period there was a 4,500 percent increase inCPIsystems detected that corresponded to an approximate 2,000 percent increase in total acreage. The bulk of the total acreage irrigated is contained in southwest Georgia, as seven counties in the region contained 38 percent of the total acreage irrigated in 2013. There was substantial growth throughout the entire Coastal Plain Region, but southwest Georgia was identified as the most heavily irrigated region of the state."

While standard direct georeferencing solves this task in open areas, poorGNSScoverage in densely built-up areas and urban canyons frequently prevents sufficient accuracy and reliability. Thus, we use bundle block adjustment, which additionally integrates tie and control point information for precise georeferencing of our multi-camera mobile mapping system. Subsequently, this allows the adaption of a state-of-the-art dense image matching pipeline to provide a suitable 3Drepresentation of the captured urban structures. In addition to the presentation of different processing steps, this paper also provides an evaluation of the achieved image-based 3Dcapture in a dense urban environment."

A compactCRPsystem equipped with multiple cameras and aGPSreceiver is one of those advanced portable mapping systems. A portable panoramic image mapping system (PPIMS) was specially designed to capture panoramic images with eight cameras and to obtain the position of image station with aGPSreceiver. A PPIMS can be considered as a panoramicCRPsystem. The coordinates of an object point can be determined by the intersection of panoramic image points. For the implementation, we propose a new concept of photogrammetry by using panoramic images. Eight images captured byPPIMSforms a spherical panorama image (SPI). Instead of using the original images, PPIMSSPIsare then used for photogrammetric triangulation and mapping. Under this circumstance, oneSPIis formed for each station, and it is associated with only one set of exterior orientation (EO) parameters. Traditional collinearity equations are not applicable toSPItriangulation and mapping. Therefore, a novel bundle adjustment algorithm is proposed to solveEOof multi-stationSPIs. BecausePPIMSSPIsare not idealSPIs, a correction scheme was also developed to correct the imperfect geometry ofPPIMS SPI. Two test studies were performed for the data collected at a campus test field of National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) and at a historical site of Tainan. Both cases demonstrate the feasibility ofSPIbundle adjustment and applying corrections forPPIMSSPIsnecessary for effective for bundle adjustment. Furthermore, the experiment's results also confirm thatSPIscan replace original images forPPIMStriangulation."
Rigorous Strip Adjustment of UAV-based Laserscanning Data Including Time-Dependent Correction of Trajectory Errors,"Glira, Philipp; Pfeifer, Norbert; Mandlburger, Gottfried",pp. 945-954(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2016/00000082/00000012/art00016;jsessionid=6f5g9732ljapu.x-ic-live-02,"A new generation of laser scanners mounted on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have the potential to provide high-quality point clouds of comparatively small areas (a few hectares). The high maneuverability of theUAVs, a typically large field of view of the laser scanners, and a comparatively small measurement range lead to point clouds with very high point density, less occlusions, and low measurement noise. However, due to the limited payload ofUAVs, lightweight navigation sensors with a moderate level of accuracy are used to estimate the platform's trajectory. As a consequence, the georeferencing quality of the point clouds is usually sub-optimal; for this, strip adjustment can be performed. The main goal of strip adjustment is to simultaneously optimize the relative and absolute orientation of the strip-wise collected point clouds. This is done by fully re-calibrating the laser scanning system and by correcting systematic measurement errors of the trajectory. In this paper, we extend our previous work on the topic of strip adjustment by the estimation of time-dependent trajectory errors. The errors are thereby modelled by natural cubic splines with constant segment length in time domain. First results confirm the suitability of this flexible correction model by reducing the relative and absolute strip discrepancies to 1.38 cm and 1.65 cm, respectively."

Pedestrians and cyclists are obtained from a sequence of point clouds by segmentation and classification. Their locations are then accumulated in a grid map, which serves as a ""heat map"" for possible hazardous situations.

In order to tackle the challenge of distinguishing geometrically similar classes and enhancing the separability of other targets, a new set of features based on deconvolved waveforms is introduced. The positive effect of the proposed feature dataset on classification accuracy in individual classes is shown using two ensemble classifiers (random forests and RUSBoost). Performance of the classifiers is improved by integration with sampling techniques, especially for the under-represented classes. The final output of the proposed method is a highly detailed land cover map of the urban scene, which affords good separability between critical classes."

Richness was the strongest model (RMSE= 2.47 species, Adj. R2= 0.60), followed by aspen stem diameter, basal area (BA), height, density, and percent cover (Adj. R2range = 0.22 to 0.53). Effects of pre-fire aspenBAand fire severity on post-fire aspen structure and richness were analyzed. Post-fire recovery attributes were not significantly related to fire severity, while all but percent cover and richness were sensitive to pre-fire aspenBA(Adj. R2range = 0.12 to 0.33, p <0.001).

A coarse-to-fine registration algorithm based on phase information is proposed. The coarse registration is implemented using Fourier-polar transform and phase correction based on phase congruency. The fine registration is first implemented by dividing large images into blocks. Then, the uniformly distributed corners and Principal Phase Congruency (PPC) images are extracted. After that, the corresponding points of extracted corners are obtained based on Phase Correlation of Principal Phase Congruency (PCPPC), followed by a new outlier removal method. Experiment results revealed the robustness, accuracy, and distribution quality less than 1.0 of the proposed algorithm. The matching correct rate is about 94.7 percent for Data Set 2 due to considerable topography variations, and more than 96.6 percent for data set 4 despite significant different or inverse intensity, which can reach 100 percent with our outlier removal method."

Assuming the availability of prior information regarding theUAVtrajectory, this paper presents two approaches for reliable estimation of Relative Orientation Parameters (ROPs) in the presence of high percentage of matching outliers. The first approach, which assumes that theUAVplatform is moving at a constant flying height while maintaining the camera in a nadir-looking orientation, provides a two-point closed-form solution. The second approach starts from prior information regarding the flight trajectory to define a linearized model, which is augmented with a built-in outlier removal procedure, to estimate a refined set ofROPs. Experimental results from real datasets demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approaches in providing reliableROPsfromUAV-based imagery in the presence of a high percentage of matching outliers (up to 90 percent)."
Geometric Calibration of Ziyuan-3 Three-Line Cameras Using Ground Control Lines,"Cao, Jinshan; Yuan, Xiuxiao; Fang, Yi; Gong, Jianya",pp. 893-902(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2016/00000082/00000011/art00018;jsessionid=be0mb0mqba5d.x-ic-live-02,"Owing to the large biases of laboratory-calibrated imaging parameters, the initial direct georeferencing accuracy of Ziyuan-3 (ZY-3) three-line camera (TLC) images can only reach the kilometer level. In this paper, a line-based geometric calibration model is established by using the line-coplanarity constraint, and a feasible geometric calibration approach for theZY-3 TLCs using ground control lines (GCLs) is presented. Experimental results show that the calibration accuracy achieved by usingGCLsreached about 1.0 pixel, which was almost the same as that achieved by using ground control points (GCPs). After substitutingGCLsforGCPsin the geometric calibration, the georeferencing accuracy of theZY-3 TLCimages without ground controls was significantly improved from the kilometer level to better than 11 m in planimetry and 8 m in height. A better georeferencing accuracy of about 3.0 m in planimetry and 2.5 m in height was achieved after the block adjustment with fourGCPs."
The Influence of Elliptical Gaussian Laser Beam on Inversion of Terrain Information for Satellite Laser Altimeter,"Hui, Zhou; Song, Li; Chi, Yang",pp. 767-773(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2016/00000082/00000010/art00012;jsessionid=bq1p78dogsf1.x-ic-live-03,"The transmitted laser mode of Geosciences Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) is a significant factor in determining the received pulse waveforms, which are used for inversing target information. The inversion algorithms in the scientific literature are based on the assumption that the transmitted laser is circular Gaussian. The practical laser pattern ofGLASis not circularly symmetric, but elliptical Gaussian. The received pulse shape will contain a bias, which would cause an error in the inversion information. In this paper, we describe new theoretical models about received pulse signal and inversion errors of range, surface slope and roughness. We present the results of waveforms shape and inversion errors for three representative terrains with different surface slope and roughness. The results show that the maximal inversion errors of range, surface slope, and roughness will reach 24.25 cm, 8.82° and 4.58 m, respectively, which cannot be negligible. Therefore, the inversion information should be reevaluated and amended depending on the type of terrain."
Evaluation of Geometric Elements of Repeat Station Imaging and Registration,"Stow, Douglas A.; Coulter, Lloyd C.; Lippitt, Christopher D.; MacDonald, Garrick; McCreight, Richard; Zamora, Nicholas",pp. 775-789(15),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2016/00000082/00000010/art00014;jsessionid=bq1p78dogsf1.x-ic-live-03,"Repeat station imaging (RSI) is an approach to precise aerial image registration and change detection. It involves planning and conducting aerial imaging flights such that the same sensor returns to the same imaging stations over time, replicating view geometry, and the resultant images are geometrically processed on a frame-by-frame basis. The objective of this paper is to elucidate and model the geometric elements associated with RSI capture and processing that influence the accuracy of co-registration. When each type of offset or difference in orientation is modeled separately, relative displacement of features in RSI pairs are linear functions of the varying orientation parameters and focal length, with the exception of an inverse square relationship with altitude above ground level; the combination of higher altitude and longer focal length reduces image displacements approximately in half. The average difference (bias) between modeled and measured parallax in ground dimensions is 0.1 m. Isolating the effects of orientation and offset factors is a useful first step towards developing a robust analytical model of the geometry of RSI pairs."
Modeling the Effects of Horizontal Positional Error on Classification Accuracy Statistics,"Glick, Henry B.; Routh, Devin; Bettigole, Charlie; Seegmiller, Lindsi; Kuhn, Catherine; Oliver, Chadwick D.",pp. 789-802(14),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2016/00000082/00000010/art00016;jsessionid=bq1p78dogsf1.x-ic-live-03,"Using a concept proposed by Stehman and Czaplewski (1997), we implemented spatially-explicit Monte Carlo simulations to test the effects of manually introduced horizontal positional error on standard inter-rater statistics derived from twelve classified high-resolution images. Through simulations we found that both overall and kappa accuracies decrease markedly with increasing error distance, varying greatly across distances relevant to practical application. The use of ground reference sites falling solely in homogeneous patches significantly improves inter-rater statistics and calls into question the use of kernel-smoothed data in one-time accuracy assessments. Our simulations offer insight into the scale of both structural and cover type heterogeneity across our landscapes, and support a new method for minimizing the effects of positional error on map accuracy. We recommend that analysts use caution when applying traditional accuracy assessment strategies to categorical maps, particularly when working with high-resolution imagery."

This algorithm retrieves surface soil moisture, land surface temperature, and canopy temperature simultaneously using brightness temperature data in bare soil, low to moderate and higher amounts of vegetation cover.Furthermore, a new index calledMSVI(Multi Sensor Vegetation Index) has been introduced to approximate vegetation effects on properly observed brightness temperatures. The algorithm includes model construction, calibration, and validation using observations carried out for theSMEX03(Soil Moisture Experiment 2003) region in the South and North of Oklahoma. The results indicated about 0.9 percent improvement on soil moisture estimation accuracy using theMSVI."

The lack of analytical functionality nonetheless restricts their utility in research, including archaeology. Integrating both 3D and analytical functionalities should result in a 4D archaeological GIS that can be used throughout the archaeological workflow. This paper investigates the feasibility of extending a virtual globe to such a user-friendly system. This involves a technical assessment by comparing the characteristics of virtual globes with user, data, functional, and organizational requirements. The prototypical implementation consequently uses Cesium® as basis. This prototype served for the practical feasibility evaluation. The usability test with two Flemish archaeological organizations has shown broad support for a low-threshold 4D ArcheoGIS from its potential end-users. Although public activities, analyses, and fieldwork preparations were mentioned as application domains, extending the system to fit archaeological workflows or a cyberinfrastructure is necessary."

The data can be used with the previously published Land Cover Trends Dataset: 1973 to 2000 to assess landuse/land-cover change across a 37-year study period. Results from analysis of these data include ecoregion-based statistical estimates of the amount ofLULCchange per time period, ranking of the most common types of conversions, rates of change, and percent composition. Overall estimated amount of change per ecoregion from 2001 to 2011 ranged from a low of 370 km2in the Northern Basin and Range Ecoregion to a high of 78,782 km2in the Southeastern Plains Ecoregion. The Southeastern Plains continues to encompass one of the most intense forest harvesting and regrowth regions in the country, with 16.6 percent of the ecoregion changing between 2001 and 2011. TheseLULCchange statistics provide a new, valuable resource that complements other reference data and field-verifiedLULCdata. Researchers can use this resource to independently validate other land change products or to conduct regional land change assessments."
An Individual Tree-Based Automated Registration of Aerial Images to LiDAR Data in a Forested Area,"Lee, Jun-Hak; Biging, Gregory S.; Fisher, Joshua B.",pp. 699-710(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2016/00000082/00000009/art00017;jsessionid=b3e9n8o91qim.x-ic-live-03,"In this paper, we demonstrate an approach to align aerial images to airborne lidar data by using common object features (tree tops) from both data sets under the condition that conventional correlation-based approaches are challenging due to the fact that the spatial pattern of pixel gray-scale values in aerial images hardly exist in lidar data. We extracted tree tops by using an image processing technique called extended-maxima transformation from both aerial images and lidar data. Our approach was tested at the Angelo Coast Range Reserve on the South Fork Eel River forests in Mendocino County, California. Although the aerial images were acquired simultaneously with the lidar data, the images had only approximate exposure point locations and average flight elevation information, which mimicked the condition of limited information availability about the aerial images. Our results showed that this approach enabled us to align aerial images to airborne lidar data at the single-tree level with reasonable accuracy. With a local transformation model (piecewise linear model), theRMSEand the median absolute deviation (MAD) of the registration were 9.2 pixels (2.3 meters) and 6.8 pixels (1.41 meters), respectively. We expect our approach to be applicable to fine scale change detection for forest ecosystems and may serve to extract detailed forest biophysical parameters."

Three customized tiers of sampling strata were created, as discussed, to meet these goals. Stratified random sampling was employed in each stratum with a six out of nine pixel-homogeneity criteria (different from the final minimum mapping unit) required for each sampling unit. Accuracy was assessed for nine regions in the coastal United States with overall accuracy ranging from 82.3 percent to 85.6 percent. Binary change was mapped with 88.7 percent accuracy, with the largest error being errors of commission (71.2 percent user accuracy). This sampling design also allowed for the identification of 137 locations where true change was not mapped, allowing for statements to be made about missed change."

PopularSARchange detectors include ratio and logarithmic-ratio (log-ratio) operators, and those based on a statistical similarity between temporal images. The ratio and log-ratio operators are not ideal for polarimetricSAR(POLSAR) images, as only the intensity or amplitude information is used. Change detectors based on similarity comparison of probability distribution functions are difficult to implement and not reliable because of the uncertainties in estimating distribution parameters. Our research aims to find a reliable and computationally simple change detector from among three typical polarimetric distance measures. The change detection potential and abilities of these distance measures are analyzed from a mathematical point of view, and then compared through a test dataset composed of twoRADARSAT-2fine-quad polarized images. The symmetric revised Wishart (SRW) distance, originally developed for image segmentation, is found to be an effective change detector. Based on the test data, the change map derived from theSRWdistance achieves 93.24 percent change rate and 5.67 percent false alarm rate. Furthermore, the eigendecompostion of theSRWdistance is given for the first time, which uncovers the linkage of theSRWdistance with the scattering mechanisms and the corresponding amplitudes embedded in two polarimetric covariance matrices, forming a theoretical explanation for the superiority of theSRWdistance as a change detector. Our research indicates the general applicability of theSRWdistance forPOLSARchange detection."

TheMMFIenhances the local brightness contrast of rare earth mining areas (REMAS) by highlighting the morphological characteristics ofREMAstructure, and improves the identification of roads and bare soil, which have similar spectral signatures toREMAS. Moreover, a new threshold optimization method that maximizes the histogram entropy is presented, wherebyREMAScan be automatically extracted from theMMFIimage without sample collection and machine learning. Therefore, it is a fully automatic method suitable forREMAextraction over large areas. To validate the proposed method, three temporal Landsat images acquired of Changting County, China, were used to extractREMAinformation. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve good classification accuracy compared with other methods."

Basal Area and Diameter Distribution Estimation Using Stereoscopic Hemispherical Images,"Sánchez-González, Mariola; Cabrera, Miguel; Herrera, Pedro Javier; Vallejo, Roberto; Cañellas, Isabel; Montes, Fernando",pp. 605-616(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2016/00000082/00000008/art00010;jsessionid=6n9h27cm3pipf.x-ic-live-01,"In recent years, proximal sensing data has increasingly been used to optimize forest inventories. In this paper we present a forest inventory methodology based on stereoscopic hemispherical images. An automated pixel-based approach and a user-guided “region growing” approach have been developed for image matching. To estimate the basal area, number of trees and mean diameter, the sampling probability is determined for each tree. The accuracy and precision of the estimates derived from stereoscopic hemispherical images was analyzed for a set of National Forest Inventory plots. The results revealed that tree matching depends on the species, the distance to the target tree and the diameter. The Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.86 for the mean diameter and 0.89 for the basal area, whereas for the number of trees per hectare it was 0.59. The proposed methods may be used in large scale forest inventories as a cost-efficient way of obtaining data on diameter distribution and basal area from field surveys following a two-stage scheme combined with remote sensing techniques."

First, through careful observation of the stereo geometry that determines the ray-intersection in object space, the effects of the angles were visualized and quantified. Second, formulas to estimate the positioning errors, including these quantified effects, were proposed. Third, the formulas were validated using real satellite data. Our experiment results confirmed the accuracy variations due to the angles, both visually and quantitatively, and that all angles may significantly affect both the horizontal and vertical accuracies, particularly for dual-satellite stereo with weak geometry. The primary contributions of this paper are the provision of theoretical background of the effects of the angles and experimental confirmations of the quantitative effects of them on the stereo positioning accuracies."

Currently, scale parameter selection is often dependent on subjective trial-and-error methods or post-evaluation of multi-segmentation, which directly reduces efficiency of cropland extraction. This paper proposes a cropland extraction method combining spatial statistics based adaptive scale parameter pre-estimation and object-oriented classification. SPOT5 multi-spectral image in Baishan is used as experimental data to verify the validity of the methodology. Experimental results show that the pre-estimated scale parameter can yield a classification result with both high classification accuracy and completeness for extracting cropland information. This presented method avoids the time-consuming trial-and-error practice by accelerating the object-oriented classification procedure. Hierarchical rule set based classifications achieve higher accuracies and lower fragmentation than nearest neighbor-supervised classification. Additionally, this methodology can be rapidly transplanted into different regions and it is helpful for dynamic land-use monitoring and precision agriculture."

We classified tamarisk distribution in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, Arizona using 0.2 m resolution, airborne multispectral data and estimated tamarisk beetle effects (overall accuracy of 86 percent) leading to leaf defoliation in a 49,408 m2area. We also estimated individual tamarisk tree biomass and their uncertainties using airborne lidar data (100 points/m2). On average, total aboveground tamarisk biomass was 8.68 kg/m2 (SD= 17.6). The tamarisk beetle defoliation resulted in a mean leaf biomass loss of 0.52 kg/m2and an equivalent of 25,692 kg across the entire study area. Our defoliated tamarisk map and biomass estimates can help inform restoration treatments to reduce tamarisk. Continued monitoring of tamarisk and tamarisk beetle effects are recommended to understand the currently-unknown eventual equilibrium between the two species and the cascading effects on ecosystem processes."

Three scenarios based on the extracted features are investigated to estimate the conductivity. In scenario one, only radar backscatter coefficients are considered. In scenario 2, in addition to the backscatter features an average of backscatter in a sliding 3 × 3 window is used. In scenario 3, texture features are added, including statistical and wavelet features. The results show that using all backscatter and texture features (scenario 3) results in better correlation performance, with an 11 to 27 percent improvement compared to scenario 1 and a 1 to 17 percent improvement over scenario 2."

The relief displacements of elevated objects in such images usually lead to significant misregistration that negatively affects the accuracy of change detection. This paper presents a novel solution, called Patch-Wise CoRegistration (PWCR), that can overcome the misregistration problem caused by viewing angle difference and accordingly improve the accuracy of urban change detection. The PWCR method utilizes a Digital Surface Model (DSM) and the Rational Polynomial Coefficients (RPCs) of the images to find corresponding points in a bi-temporal image set. The corresponding points are then used to generate corresponding patches in the image set. To prove that the PWCR method can overcome the misregistration problem and help achieving accurate change detection, two change detection criteria are tested and incorporated into a change detection framework. Experiments on four bi-temporal image sets acquired by Ikonos, GeoEye-1, and Worldview-2 satellites from different viewing angles show that the PWCR method can achieve highly accurate image patch coregistration (up to 80 percent higher than traditional coregistration for elevated objects), so that the change detection framework can produce accurate urban change detection results (over 90 percent)."

However, off-nadir VHR images over urban areas contain many occlusions due to building leaning that creates gaps in the extracted disparity maps. The typical approach to fill these gaps is by interpolation. However, it inevitably degrades the quality of the disparity map and reduces the accuracy of building detection. Thus, this research proposes a registration-based technique for mapping the disparity of off-terrain objects to avoid the need for disparity interpolation and normalization. The generated disparity by the proposed technique is then used to support building detection in off-nadir VHR satellite images. Experiments in a high-rise building area confirmed that 75 percent of the detected building roofs overlap precisely the reference data, with almost 100 percent correct detection. These accuracies are substantially higher than those achieved by other published research."

The objective of this study is to develop an innovative non-contact photogrammetric system to meet the challenge for monitoring the fast surface deformation of a laboratory-simulated landslide, which can detect pre-failure events and the final failure, provide sectional and overall surface deformation patterns, and generate speed maps during the rapid slope failure. We proposed an event detector based on altered surface features in the slower SLRC (single-lensreflex camera) image sequence to detect pre-failure events, while a combined analysis tool used the surface velocity fields and deformation areas based on fast HSCS (high-speed stereocamera system) stereo image sequences to reveal fast-changing landslide behavior during the short final failure. The introduced surface change detector uses the percentage of sliding block areas, percentage of changed features, and average speeds. It successfully detected four pre-failure local collapse events and the final slope failure; the extent of surface changes reached its maximum to accumulate energy 1.5 seconds before the failure when the average speed of changed features achieved its peak of 0.8 m/s. The developed system achieved a position accuracy of 3.8 mm and a speed accuracy of 0.11 m/s. The analysis result demonstrated a time period of 66 minutes before the failure which is confirmed by significant signals from both imaging and contact sensors and is important for landslide early warning. A field implementation scheme in western China will be designed and realized in the near future."
Geometrical Consistency Voting Strategy for Outlier Detection in Image Matching,"Lu, Luping; Zhang, Yong; Tao, Pengjie",pp. 559-570(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2016/00000082/00000007/art00025;jsessionid=4pbm3l39679k7.x-ic-live-01,"False matches in tie-point image matching are common. This paper introduces a straightforward and effective prepossessing method to reject false matches from initial matches. The method is based on the idea of Hough transform using only two geometrical consistency parameters, namely, the scale parameter and the rotation parameter between two images. A weighted voting strategy is employed, and it can further improve the robustness of the algorithm. The method can handle a large rate of outliers and produce more robust matches with low complexity. No assumptions with regard to the relative pose between two images are necessary, and large perspective deformation can be handled as well. Experiments with ground reference data show that the algorithm works effectively even when the ratio of inliers is below 10 percent. In these data, the ratio of inliers can be improved from 5 percent to 40 percent on average."

Accuracies range between 30 percent to 90 percent for the dead tree class and are significantly higher for the spatial-contextual approach. Inclusion of spectral transforms increased accuracies by 5 percent for the true object-based approach, up to 13 percent for the spatial contextual approach, and reduced commission error up to 10 percent for both approaches. Masking techniques increased accuracies of the spatial contextual approach by 20 percent. With manual editing, the most accurate maps of individual live and dead trees from the spatial contextual approach are suitable for studying spatio-temporal trends in montane conifer mortality."
An Assessment of Algorithmic Parameters Affecting Image Classification Accuracy by Random Forests,"Di Shi; Yang, Xiaojun",pp. 407-417(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2016/00000082/00000006/art00010;jsessionid=1ddau9aq5fkc5.x-ic-live-02,"Random forests as a promising ensemble learning algorithm have been increasingly used for remote sensor image classification, and are found to perform identical or better than some popular classifiers. With only two algorithmic parameters, they are relatively easier to implement. Existing literature suggests that the performance of random forests is insensitive to changing algorithmic parameters. However, this was largely based on the classifier's accuracy that does not necessarily represent the resulting thematic map accuracy. The current study extends beyond the classifier's accuracy assessment and investigate how the algorithmic parameters could affect the resulting thematic map accuracy by random forests. A set of random forest models with different parameter settings was carefully constructed and then used to classify a satellite image into multiple land cover categories. Both the classifier's accuracy and the map accuracy were assessed. The results reveal that these parameters can affect the map accuracy up to 9 ∼16 percent for some classes, although their impact on the classifier's accuracy was quite limited. A careful parameterization prioritizing thematic map accuracy can help improve the performance of random forests in image classification, especially for spectrally complex land cover classes. These findings can help establish practical guidance on the use of random forests in the remote sensing community."
A Statistical Examination of Image Stitching Software Packages For Use With Unmanned Aerial Systems,"Gross, John W.; Heumann, Benjamin W.",pp. 419-425(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2016/00000082/00000006/art00013;jsessionid=1ddau9aq5fkc5.x-ic-live-02,"There is growing demand for the collection of ultra-high spatial resolution imagery, such as is collected using unmanned aerial systems (UAS). Traditional methods of aerial photogrammetry are often difficult or time consuming to utilize due to the lack of sufficiently accurate ancillary information. The goal of this study was to compare geometric accuracy, visual quality, and price of three commonly available mosaicking software packages which offer a highly automated alternative to traditional methods: Photoscan Pro, Pix4D Pro Mapper, and Microsoft Image Composite Editor (ICE). A total of 223 images with a spatial resolution of 1.26 cm were collected by a UAS along with 70 ground control points. Microsoft Image Composite Editor had significantly fewer visual errors (Chi Square, p < .001), but it had the poorest geometric accuracy with a RMSE of 34.7 cm (Tukey-Kramer, p < 0.05). Photoscan had the most visual errors (Chi Square, p < 0.001), and a RMSE of 10.9 cm. Pix4D had the best geometric accuracy with a RMSE of 7.7 cm, however this was not found to be statistically different from Photoscan (Tukey-Kramer, p > 0.05). In terms of price, Microsoft Image Composite Editor was the least expensive while Pix4D was the most expensive, although specific pricing varies depending on the type of licensing needed. These results suggest that unless high geometric accuracy or 3D images are required, ICE is the best option for most UAS photogrammetric applications."
Correction of Atmospheric Refraction Geolocation Error for High Resolution Optical Satellite Pushbroom Images,"Yan, Ming; Wang, Chengyi; Ma, Jianglin; Wang, Zhiyong; Yu, Bingyang",pp. 427-435(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2016/00000082/00000006/art00015;jsessionid=1ddau9aq5fkc5.x-ic-live-02,"When an optical remote sensing satellite is imaging the Earth in-orbit, the propagation direction of the Line of Sight (LOS) will be changed because of atmospheric refraction. This will result in a geolocation deviation on the collinear rigorous geometric model for direct georeferencing, pushbroom images. To estimate and correct the atmospheric refraction geolocation error, the LOS vector tracking algorithm is introduced and a weighted mean algorithm is used to simplify the ISO standard atmospheric model into a troposphere and stratosphere, i.e., two layers spherical atmosphere. The simulation result shows the atmospheric refraction will introduce about 2 m and 7.5 m geometric displacement when the spacecraft is off-pointed view at 30 and 45 degree angle, respectively. For a state-of-the-art high resolution satellite, the atmospheric refraction displacement shall be corrected. The method has been practiced in the DMC3/TripleSat Constellation to remove the atmospheric refraction geolocation error without ground control points."
Predicting Palustrine Wetland Probability Using Random Forest Machine Learning and Digital Elevation Data-Derived Terrain Variables,"Maxwell, Aaron E.; Warner, Timothy A.; Strager, Michael P.",pp. 437-447(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2016/00000082/00000006/art00016;jsessionid=1ddau9aq5fkc5.x-ic-live-02,"The probability of palustrine wetland occurrence in the state of West Virginia, USA, was mapped based on topographic variables and using random forests (RF) machine learning. Models were developed for both selected ecological subregions and the entire state. The models were first trained using pixels randomly selected from the United States National Wetland Inventory (NWI) dataset and were tested using a separate random subset from the NWI and a database of wetlands not found in the NWI provided by the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources (WVDNR). The models produced area under the curve (AUC) values in excess of 0.90, and as high as 0.998. Models developed in one ecological subregion of the state produced significantly different AUC values when applied to other subregions, indicating that the topographical models should be extrapolated to new physiographic regions with caution. Several previously unexplored DEM-derived terrain variables were found to be of value, including distance from water bodies, roughness, and dissection. Non-NWI wetlands were mapped with an AUC value of 0.956, indicating that the probability maps may be useful for finding potential palustrine wetlands not found in the NWI ."
Camera Self-Calibration with Lens Distortion from a Single Image,"Liu, Dan; Liu, Xuejun; Wang, Meizhen",pp. 325-334(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2016/00000082/00000005/art00012;jsessionid=kks97b4hx4sj.x-ic-live-03,"This paper presents an effective approach for self-calibration with lens distortion using a single image combined with geometric constraints including vanishing points and ellipses. To improve the accuracy of self-calibration, radial distortion and distortion center are included in the calibration procedure. First, assuming image center as the symmetric center, the first radial distortion coefficient and vanishing points are simultaneously optimized from line segments in the image. Second, by utilizing the optimized vanishing points and extracted ellipse, principal distance and principal point are estimated. Last, distortion center is set as the current calculated principal point, and the above steps are then repeated until the principal point reaches a stable solution. Extensive quantitative and qualitative studies of the approach are performed. The experiments pertaining to simulated and real images demonstrate that the approach is effective and suitable and that the approach obtains satisfactory results."
Extraction of Urban Impervious Surface Using Two-Season WorldView-2 Images: A Comparison,"Cai, Cai; Li, Peijun; Jin, Huiran",pp. 335-349(15),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2016/00000082/00000005/art00013;jsessionid=kks97b4hx4sj.x-ic-live-03,"Although multispectral images acquired during the summer season have been used extensively in impervious surface extraction with relatively high accuracy, the area of impervious surface extracted is generally underestimated. In this study, a quantitative comparison of urban impervious surface extraction was conducted using WorldView-2 images of the summer and winter seasons over two urban areas in a temperate region of Northern China. A hierarchical object-based classification method was adopted to extract urban impervious surfaces. The results showed that the impervious surface extraction from the winter image achieved an accuracy comparable with that from the summer image. However, the area of impervious surface extracted from the winter image was much greater than that from the summer image, which was mainly attributed to seasonal variations of deciduous trees. Therefore, winter images are recommended for impervious surface mapping in temperate regions using very high resolution images."

The effect of data inconsistencies, on two GLAS height retrieval methods, from three study sites, are investigated and validated against airborne laser scanning (ALS) percentile heights, from three data sources: all/first return point clouds, and raster canopy height models. GLAS/ALS controls were established as a basis against which the influence of laser number, transmission energy, and seasonality were assessed through comparison statistics. The favored GLAS height method best compared with ALS 95thpercentile heights from an all return point cloud. Optimal GLAS data (R2= 0.69, RMSE = 8.10 m) were noted when GLAS acquired data during summertime from high energy, laser three transmissions. As GLAS data can be used in global biomass assessments, there is a need to understand and quantify the influence of these data inconsistencies on canopy height estimates."
A Novel Automatic Structural Linear Feature-based Matching Method Based on New Concepts of Mathematically-Generated-Points and Lines,"Yavari, Somayeh; Zoej, Mohammad Javad Valadan; Sahebi, Mahmod Reza; Mokhtarzade, Mehdi",pp. 365-376(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2016/00000082/00000005/art00018;jsessionid=kks97b4hx4sj.x-ic-live-03,"This paper investigates reliable automatic high resolution image to map matching using a novel structural linear feature-based matching (SLIM) method. The main components used by this method are the specific patterns as well as the lines and points generated mathematically. These components are produced by extension and intersection of extracted line-segments. Due to the high numbers of extracted line-segments in both image and object space, the number of possible patterns is very high. In order to decrease the search space, the innovativeSLIMmethod is performed in three main phases. In the first phase, using a new weighting procedure, only optimum numbers of high-qualified well-distributed patterns, which are more likely to have any correspondence in object space, are selected. In the second phase, the aim is to find a pair with maximum numbers of conjugate lines. To do so, all the possible patterns in object space are screened for each selected image pattern using four predefined geometric criteria. Simultaneously, the correspondence of the other crossing lines is also determined in the same manner. In third phase, the pair with maximum numbers of matched-lines is selected among all the results of second phase. Additionally, the final-phase is done to increase the amount of correctly matched-lines. The main contribution of this investigation is automatic and correct matching of linear features with no need to any initial information. Additionally, the end-points of the corresponding lines are not necessarily conjugate points. The results show the high potential of the proposed method in terms of accuracy, reliability, automation, and time reduction even in images with repetitive patterns or a high numbers of outliers."

The paper proposes achieving complete automation in the ortho-rectification process by eliminating all the interactive components, and incorporating fault tolerance mechanisms within the model to make the process robust and reliable. The key aspects proposed in this paper are: two stage Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) based matching to obtain a large numbers of checkpoints using much coarser resolution images such as Landsat/ETM+, followed by a GA to select the right combination of minimal GCPS based on minimizing Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and maximizing the area covered under GCPS, and finally, a decision rule based product evaluation to make the process operate in an ""autonomous closed loop mode"". The method is generic and has been tested on hundreds of Cartosat-1/2 images, and has achieved above 90% reliability with sub-pixel relative error of reference data."
Automatic Point Cloud Registration Using a Single Octagonal Lamp Pole,"On Chan, Ting; Lichti, Derek D.; Belton, David; Nguyen, Hoang Long",pp. 257-269(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2016/00000082/00000004/art00015;jsessionid=kfwf81cls98c.x-ic-live-02,"Registration is an essential procedure for merging point clouds defined in different coordinate systems associated to different scanner positions and orientations. It is usually the first step before the point clouds are further processed to provide spatial information of a scene to support engineering applications. In this paper, a new automatic registration method based on a novel geometric model of a polygonal object is presented. Since the cross section of the shaft of many lamp poles is octagonal, registration based on an octagonal pyramid model is proposed. The presented method only requires a single, common octagonal lamp pole observed in both point clouds, though actual overlap of the point clouds is not strictly required. It can be performed as long as the model parameters can be estimated by fitting the point observations to the model. Moreover, no user interaction is needed to derive approximate values, so the proposed registration can be completely automated. Three independent datasets captured by two scanners were used to verify the method. The registration accuracies in the horizontal and vertical directions were up to 11.7 mm and 4.4 mm at approximately 62 m and 17 m away from the scanner, respectively. With such high accuracies, the estimated registration parameters can serve as a set of initial parameters for fine registration using algorithm such as the iterative closest point (ICP)."
Estimating Forest and Woodland Aboveground Biomass Using Active and Passive Remote Sensing,"Wu, Zhuoting; Dye, Dennis; Vogel, John; Middleton, Barry",pp. 271-281(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2016/00000082/00000004/art00017;jsessionid=kfwf81cls98c.x-ic-live-02,"Aboveground biomass was estimated from active and passive remote sensing sources, including airborne lidar and Landsat-8 satellites, in an eastern Arizona (USA) study area comprised of forest and woodland ecosystems. Compared to field measurements, airborne lidar enabled direct estimation of individual tree height with a slope of 0.98 (R2= 0.98). At the plot-level, lidar-derived height and intensity metrics provided the most robust estimate for aboveground biomass, producing dominant species-based aboveground models with errors ranging from 4 to 14Mg ha–1across all woodland and forest species. Landsat-8 imagery produced dominant species-based aboveground biomass models with errors ranging from 10 to 28Mg ha–1. Thus, airborne lidar allowed for estimates for fine-scale aboveground biomass mapping with low uncertainty, while Landsat-8 seems best suited for broader spatial scale products such as a national biomass essential climate variable (ECV) based on land cover types for the United States."

To improve our understanding of soils through stand-off sensing techniques, Light Detection and Ranging was used to monitor the signature of retroreflective beads embedded in polymeric agents on four soils. Our goal was to generate probability density functions (PDFs) for stochastic predictions of the persistence of this signature through time. Our findings showed that thePDFsof the reflected signal between target and background soils became nearly indistinguishable after five months and that OM, nitrogen content, cation exchange capacity, and pH related to signature decline. This approach, while developed using polymer-bound retroreflectors, will serve as a framework where a signature-emitter is left in or on soil and differentially influenced by terrain, weather, and soil processes."
Combined Calibration Method Based on Rational Function Model for the Chinese GF-1 Wide-Field-of-View Imagery,"Wang, Taoyang; Zhang, Guo; Jiang, Yonghua; Wang, Siyue; Huang, Wenchao; Li, Litao",pp. 291-298(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2016/00000082/00000004/art00020;jsessionid=kfwf81cls98c.x-ic-live-02,"The internal geometric distortion of charge-coupled-device (CCD) chips degrades the internal geometric accuracy of satellite images. Even if a large number of ground control points (GCPs) are used for geometric correction, the satellite images cannot always be used for direct mapping. Because of the current lack of core parameters for building a rigorous geometric model, this paper proposes a combined interior-orientation calibration method based on the rational function model (RFM) for multipleGF-1wide-field-of-view (WFV) images of the same general scene. A polynomial model of look angles in the image space is chosen to compensate for the systemic error of CCD chips. After calibration for sensors 1 to 4, the orientation accuracy is improved to 0.4 pixels. Moreover, the residual error figures show no obvious trend. OtherGF-1WFV images are calibrated using the obtained interior-orientation parameters, and the improvement in their orientation accuracy is demonstrated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."
Approximating Prediction Uncertainty for Random Forest Regression Models,"Coulston, John W.; Blinn, Christine E.; Thomas, Valerie A.; Wynne, Randolph H.",pp. 189-197(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2016/00000082/00000003/art00016;jsessionid=1rgmrv228ca6a.x-ic-live-03,"Machine learning approaches such as random forest have increased for the spatial modeling and mapping of continuous variables. Random forest is a non-parametric ensemble approach, and unlike traditional regression approaches there is no direct quantification of prediction error. Understanding prediction uncertainty is important when using model-based continuous maps as inputs to other modeling applications such as fire modeling. Here we use a Monte Carlo approach to quantify prediction uncertainty for random forest regression models. We test the approach by simulating maps of dependent and independent variables with known characteristics and comparing actual errors with prediction errors. Our approach produced conservative prediction intervals across most of the range of predicted values. However, because the Monte Carlo approach was data driven, prediction intervals were either too wide or too narrow in sparse parts of the prediction distribution. Overall, our approach provides reasonable estimates of prediction uncertainty for random forest regression models."

The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of using more easily automated image composites techniques, such as median Landsat-5 image composites or maximumNDVILandsat-5 image composites, as alternatives to model II regression mosaics for the modeling ofPTCC. This study found all composite types were effective in modelingPTCC, but the maximumNDVIcomposites included anomalies, clouds, shadows, and tended to be pixelated, whereas the median composites and the model II regression mosaics had none of these issues. The median composite procedure is automated and was found to be an effective approach to statistically reduce a much larger ensemble of images on a pixel basis to create images suitable for vegetation modeling."

In proposed method, the features selected from a single labeled image can be used in segmentation of images captured by different satellites with similar spatial resolution. The selected feature types contain spatial and spectral features. The selected features are applied for segmentation of the images captured by QuickBird and GeoEye satellites and obtained results of proposed method are compared with well-knownFSmethods. Using different evaluation measures, our comparison shows the efficiency of the proposed method in providing better segmentation compared to otherFSmethods that are presented in this paper."

Computer aided design models of suspected aircraft components were superimposed, and a feature common in multiple mosaicked images was used to identify a common feature between purported objects to assess goodness of fit. The superimposition method was replicated using landing gear from a reference aircraft and a rope of known dimensions, and favorably compared against the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) analysis results."

In this regard, a novel geometric criterion is introduced. Result of theOWAaggregation specifies weight of each edge in the road network graph. Comparing the proposed approach with two state-of-the-art image space clustering-based road vectorization methods proves its efficiency to deal with roads with different widths, parallel roads with different distances, different types of intersections, and also noise clusters. Obtaining improved quality measures for several high-resolution images, demonstrates the successfulness of the vectorization approach."

One of the most difficult steps in the automatic mosaicking of orthoimages is the seamline determination. This paper presents a novel algorithm that selects seamlines based on marker-based watershed segmentation. A representative seamline is extracted at the object level and the pixel level as follows. First, a watershed segmentation is performed to obtain the objects. To avoid over-segmentation, a regional adaptive marker-based watershed segmentation is proposed. Second, the object difference estimated by the correlation coefficient of each object is calculated, and the region adjacency matrix is built. Third, a technique for minimizing the maximum object cost is adopted to determine the objects through which the seamlines pass. Finally, pixel-level optimization is performed using Dijkstra's algorithm with a binary min-heap to determine the final seamlines. The experimental results on digital aerial orthoimages in different areas demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method compared with other algorithms."

The results showed that the topographic attributes derived fromSRTMdata could adequately represent the terrain of China. However, there were extended and observable areas with abnormalities in a small proportion of the data. Slope was the dominant factor affecting elevation error compared with other landscape features (aspect, vegetation, etc.). The mean errors in glaciers, deserts and wetlands were -1.05 m, -2.03 m and -2.43 m, and 1.05 m in built-up areas. In general the elevation errors in theSRTMdata formed a complex pattern of variation across China."

The proposed solution for accurate object-to-object comparison is based on an intermediate registration of object-based classification results with a piecewise affine transformation followed by robust, geometry-based techniques for sliver removal. Although different remote sensing applications require different strategies and methods for object-based change detection, the approach developed in this paper can overcome the overall limitation introduced by the slivers generated by weak geo-localization, variable off-nadir angles, and image segmentation."

A morphological filtering algorithm at the detected continuous scales is developed to decompose a house into reshaped slices, which will be reconstructed as a dome. Thus, the domes are separate despite the joined houses, and are used to extract the markers of the houses. Finally, processes based on markers are developed to segment and model the houses. Among which, the multiple spectral image is used to detect the trees in the scene. Compared with other extraction methods, our technique decreases the fragment rate from 7.4 percent to 0.9 percent, the mixing rate from 14.8 percent to 0.9 percent."
A Merging Solution for Close-Range DEMs to Optimize Surface Coverage and Measurement Resolution,"Bertin, Stephane; Friedrich, Heide; Delmas, Patrice",pp. 31-40(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2016/00000082/00000001/art00015;jsessionid=e4ps3qffnc2os.x-ic-live-03,"The process of efficient and effectiveDEMmerging is increasingly becoming more important. To allowDEManalysis for features of different scales, an increase in surface coverage cannot result in reduced measurement resolution. It is thus inevitable that merging individual high-resolutionDEMs will become common practice for applications such as hydraulic roughness studies for fluvial surfaces. This paper presents an efficient and effective merging solution, whereby accurate co-registration of individualDEMs collected from consistent viewpoints and standard averaging for overlapping elevations ensure seamless merging. The presented method is suitable forDEMs collected using any measurement technology, as long as individualDEMs overlap and are arranged on regular grids. The merging solution is applied to the study of a laboratory gravel bed measured with vertical stereo photogrammetry at the grain scale (>106points/m2). We show that the approach can be integrated into theDEMcollection workflow at the design stage, which optimizes the measurement performance. We present how resampling before merging can be beneficial to keep data handling requirements practical, whilst ensuring accurate surface representation. Finally, the effect of scale variation is studied, showing that seamless merging applies toDEMs with variable resolution."
Estimation of Forest Biomass Using Multivariate Relevance Vector Regression,"Sharifi, Alireza; Amini, Jalal; Tateishi, Ryutaro",pp. 41-49(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2016/00000082/00000001/art00016;jsessionid=e4ps3qffnc2os.x-ic-live-03,"The objective of this study is to develop a method based on multivariate relevance vector regression (MVRVR) as a kernel-based Bayesian model for the estimation of above-ground biomass (AGB) in the Hyrcanian forests of Iran. FieldAGBdata from the Hyrcanian forests and multi-temporalPALSARback-scatter values are used for training and testing the methods. The results of theMVRVRmethod are then compared with other methods: multivariate linear regression (MLR), multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), and support vector regression (SVR). TheMLRmodel showed lower values of R2 than the three other approaches. Although theSVRmodel was found to be more accurate thanMLPNN, it had the lowest saturation point of 224.75 Mg/ha. The use ofMVRVRmodel significantly improves the estimation ofAGB(R2= 0.90;RMSE= 32.05 Mg/ha), and the model showed a superior performance in estimatingAGBwith the highest saturation point (297.81 Mg/ha)."
Discriminating Spectral Signatures Among and Within Two Closely Related Grapevine Species,"Maimaitiyiming, Matthew; Miller, Allison J.; Ghulam, Abduwasit",pp. 51-62(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2016/00000082/00000001/art00018;jsessionid=e4ps3qffnc2os.x-ic-live-03,"Several North American Vitis species are used to breed scions and rootstocks, including V. riparia and V. rupestris. However, the degree to which Vitis species can be distinguished using remote sensing is not well known. Here we explore whether two North American Vitis species and genotypes growing in a common garden can be discriminated with leaf and canopy hyperspectral reflectance factor data (350-2500 nm) using independent t-test and derivative analysis. Foliar properties and spectral indices of the grapevines were evaluated with analysis of the variance (ANOVA) and pair-wise Bonferroni adjusted t-tests. The results showed that V. riparia and V. rupestris can be distinguished at the leaf level spectra of visible, near- and infrared spectral regions. At the canopy level, genotypes were spectrally discriminated with limited success. The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) demonstrated the highest potential not only to differentiate two species, but also two genotype pair groups within V. rupestris. This finding was also true for the PRI calculated with simulated EO-1 Hyperion data. These capacities to distinguish Vitis species, and to a lesser extent genotypes, using spectral signatures have important applications in remote monitoring of vineyards for plants health and also for locating wild Vitis populations for future crop improvement efforts."
High-resolution Land Cover and Impervious Surface Classifications in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area with NAIP Imagery,"Nagel, Philipp; Yuan, Fei",pp. 63-71(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2016/00000082/00000001/art00019;jsessionid=e4ps3qffnc2os.x-ic-live-03,"High-resolution land-use and land-cover (LULC) and impervious surface maps were traditionally created by time-consuming field surveys or aerial photo interpretation and digitizing methods. In the United States, the recent availability of 1 m digital color orthoimagery through the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) offers an opportunity to update land cover maps for areas of interest. In this study, an object-based feature extraction and a regression tree technique were applied to theNAIPimagery for the Twin Cities Metropolitan Areas (TCMA) of Minnesota. An overall accuracy of 74 percent and 95 percent was achieved for the generalLULCclassification and the impervious surface map, respectively. It was found that both techniques could be used to extract impervious surfaces from theNAIPimagery with relatively high accuracy. TheLULCclassification results were compared to the 2006 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and another Landsat-based 2006 classification. Implications for future classification studies were also discussed."
Urban Classification by the Fusion of Thermal Infrared Hyperspectral and Visible Data,"Li, Jiayi; Zhang, Hongyan; Guo, Min; Zhang, Liangpei; Shen, Huanfeng; Du, Qian",pp. 901-911(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2015/00000081/00000012/art00013;jsessionid=6tec2mbfec1il.x-ic-live-01,"The 2014 Data Fusion Contest, organized by the Image Analysis and Data Fusion (IADF) Technical Committee of the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society, involved two datasets acquired at different spectral ranges and spatial resolutions: a coarser-resolution long-wave infrared (LWIR, thermal infrared) hyperspectral data set and fine-resolution data acquired in the visible (VIS) wavelength range. In this article, a novel multi-level fusion approach is proposed to fully utilize the characteristics of these two different datasets to achieve improved urban land-use and land-cover classification. Specifically, road extraction by fusing the classification result of the TI-HSI dataset and the segmentation result of theVISdataset is first proposed. Thereafter, a novel gap inpainting method for the VIS data with the guidance of the TI-HSI data is presented to deal with the swath width inconsistency, and to facilitate an accurate spatial feature extraction step. The experimental results with the 2014 Data Fusion Contest datasets suggest that the proposed method can alleviate the multi-spectral-spatial resolution and multi-swath width problem to a great extent, and achieve an improved urban classification accuracy."
Automated Detection of Martian Gullies from HiRISE Imagery,"Li, Wei; Di, Kaichang; Yue, Zongyu; Liu, Yiliang; Sun, Shujuan",pp. 913-920(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2015/00000081/00000012/art00014;jsessionid=6tec2mbfec1il.x-ic-live-01,"Gully is a type of young geological feature on the Martian surface, and the study of gullies can significantly contribute to understanding of the geologic history of Martian surface. As a large amount of high-resolution orbital images have been acquired, manual identification and extraction of all gullies is tedious and prohibitively time consuming. Therefore, it is desirable to develop automated methods for detection of Martian gullies to support scientific studies of the gullies. This paper presents an automated gully detection method based on mathematical morphology techniques. The method integrates a series of morphological operators, including area opening and closing, Bottom-Hat transformation, and path opening. Experimental results using HiRISE images at six sites demonstrate promising performance with detection percentage from 76 percent to 94 percent."

The use of repeated statistical tests by remote sensing scientists to identify significant relationships, increases the chance identifying false positives (i.e., type-I errors) as the number of tests increases. This paper provides an introduction to the multiple comparison problem (i.e., the impact of the interpretation of p-values when repeated tests are made), outlines some simple solutions, and provides two case studies to demonstrate the potential impact of the problem in empirical remote sensing. The first case study looks at multiple potential texture metrics to predict leaf area index. The second case study examines pixel-wise temporal trend detection. The results show how applying solutions to the multiple comparison problem can greatly impact the interpretation of statistical results."
Geometric Accuracy Analysis Model of the Ziyuan-3 Satellite without GCPs,"Tang, Xinming; Zhou, Ping; Zhang, Guo; Wang, Xia; Pan, Hongbo",pp. 927-934(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2015/00000081/00000012/art00016;jsessionid=6tec2mbfec1il.x-ic-live-01,"The ZiYuan-3 satellite (ZY-3) was China's first civilian stereo mapping satellite designed to meet the 1:50 000 scale mapping requirements. We analyzed main error sources influencing the geometric accuracy of theZY-3images, and the error propagation rules of these error sources in image production. Accuracy estimation models ofZY-3images without ground control points (GCPs) were deduced and the theoretical geometric accuracy ofZY-3images was obtained. WithoutGCPs, 556ZY-3panchromatic nadir images covering 3,500,000 km2of the Chinese mid-west region and 12ZY-3stereo image pairs covering 14,000 km 2 around Taiyuan of China were used for planar and vertical accuracy verification, respectively. The experimental results confirmed the correctness of the accuracy estimation model forZY-3images. The accuracy results obtained through the model and experiment showed that withoutGCPs, the geometric accuracy of theZY-3images satisfied the Chinese stereo mapping requirements for 1:50 000 scale topographic maps."

However, reliability of the linear relationship of these variables has not been thoroughly examined. In this study we find that the actual overall correlations are exponential rather than linear. More specific analyses showed that the DN values of nighttime light imagery first behaves linearly (from 3 to 50) and then exponentially (from 51 to 63), correlating to the amount of CO2emissions. Regardless of the use of a linear or piecewise function, some featured limitations are evident as we developed the methodology. Among significant limitations, CO2emissions were not visualized in unlit areas and a lack of variation existed in regions with the same DN values of nighttime light imagery. Lastly CO2emissions in urban core areas were grossly under-estimated."

The method provides an estimate of the global horizontal position of a vehicle strictly based on finding a geometric match between a map of observed tree stems, scanned in 3D by Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) sensors onboard the vehicle, to another stem map generated from the structure of tree crowns analyzed from high resolution aerial orthoimagery of the forest canopy. The method has been tested with real-world data and has been able to estimate vehicle geoposition with an average error of less than 2 m. The method has two key properties that are significant: (a) The algorithm does not requirea prioriknowledge of the area surrounding the robot, and (b) Based on estimated vehicle state, it uses the geometry of detected tree stems as the only input to determine horizontal geoposition."
Automatic Co-Registration of Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) Video Images with 3D Wireframe Models,"Persad, Ravi Ancil; Armenakis, Costas; Sohn, Gunho",pp. 847-859(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2015/00000081/00000011/art00012;jsessionid=3hi0rnn6sqcav.x-ic-live-02,"We propose an algorithm for the automatic co-registration of Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) camera video images with 3D wireframe models. The proposed method automatically retrieves changing camera focal length and angular parameters, due to the motion of PTZ cameras by matching linear features between PTZ video images and 3D CAD wireframe models. The developed feature-matching schema is based on a novel evidence-based hypothesis-verification optimization framework referred to as Line-based Randomized RAN dom SA mple Consensus (LR-RANSAC). LR-RANSAC introduces a fast and stable pre-verification test into the optimization process to avoid unnecessary verification of erroneous hypotheses. An evidence-based verification follows to optimally select the PTZ camera parameters, where an original line-based approach for full-verification, -exploiting local geometrical cues on the image scene-, evaluates the pre-verified hypotheses. Tests on an indoor dataset produced a 0.06 mm error in focal length estimation and rotational errors in the order of 0.18° to 0.24°. Experiments on the outdoor dataset resulted in a 0.07 mm error for focal length and rotational errors ranging from 0.19° to 0.30°."
An Effective Antarctic Ice Surface Temperature Retrieval Method for MODIS,"Liu, Tingting; Wang, Zemin; Huang, Xin; Cao, Liqin; Niu, Muye; Tian, Zhongxiang",pp. 861-872(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2015/00000081/00000011/art00013;jsessionid=3hi0rnn6sqcav.x-ic-live-02,"Given the close relationship between surface melt in polar areas and ice surface temperature (IST), it is important to develop an effective IST retrieval method.

The effectiveness was quantitatively validated by a comparative study with a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) IST product (MOD29) and automatic weather station (AWS) data. The comparisons indicated that the proposed method shows a robust performance in Antarctic IST retrieval for MODIS data: the bias was –0.61 K and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 1.32 K for the Zhongshan Station data set; the bias was –1.62 K and the RMSE was 2.34 K for the Ross Ice Shelf data set."
A Geometric Method for Wood-Leaf Separation Using Terrestrial and Simulated Lidar Data,"Tao, Shengli; Guo, Qinghua; Xu, Shiwu; Su, Yanjun; Li, Yumei; Wu, Fangfang",pp. 767-776(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2015/00000081/00000010/art00007;jsessionid=37kkfwr6dc0vh.x-ic-live-01,"Terrestrial light detection and ranging (lidar) can be used to record the three-dimensional structures of trees. Wood-leaf separation, which aims to classify lidar points into wood and leaf components, is an essential prerequisite for deriving individual tree characteristics. Previous research has tended to use intensity (including a multi-wavelength approach) and waveform information for wood-leaf separation, but use of the most fundamental information from a lidar point cloud, i.e., the x-, y-, and z- coordinates of each point, for this purpose has been poorly explored. In this study, we introduce a geometric method for wood-leaf separation using the x-, y-, and z- coordinates of each point. The separation results indicate that first-, second-, and third-order branches can be extracted from the raw point cloud by this new method, suggesting that it might provide a promising solution for wood-leaf separation."
Two Dimensional Linear Discriminant Analyses for Hyperspectral Data,"Imani, Maryam; Ghassemian, Hassan",pp. 777-786(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2015/00000081/00000010/art00008;jsessionid=37kkfwr6dc0vh.x-ic-live-01,"Most supervised feature extraction methods like linear discriminant analysis (LDA) suffer from the limited number of available training samples. The singularity problem causes LDA to fail in small sample size (SSS) situations. Two dimensional linear discriminant analysis (2DLDA) for feature extraction of hyperspectral images is proposed in this paper which has good efficiency with small training sample size. In this approach, the feature vector of each pixel of hyperspectral image is transformed into a feature matrix. As a result, the data matrices lie in a low-dimensional space. Then, the between-class and within-class scatter matrices are calculated using the matrix form of training samples. The proposed approach has two main advantages: it deals with the SSS problem in hyperspectral data, and also it can extract each number of features (with no limitation) from the original high dimensional data. The proposed method is tested on four widely used hyperspectral datasets. Experimental results confirm that the proposed 2DLDA feature extraction method provides better classification accuracy, with a reasonable computation time, compared to popular supervised feature extraction methods such as generalized discriminant analysis (GDA) and nonparametric weighted feature extraction (NWFE) particularly compared to the 1DLDA in the SSS situation. The experiments show that two dimensional linear discriminant analysis + support vector machine (2DLDA + SVM) is an appropriate choice for feature extraction and classification of hyperspectral images using limited training samples."

We outline results from two case studies using a commercially-available UAS, photogrammetry software, and an array of ground control and check points. Radial horizontal and vertical root-mean-square-errors (RMSE) were calculated as 0.05 m and 0.06 m, respectively, for one site, and 0.08 m and 0.03 m, respectively, for the other. Under the 1990 ASPRS standards, both surveys meet the requirements for Class 1 accuracy at the 1:500 map scale and at the 0.50 m contour interval. Under the newly-developed ASPRS standards, the reported errors fulfill the requirements for both horizontal and vertical mapping at the 10 cm RMSE level. Overall, these results provide initial direction for practitioners considering UAS surveying in the context of accuracy standards."

Our study used pixel-based and semi-object-based methods to classify a high spatial resolution QuickBird image acquired during the summer in northern China, where both saltcedar and cottonwood are native species. The pixel-based classification results revealed that spectral bands alone were not sufficient to discriminate saltcedar from cottonwood trees due to their similar foliage reflectance in the summer. Including texture measures did not improve the result. The unique crown shapes and shadows associated with sparsely distributed cottonwood were used to facilitate the semi object-based method. The overall accuracy of the object-based classification result increased 15 percent compared to that of the pixel-based classification results and showed significant improvement in the discrimination between saltcedar and cottonwood."

Potential contamination sources include attitude miscalculation, saturated echoes, equipment noise, the atmosphere, and variable elevation within footprints. For a study site located in Northern Canada, this multi-indicator filter provided a 19 percent reduction in the root mean square error for elevation, when compared to Canadian Digital Elevation Data (CDED). This result demonstrates the method's ability to provide an improved dataset for vertical accuracy evaluation, with respect to unfiltered GLA14 data. The improvement was achieved with a rejection rate of 69 percent. However, due to the high density of the unfiltered GLA14 data over the study site, a spatially homogeneous distribution of elevation points was maintained, even after filtering. Results also showed the rejection efficiency of most indicators, as well as their complementarity."

These data are used to assess overall pavement conditions and to make maintenance and repair decisions. Routinely-acquired and publically-available high spatial resolution (HSR) multispectral digital aerial photography provides a potential method for collecting distress information that can supplement or replace currently-used technologies. Principal component analysis and linear least squares regression models were used to evaluate the potential of using HSR multispectral digital aerial photographs to estimate pavement surface overall distress conditions. Various models were developed using HSR multispectral digital aerial photographs of different spatial resolution (6-inch, 12-inch, and 24-inch) and reference pavement surface distress data collected manually at multiple sample sites using standard protocols. The results show that the spectral response of HSR multispectral digital aerial photographs correlate strongly with reference distress rates at all tested spatial resolutions, but the 6-inch aerial photos exhibit the strongest correlation (R2> 0.95), even when using only half of the sample sites (R2> 0.92). These results indicate that straightforward analysis of HSR multispectral digital aerial photographs, routinely acquired by most municipalities and states, can permit assessment of pavement surface distress conditions as well as current manual evaluation protocols."

The algorithm removed cirrus clouds using Band 9 first, and the remaining thin clouds using quality assurance (QA) band. Using a Landsat-8 sub-image of 129/39 (path/row) acquired on 16 December 2013, we evaluated the algorithm. Thin clouds disappeared visually. Reflectance values of Bands 1 through 4 decreased in both steps. Reflectance values of Band 5 decreased in step one, and then stayed the same. With a nearly cloud-free image acquired on 30 November 2013 as the “truth,” the spatial correlation coefficients of cloud-covered pixels within the December image were 0.84 or higher. Changes in reflectance values of Bands 1 to 5, and the high correlation coefficient values indicated the validity of the algorithm."
Accurate Affine Invariant Image Matching Using Oriented Least Square,"Sedaghat, Amin; Ebadi, Hamid",pp. 733-743(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2015/00000081/00000009/art00012;jsessionid=7ufj4tbem0s4r.x-ic-live-03,"Image matching is a vital process for many photogrammetric and remote sensing applications such as image registration and aerial triangulation. In this paper, an accurate affine invariant image matching approach is presented. The proposed approach consists of three main steps. In the first step, two affine invariant feature detectors, including MSER and Harris-Affine features are applied for feature extraction. In the second step, initial corresponding features are selected using Euclidean distance between feature descriptors, followed by a consistency check process. Finally to overcome low positional accuracy of the local affine feature, an advanced version of the least square matching (LSM) namely, Oriented Least Square Matching (OLSM) is developed. Well-known LSM method has been widely accepted as one of the most accurate methods to obtain high reliable corresponding points from a stereo image pair. However, it is sensitive to significant geometric distortion and requires very good initial approximation. In the proposed OLSM method, shape and size of the matching window are appropriately approximated using obtained affine shape information of the initial elliptical feature pairs. The proposed method was successfully applied for matching various synthetic and real close range and satellite images. Results demonstrate its accuracy and capability compared to standard LSM method."

This study compares area-based vegetation structure metrics derived from multi-return ALS simulated at six pulse densities (0.05 to 4 pl m-2) across a range of forest types: from savannah woodlands to dense rainforests. Results suggest that accurate measurement of structure metrics (canopy height, canopy cover, and vertical canopy structure) can be achieved with a pulse density of 0.5 pl m-2across all forest types when compared to a dataset of 10 pl m-2. For pulse densities <0.5 pl m-2, two main sources of error lead to inaccuracies in estimation: the poor identification of the ground surface and sparse vegetation cover leading to under sampling of the canopy profile. This analysis provides useful information for land managers determining capture specifications for large-area ALS acquisitions."
An Unsupervised Urban Change Detection Procedure by Using Luminance and Saturation for Multispectral Remotely Sensed Images,"Ye, Su; Chen, Dongmei",pp. 637-645(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2015/00000081/00000008/art00012;jsessionid=1i6w7ekuerm8z.x-ic-live-01,"Unsupervised change detection techniques have been widely employed in the remote-sensing area when suitable reference data is not available. Image (or Index) differencing is one of the most commonly used methods due to its simplicity. However, past applications of image differencing were often inefficient in separating real change and noise due to the lack of steps for feature selection and integration of contextual information. To address these issues, we propose a novel unsupervised procedure which uses two complementary features, namely luminance and saturation, extracted from multispectral images, and combines T-point thresholding, Bayes fusion, and Markov Random Fields. Through a case study, the performance of our proposed procedure was compared with other three unsupervised change-detection methods including Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Fuzzy c-means (FCM), and Expectation Maximum-Markov Random Field (EM-MRF). The change detection results from our proposed method are more compact with less noise than those from other methods over urban areas. The quantitative accuracy assessment indicates that the overall accuracy and Kappa statistic of our proposed procedure are 95.1 percent and 83.3 percent, respectively, which are significantly higher than the other three unsupervised change detection methods."

Total US user benefits for the 2.38 million scenes downloaded is $1.8 billion USD. While these benefits indicate a high willingness-to-pay among many Landsat downloaders, it would be economically inefficient for the US government to charge for Landsat imagery. Charging a price of $100 USD a scene would result in an efficiency loss of $37.5 million a year. This economic information should be useful to policy-makers who must decide about the future of this and similar remote sensing programs."
Using International Standards to Control the Positional Quality of Spatial Data,"Ariza-López, F.J.; Rodríguez-Avi, J.",pp. 657-668(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2015/00000081/00000008/art00014;jsessionid=1i6w7ekuerm8z.x-ic-live-01,"A positional quality control method based on the application of the International Standard ISO 2859 is proposed. This entails a common framework for dealing with the control of all other spatial data quality components (e.g., completeness, consistency, etc.). We propose a relationship between the parameters “acceptable quality level” and “limiting quality” of the international standard and positional quality by means of observed error models. This proposal does not require any assumption for positional errors (e.g., normality), which means that the application is universal. It can be applied to any type of positional and geometric controls (points, line-strings), to any dimension (1D, 2D, 3D, etc.) and with parametric or non-parametric error models (e.g., lidar). This paper introduces ISO 2859, presents the statistical bases of the proposal and develops two examples of application, the first dealing with a lot-by-lot control and the second, isolated lot control."
Bioenergy Crop Identification at Field Scale Using VHR Airborne CIR Imagery,"Sohl, Muhammad Abdullah; Schlager, Patric; Schmieder, Klaus; Rafique, H.M.",pp. 669-677(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2015/00000081/00000008/art00015;jsessionid=1i6w7ekuerm8z.x-ic-live-01,"The present study is aimed at developing a methodology to extract maize, a predominant energy crop, and efficiently map its spatial distribution in a Natura 2000 region of northern Germany. Following a GEOBIA approach, segmentation was performed on two hierarchical levels. Level 1 consisted of field boundaries, and level 2 represented variations within level 1. Decision rules were developed for level 2 based on spectral information, vegetation indices, standard deviations and knowledge of crop phenology. For this purpose, first, level 2 image objects were classified. Subsequently classification was shifted to level 1. Maize covered 10.6 percent of total study area. The presented methodology gives the advanced user the flexibility to integrate expert knowledge in the classifier. In addition, the implementation time of decision rules was very fast and helped to produce results with high accuracy."
The Universal Lidar Error Model,"Rodarmel, Craig; Lee, Mark; Gilbert, John; Wilkinson, Ben; Theiss, Henry; Dolloff, John; O'Neill, Christopher",pp. 543-556(14),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2015/00000081/00000007/art00013;jsessionid=6qh7sn4q1pcl0.x-ic-live-02,"Methods to adjust multiple lidar datasets, to adjust lidar with other modalities, and to quantify lidar accuracy are limited. While lidar sensor modeling, error propagation, and data adjustment exist in literature, there are no known implementations supporting all three operations within existing file formats and processing architectures. The Universal Lidar Error Model (ULEM) has been developed to meet the community's need for rigorous error propagation and data adjustment. ULEM exploitation allows one to develop predicted error covariance at single points and full covariance among multiple points. It defines a standardized set of adjustable parameters, provides for the modeling and storage of correlations and cross-correlations among parameters, and stores the data within existing file formats. This paper provides an introduction to ULEM, its metadata requirements, and its model exploitation methods. It concludes with an example of ULEM error modeling, showing the predicted uncertainty agrees well with errors calculated from surveyed control."
"Rice Crop Discrimination Using Single Date RISAT1 Hybrid (RH, RV) Polarimetric Data","Uppala, Deepika; Kothapalli, Ramana Venkata; Poloju, Srikanth; Mullapudi, Sesha Sai Venkata Rama; Dadhwal, Vinay Kumar",pp. 557-563(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2015/00000081/00000007/art00014;jsessionid=6qh7sn4q1pcl0.x-ic-live-02,"Rice is the most important food grain crop in India and contributes to more than 40 percent of the country's food grain production. Spaceborne remote sensing offers economically viable and accurate production and area statistics. The utility of optical remote sensing in mapping rice cropped area is limited by persistent cloud cover during monsoon season. Temporal availability of SAR data has facilitated an operational procedure to monitor the rice crop. The current study discriminates rice crop, using single date hybrid polarimetric data available from RISAT-1 SAR. This was subjected to Raney m-δ, m-χ decompositions, and supervised classification was performed. The accuracy was estimated using the field points. The results were compared with rice map generated using optical sensor Resourcesat-2 LISS-IV and statistical data. The spatial agreement between the estimate from RISAT-1 and LISS-IV data was found to be 85 percent. The class kappa value was 0.94 and 0.92 for LISSIV and RISAT-1, respectively."
A Fast and Robust Scan-Line Search Algorithm for Object-to-Image Projection of Airborne Pushbroom Images,"Shen, Xiang; Wu, Guofeng; Sun, Ke; Li, Qingquan",pp. 565-572(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2015/00000081/00000007/art00017;jsessionid=6qh7sn4q1pcl0.x-ic-live-02,"The projection of a 3D object point onto a 2Dimage plane (i.e., the object-to-image projection) is one of the fundamental operations in photogrammetric data processing. Unlike that for a frame image, the object-to-image projection for a pushbroom image is not a straightforward process because each scan line is exposed at a distinct instant of time, and a preliminary step is therefore required to determine the corresponding scan-line coordinate of the ground point to be projected. This paper presents a new scan-line search algorithm for the object-to-image projection of airborne pushbroom images, which employs a coarse-to-fine strategy following four consecutive steps: affine transformation, iterative search, sequential search, and sub-pixel interpolation. The experimental results with 255 pushbroom images captured in various flight conditions show that the proposed algorithm is robust and can save at least 15 percent of the computational time when compared to the previous methods, while the latter often cannot yield correct results in strong turbulence scenarios."
A Landsat Data Tiling and Compositing Approach Optimized for Change Detection in the Conterminous United States,"Nelson, Kurtis J.; Steinwand, Daniel",pp. 573-586(14),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2015/00000081/00000007/art00018;jsessionid=6qh7sn4q1pcl0.x-ic-live-02,"Annual disturbance maps are produced by the LANDFIRE program across the conterminous United States (CONUS). Existing LANDFIRE disturbance data from 1999 to 2010 are available and current efforts will produce disturbance data through 2012. A tiling and compositing approach was developed to produce bi-annual images optimized for change detection. A tiled grid of 10,000 × 10,000 30 m pixels was defined for CONUS and adjusted to consolidate smaller tiles along national borders, resulting in 98 non-overlapping tiles. Data from Landsat-5,-7, and -8 were re-projected to the tile extents, masked to remove clouds, shadows, water, and snow/ice, then composited using a cosine similarity approach. The resultant images were used in a change detection algorithm to determine areas of vegetation change. This approach enabled more efficient processing compared to using single Landsat scenes, by taking advantage of overlap between adjacent paths, and allowed an automated system to be developed for the entire process."

Exploring the distribution of nationwide NPP helps to diagnose the response of ecosystems to natural/anthropogenic influences and resource management. Based on the CASA model, the MODIS-NDVI-derived spatiotemporal pattern of Mongolian NPP was analyzed by factorial ANOVA and regression analysis. Results showed that the nationwide distribution of NPP was coincidence with the distribution of terrestrial ecosystems. During the growing season, the monthly-NPP average of every terrestrial ecosystem behaved temporally as an inverse-U shape that peaked in June/July and varied as a power and logarithm function of the monthly average temperature and precipitation respectively. The desert had an insignificant growth of NPP during the growing season, while the forest, grassland, and desert steppe had a significant positive-growth in April/June period and then a significant negative-growth in July/October. Interannual NPP showed insignificant change during a five-year period."
Integrating User Needs on Misclassification Error Sensitivity into Image Segmentation Quality Assessment,"Costa, Hugo; Foody, Giles M.; Boyd, Doreen S.",pp. 451-459(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2015/00000081/00000006/art00012;jsessionid=psiit81h0bu4.x-ic-live-03,"Commonly the assessment of the quality of image segmentations used in object-based land cover classification uses the geometric match between the derived segmentation and a reference dataset. This paper argues that a more appropriate assessment of a segmentation is to also consider the thematic content of the objects generated. This allows the assessment to be tailored to the needs of the specific user. A new method for image segmentation quality assessment is described, which combines a traditional geometric-only method with the thematic similarity index (TSI), a metric that expresses the degree of thematic quality of objects from a user's perspective. The perspectives of two users (a wolf researcher and a general user of land cover information) were adopted in a case study to demonstrate the new method. The results show that the new method allowed the production of more accurate land cover classifications for the two users than the use of the geometric-only approach."
Multi-scale Segmentation of High-Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Images Using Adaptively Increased Scale Parameter,"Zhang, Xueliang; Feng, Xuezhi; Xiao, Pengfeng",pp. 461-470(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2015/00000081/00000006/art00015;jsessionid=psiit81h0bu4.x-ic-live-03,"The adaptively increased scale parameter (AISP) strategy is proposed to control multi-scale segmentation based on region growing methods. AISP strategy contains a set of gradually increased scale parameters to produce nested multi-scale segments. Instead of independently assigning the set of scale parameters ahead of segmentation, the contribution of this study is to dynamically determine scale parameters during segmentation procedure, making scale parameters adaptive to specific images and cover meaningful segmentation scales. Furthermore, the effectiveness of gradually increased scale parameters on segmentation accuracy is analyzed, which gives a thorough understanding to local-oriented region growing methods. The experimental results on a set of high-resolution images proved the effectiveness of AISP on controlling multi-scale segmentation. AISP holds the application potential for object-based analysis of high-resolution images."
Mangrove Tree Crown Delineation from High-Resolution Imagery,"Heenkenda, Muditha K.; Joyce, Karen E.; Maier, Stefan W.",pp. 471-479(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2015/00000081/00000006/art00016;jsessionid=psiit81h0bu4.x-ic-live-03,"Mangroves are very dense, spatially heterogeneous, and have limited height variations between neighboring trees. Delineating individual tree crowns is thus very challenging. This study compared methods for isolating mangrove crowns using object based image analysis. A combination of WorldView-2 imagery, a digital surface model, a local maximum filtering technique, and a region growing approach achieved 92 percent overall accuracy in extracting tree crowns. The more traditionally used inverse watershed segmentation method showed low accuracy (35 percent), demonstrating that this method is better suited to homogeneous forests with reasonable height variations between trees. The main challenges with each of the methods tested were the limited height variation between surrounding trees and multiple upward pointing branches of trees. In summary, mangrove tree crowns can be delineated from appropriately parameterized object-based algorithms with a combination of high-resolution satellite images and a digital surface model. We recommend partitioning the imagery into homogeneous species stands for best results."

An object-based classification methodology was developed that employs advanced scale-space filtering, unsupervised clustering, and knowledge-based classification. The developed framework effectively integrates prior vector data and multispectral observations, through incorporating the prior knowledge into the training process and defining the proper object-based classification rules. The methodology successfully identified important building changes, which were validated by employing the vector information of a building geodatabase and a QuickBird image acquired in 2003 and 2007, respectively, over urban regions in the city of Thessaloniki, Greece. The performed quantitative and qualitative evaluation indicated that the proposed analysis framework can detect the new buildings with high accuracy rates and, to a lesser degree, their exact shape and size."

An enhanced version of the Web Ontology Language 2 (OWL2) with fuzzy representations was adopted and expanded to represent fuzzy spatial relationships within the framework of GEOBIA . Segmentation results are stored within PostgreSQL. An ontology described the class/subclass hierarchy and class definitions. SPOR integrated PostgreSQL and the ontology, to classify the objects. To demonstrate the framework, a QuickBird image was employed for building extraction. Accuracy assessment indicated that 87 percent of building rooftops were detected."

The purpose of this study was to assess the spatial distribution of wildfire risk in Lebanon. The objectives were to identify and map (a) wildfire hazard, (b)wildfire vulnerability, and (c) wildfire risk. We developed a model using geospatial biophysical and climatic data and Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA). Development of the wildfire hazard map included classification of forest fuel type, combustibility, and fire spread whereas the vulnerability map included classification of demographic vulnerability (i.e., boundary, occupation and scatter indicators) and forest vulnerability (i.e., environmental and replacement values). The resulting geospatial map of wildfire risk provided important information for potential use in fire risk management."

Our objective was to test the transferability of an object-based rule set for the extraction of glacial cirques, using lidar data and color-infrared orthophotos. In Vorarlberg (W-Austria), we selected one training area with well-developed cirque components to parameterize segmentation and classification criteria. The rule set was applied to three test areas that are positioned in three altitudinal zones. Results indicate that the rule set was successful (81 percent) in the training area and a higher situated area (71 percent). Accuracy decreased in the two lower situated test areas (66 percent and 51 percent). We conclude that rule sets are transferable to areas with a comparable geomorphological history. Yet, significant deviation from the training area requires a different extraction strategy."

Typical geospatial evaluation of urban hydrology begins with identification of water flow and watershed boundaries. This study identifies steps to delineate a highly urbanized watershed in Fairfax County, Virginia. Using standard techniques for natural watersheds and one-meter2 resolution lidar, watershed and flow accumulation raster datasets were derived. Then, modifications encountered within urban landscapes i.e., impervious surfaces, stormwater inlets, pipes, and retention ponds along with high-resolution aerial photos and lidar-derived contour lines were integrated into the analysis. Regions redirecting water flow from stream channels and areas redirecting water flow into the stream channels were identified. These areas were removed or added, reducing the area by almost 17 percent, and the watershed boundary was significantly altered. This analysis illustrates the significance of the distinctive characteristics of the urban landscape in accurate delineations of urban watersheds."
Parallel Performance of Typical Algorithms in Remote Sensing-based Mapping on a Multi-Core Computer,"Yang, Jinghui; Zhang, Jixian",pp. 373-385(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2015/00000081/00000005/art00012;jsessionid=5knnj196818ou.x-ic-live-02,"Typical algorithms in remote sensing-based mapping, such as geometric correction, image fusion, image mosaic, and automatic DEM extractions, are data- and computation-intensive; processing on multi-core computers can improve their performance. Therefore, parallel computing methods that can fully leverage state-of-the-art hardware platforms and that can be easily adapted to these algorithms are required. In this paper, a method with high parallelism is adopted. The method integrates a recursive procedure with a parallel mechanism that is capable of concurrently processing multiple blocks on multiple cores. The parallel experiments of five categories of typical algorithms on two multi-core computers with Windows and Linux operating systems, respectively, were fulfilled. The experimental results show that although the gains of parallel performance vary for different algorithms, the processing performance achieved on multi-core computers is significantly improved. The best case on a computer with two CPUs is able to perform the DEM extractions up to 13.6 times faster than serial execution. According to these experiments, the factors influencing parallel performance on a multi-core computer are discussed."

Availability of higher-resolution DEMs created from light detection and ranging (lidar) data is increasing but their suitability for such applications has received little critical evaluation. Two different 1 m DEMs were re-sampled to 3, 5, and 10 m resolutions and used with and without a low-pass smoothing filter to delineate catchment boundaries and calculate topographic metrics. Accuracy was assessed through comparison with field slope measurements and total station surveys. DEMs provided a good estimate of slope values when grid resolution reflected the field measurement scale. Intermediate scale DEMs were most consistent with land survey techniques in delineating catchment boundaries. Upslope accumulated area was most sensitive to grid resolution, with intermediate resolutions producing a range of UAA values useful in soil and groundwater analysis."

This study employs this knowledge on HSR image segmentation by embedding a straight-line constraint in region-based image segmentation. A new concept called collinear and ipsilateral neighborhood is proposed and applied to hard-boundary constraint-based image segmentation for accuracy improvement. In the experimental areas, the method accuracy measured by recall ratio r increases from 0.036 to 0.048 (on the average) after the refinement, with significantly smaller decreases in precision p that are all less than 0.006. In sum, the proposed technique effectively reduces over-segmentation errors and maintains the same level of under-segmentation error ratio, particularly in man-made areas. It facilitates subsequent object-based image analyses, including feature extraction, object recognition, and classification."

Iterative computation tools were utilized to process the data along with the lidar-derived bare earth digital elevation models and digital surface models to create canopy height models for the Tennessee portion of the park. A height threshold of 51.8 meters was chosen as the minimum value for a tree of extraordinary height. Ten potential sites containing tall trees were identified using this methodology, and seven of the top ten ranking trees' heights were field measured using accepted forestry methodology. The trees detected using these methods are potentially the tallest trees ever measured on the East Coast of the United States. These methods show that unique tall trees can be successfully detected in a large, heterogeneous forest area using lidar data."

These two factors together have led to the increasing use of these platforms and sensors for remote sensing applications with new potential. Thus, the overall goal of this paper is to provide a panoramic overview about the current status of remote sensing applications based on unmanned aerial platforms equipped with a set of specific sensors and instruments. First, some examples of typical platforms used in remote sensing are provided. Second, a description of sensors and technologies is explored which are onboard instruments specifically intended to capture data for remote sensing applications. Third, multi-UAVs in collaboration, coordination, and cooperation in remote sensing are considered. Finally, a collection of applications in several areas are proposed, where the combination of unmanned platforms and sensors, together with methods, algorithms, and procedures provide the overview in very different remote sensing applications. This paper presents an overview of different areas, each independent from the others, so that the reader does not need to read the full paper when a specific application is of interest."

Using a feature selection technique (the instability index), four spectral regions were identified as important for canopy type discrimination, including one red (645-693 nm), one near infrared (735-946 nm), and two shortwave infrared regions (1,960-2,090 nm and 2,400-2,478 nm). The random forests decision tree algorithm was used to compare classification performances of full-range and feature-selected hyperspectral spectra as well as simulated WorldView-2 spectra. Classification results indicated that the process of feature selection can reduce data redundancy and computation time while improving accuracy of tamarisk canopy type classification."

The first two are based on projective transformation and DLT coefficients through which the position of the perspective center is derived first using four or more planar and six or more non-planar object points, respectively. The rotation matrix is then directly estimated using quaternions. The third one (quaternion-based general approach) can handle three or more points in either planar or non-planar configuration. In this approach, the rotation angles are iteratively estimated first using quaternions without the need for user-defined approximations. Then, the position of the perspective center is directly derived. Experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed approaches and the high accuracy of the quaternion-based general approach, which is superior to the state-of-the-art non-iterative method and does not deviate more than 1 percent from the traditional non-linear SPR, i.e., the de-facto standard for the most accurate SPR solution."

First, we discuss the geometric modeling of the asymmetric photogrammetric configuration and analyze the accuracy of measurement based on error propagation for different baseline lengths, different focal lengths, and different pan angles of the PTZ camera. Second, we performed a comprehensive accuracy analysis based on Monte Carlo simulation, which incorporated artificial noise into the input data. Third, we conducted actual experiments in indoor and outdoor environments to verify the theoretical and simulation results. We found that the baseline length between the dual cameras was the main factor influencing measurement accuracy. Increase of the PTZ camera focal length could improve the measurement accuracy, but this trend was not significant when its focal length was relatively long. The pan angle of the PTZ camera also influenced the measurement accuracy, but this influence was not significant at short ranges. From these discoveries, we present an optimum configuration of the dual camera system for better than 1 percent measurement accuracy of the range within a normal observation range (e.g., 60 m). This proposed dual camera system provides enhanced machine vision capabilities that can be used in various applications."

An iterative thresholding procedure to minimize within-class variance was used for bilevel segmentation. The approach was tested in an irrigation district of south-eastern Australia in 2012/2013 crop year. The overall accuracy of identifying farms with irrigated crops amounted to 88.4 percent.

To prevent future risk posed by such events, effective methods to detect and map their hazards are needed. Traditional landslide susceptibility mapping techniques, based on field inspection, aerial photograph interpretation, and contour map analysis are often subjective, tedious, difficult to implement, and may not have the spatial resolution and temporal frequency necessary to map small slides, which is the focus of this investigation. We present a methodology that is based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) that utilizes a lidar-derived Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to quantify and map the topographic signatures of landslides. The algorithm employs several geomorphological features to calibrate the model and delineate between landslide and stable terrain. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, a road corridor in Zanesville, Ohio, was used for testing. The resulting landslide susceptibility map was validated to correctly identify 67 of the 80 mapped landslides in the independently compiled landslide inventory map of the area. These results suggest that the proposed landslide surface feature extraction method and airborne lidar data can be used as efficient tools for small landslide susceptibility and hazard mapping."
Direct Linear Transformation from Comparator Coordinates into Object Space Coordinates in Close-Range Photogrammetry,"Abdel-Aziz, Y.I.; Karara, H.M.",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2015/00000081/00000002/art00001;jsessionid=1k17bzchbiiwa.x-ic-live-03,"A method for photogrammetric data reduction without the necessity for neither fiducial marks nor initial approximations for inner and outer orientation parameters of the camera has been developed.

Preliminary fictitious data tests indicate that the approach is promising. Experiments with real data are underway."
Fully Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Processing for Crop Type Identification,"Hong, Gang; Wang, Shusen; Li, Junhua; Huang, Jingfeng",pp. 109-117(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2015/00000081/00000002/art00002;jsessionid=1k17bzchbiiwa.x-ic-live-03,"The target or polarimetric decomposition is widely used to process multi-polarization SAR imagery to establish a correspondence between physical characteristics of interested objects and observed scattering mechanisms. Polarimetric decomposition parameters are used as the basis for developing new classification methods for analyzing polarimetric SAR data. This study proposes to combine two polarimetric decomposition parameters (entropy (H) and angle (α)) derived from the Cloude and Pottier decomposition method and total scattered power (Span) in crop type identification. Support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithm was selected as a classifier to resolve limitations of classifications based on polarimetric decomposition parameters. The advantages of the proposed method are determined by comparing with other commonly used methods based on polarimetric features and the results produced from the coherency matrix, i.e., without target decomposition. Results show that the proposed method is about 10 percent better than other methods based on polarimetric features without Span, and it outperforms the result from the coherency matrix with about 4 percent improvement in the overall accuracy."
An Improved Liberal Cloud-Mask for Addressing Snow/Cloud Confusion with MODIS,"Paull, David J.; Lees, Brian G.; Thompson, Jeffery A.",pp. 119-129(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2015/00000081/00000002/art00003;jsessionid=1k17bzchbiiwa.x-ic-live-03,"The utility of the daily MODIS snow products depends on the ability of the MODIS cloud-masking algorithm to differentiate between snow- and cloud-cover. Although few studies have explored the issue, snow/cloud confusion is a key issue limiting the accuracy of the MODIS snow products. Recent studies from the Southern Hemisphere suggested that snow/cloud confusion limited the utility of the MODIS snow products there. In this study, MODIS snow/cloud confusion over Australia was investigated using an improved liberal cloud-mask in conjunction with a snow-detection algorithm. The performance of the proposed cloud-mask was assessed using high-resolution ASTER imagery and in situ observations. Results indicated that the improved liberal cloud-masking algorithm reduced snow/ cloud confusion, successfully identifying snow-covered pixels that were previously identified as cloudy. The analysis further suggested that scale-related differences in imagery used in the standard MODIS cloud-masking workflow might be the source of some snow/cloud confusion previously reported."
Validation of Geometric Accuracy of Global Land Survey (GLS) 2000 Data,"Rengarajan, Rajagopalan; Sampath, Aparajithan; Storey, James; Choate, Michael",pp. 131-141(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2015/00000081/00000002/art00004;jsessionid=1k17bzchbiiwa.x-ic-live-03,"The Global Land Survey (GLS) 2000 data were generated from Geocover™ 2000 data with the aim of producing a global data set of accuracy better than 25 m Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). An assessment and validation of accuracy of GLS 2000 data set, and its co-registration with Geocover™ 2000 data set is presented here. Since the availability of global data sets that have higher nominal accuracy than the GLS 2000 is a concern, the data sets were assessed in three tiers. In the first tier, the data were compared with the Geocover™ 2000 data. This comparison provided a means of localizing regions of higher differences. In the second tier, the GLS 2000 data were compared with systematically corrected Landsat-7 scenes that were obtained in a time period when the spacecraft pointing information was extremely accurate. These comparisons localize regions where the data are consistently off, which may indicate regions of higher errors. The third tier consisted of comparing the GLS 2000 data against higher accuracy reference data. The reference data were the Digital Ortho Quads over the United States, orthorectified SPOT data over Australia, and high accuracy check points obtained using triangulation bundle adjustment of Landsat-7 images over selected sites around the world. The study reveals that the geometric errors in Geocover™ 2000 data have been rectified in GLS 2000 data, and that the accuracy of GLS 2000 data can be expected to be better than 25 m RMSE for most of its constituent scenes."
Vegetation Burn Severity Mapping Using Landsat-8 and WorldView-2,"Wu, Zhuoting; Middleton, Barry; Hetzler, Robert; Vogel, John; Dye, Dennis",pp. 143-154(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2015/00000081/00000002/art00005;jsessionid=1k17bzchbiiwa.x-ic-live-03,"We used remotely sensed data from the Landsat-8 and WorldView-2 satellites to estimate vegetation burn severity of the Creek Fire on the San Carlos Apache Reservation, where wildfire occurrences affect the Tribe's crucial livestock and logging industries. Accurate pre- and post-fire canopy maps at high (0.5-meter) resolution were created from World- View-2 data to generate canopy loss maps, and multiple indices from pre- and post-fire Landsat-8 images were used to evaluate vegetation burn severity. Normalized difference vegetation index based vegetation burn severity map had the highest correlation coefficients with canopy loss map from WorldView-2. Two distinct approaches - canopy loss mapping from WorldView-2 and spectral index differencing from Landsat-8 - agreed well with the field-based burn severity estimates and are both effective for vegetation burn severity mapping. Canopy loss maps created with WorldView-2 imagery add to a short list of accurate vegetation burn severity mapping techniques that can help guide effective management of forest resources on the San Carlos Apache Reservation, and the broader fire-prone regions of the Southwest."
Estimating The Population Distribution in a County Area in China Based on Impervious Surfaces,"Zhu, Honglei; Li, Ying; Liu, Zhaoli; Fu, Bolin",pp. 155-163(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2015/00000081/00000002/art00006;jsessionid=1k17bzchbiiwa.x-ic-live-03,"Information on the county level population distribution is essential for supporting a wide variety of local planning processes. Previous researchers found that impervious surfaces had a strong linear relationship with population. But few studies have reported estimating population in a county area of China with impervious surfaces. In this paper, a population distribution model for a county area in China was established using demographic information at the county level (i.e., total population, non-agricultural population, and agricultural population) and impervious surfaces derived from Land-sat TM images. The model was conducted to distribute the population of Fujin County, Heilongjiang Province, China. Population data of 123 villages and 11 towns of Fujin County were used to evaluate the model. The results indicated that the model performs better than area-based approaches, particularly in the estimation of town populations (17.86 percent mean relative error). The results of village population estimation were acceptable, with a mean relative error of 25.3 percent. As a result, impervious surfaces cannot provide height information and identify non-residential areas in developed areas of zhens (urban cores of towns). The model suggests the difficulty of non-agricultural population estimation."
Correction of Distortions in YG-12 High-Resolution Panchromatic Images,"Jiang, Yonghua; Zhang, Guo; Li, Deren; Tang, Xinming; Huang, Wenchao; Li, Litao",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2015/00000081/00000001/art00001;jsessionid=btjm6co5tc34o.x-ic-live-02,"Design deficiencies and hardware limitations cause a number of issues with the images acquired by Chinese satellites launched before 2012, such as YG-12. The geometric quality of the images recorded by YG-12 cannot match its high resolution because of serious time-synchronization errors and interior distortions. To improve the geometric quality of YG-12 images, this paper proposes a method of interior calibration for the YG-12 panchromatic sensor. In addition, an innovative method is proposed to eliminate time-synchronization errors using parallel observations of the panchromatic sensor onboard YG-12. The experimental results indicate the interior parameters of the panchromatic sensor are determined with an accuracy of better than 0.32 pixels, and seamless mosaic images can be obtained after the elimination of distortions. Furthermore, the positioning accuracy with relatively few ground control points is shown to be better than 1.5 pixels."
Optimal Land Cover Mapping and Change Analysis in Northeastern Oregon Using Landsat Imagery,"Campbell, Michael; Congalton, Russell G.; Hartter, Joel; Ducey, Mark",pp. 37-47(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2015/00000081/00000001/art00002;jsessionid=btjm6co5tc34o.x-ic-live-02,"The necessity for the development of repeatable, efficient, and accurate monitoring of land cover change is paramount to successful management of our planet’s natural resources. This study evaluated a number of remote sensing methods for classifying land cover and land cover change throughout a two-county area in northeastern Oregon (1986 to 2011). In the past three decades, this region has seen significant changes in forest management that have affected land use and land cover. This study employed an accuracy assessment-based empirical approach to test the optimality of a number of advanced digital image processing techniques that have recently emerged in the field of remote sensing. The accuracies are assessed using traditional error matrices, calculated using reference data obtained in the field. We found that, for single-time land cover classification, Bayes pixel-based classification using samples created with scale and shape segmentation parameters of 8 and 0.3, respectively, resulted in the highest overall accuracy. For land cover change detection, using Landsat-5 TM band 7 with a change threshold of 1.75 standard deviations resulted in the highest accuracy for forest harvesting and regeneration mapping."

Three spatial constraints are incorporated to filter possible outliers, including a cyclic angular ordering constraint, a local position constraint, and a neighborhood conserving constraint. Other ancillary geometric information, which includes the initial exterior orientation parameters that are obtained from the platform parameters and a rough DEM, are used to transform the oblique images geometrically and reduce the perspective deformations. Experiment results revealed that the proposed method is superior to the standard SIFT regarding both precision and correct matches using images obtained by the SWDC-5 system."

Our proposed land cover updating method involves the use of coarse-resolution images to update fine-resolution land cover maps. The method comprises change detection and sub-pixel mapping methods. The current coarse-resolution image is unmixed, and the previous fine-resolution map is spatially degraded to produce current and previous class fraction images. A change detection method is applied to these fraction images to create a fine-resolution binary change/non-change map. Finally, a sub-pixel mapping method is applied to update the fine-resolution pixel labels that are changed in the change/non-change map. The proposed method is compared with a pixel-based classification method and two sub-pixel mapping methods. The proposed method maintains most of the spatial patterns of land cover classes that are unchanged in the previous and current images, whereas other methods cannot."

In this paper, we are developing an innovative wetland and invasive plant mapping technique characterized with three integrations: the integration of image interpretation with feature extraction, the integration of high spatial-resolution images with high spectral-solution images, and the integration of field reference data with interpreted and classified images. This technique advocates standard procedures for integrating NAIP (National Agriculture Imagery Program) and Landsat images with multiple processes of ground truthing, image classification, and validation. The case study conducted in the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge concludes that the integration of NAIP and Landsat images provides sufficient spatial and spectral information for mapping coastal wetlands and Phragmites."

SAR backprojection has been found to improve the focusing of low-altitude stripmap SAR images compared to frequency domain algorithms. In this paper we describe the development and implementation of SAR backprojection appropriate for UAS based stripmap SAR that utilizes the unique architecture of a GPU in order to produce high-quality imagery in real-time."

The algorithm automatically establishes correspondence between the First-Person View (FPV) video streamed from a UAS flying in an urban environment and its 3D building model. The resulting camera pose provides a precise navigation solution in the densely structured environment. Initially, Vertical Line Features are extracted from the FPV video frames, as the forward and downward-looking camera is kept stabilized through a gimbal camera mount. Geometric hashing is then used to match the extracted image features with a database of Vertical Line Features extracted from synthetic images of the 3D building models. The exterior orientation parameters of the FPV video frames for localizing the UAS frames are determined by photogrammetric bundle adjustment. The results demonstrate that sub-meter accuracies in the UAS's X, Y, Z positional coordinates are achievable from flying 40 m above ground."

However, they provide limited coverage owing to their low altitudes and short endurance. Therefore, a quick and effective surveillance necessitates optimal flying paths, maximizing ground visibility. Even though the occlusion of ground points due to vegetation is significant in forests, it is generally neglected. This paper proposes a probabilistic sensing model that incorporates both occlusions due to terrain and vegetation, in the visibility computations and presents a two-step approach to determine near-optimal flight paths: (a) waypoints are strategically deployed to enhance visibility, using centroidal Voronoi tessellation, and (b) flyable paths are designed using a clustered spiral-alternating algorithm. Simulation studies conducted on synthetic terrains and a reconstructed terrain, from satellite data of tree-cover and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), show the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving the terrain visibility as compared to commonly used grid-based waypoints."

AggieAir, a new unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform, is flown autonomously using pre-programmed flight plans at low altitudes to limit atmospheric effects. The UAV acquires high-resolution, multispectral images and has a flight interval of about 30 minutes. The sensors on board are twin cameras with duplicate settings and automatic mode disabled. A white Barium Sulfate (BaSO4) panel is used for reflectance calibration and in situ irradiance measurements. The spatial and radiometric resolution of the imagery is 25 cm and 8-bit, respectively. The raw images are mosaicked and orthorectified and the model converts their digital numbers (DN) to reflectance values. Imagery, acquired around local solar noon over wetlands on the Great Salt Lake, Utah, is used to illustrate the results. The model generates high quality images and the results are good. The reflectance values of vegetation in the NIR, Green and Red bands extracted at the test locations are consistent. The image processing, reflectance calculations, accuracy issues, with the proposed method are discussed."

Results show that NDVI values computed from sUAS imagery explained up to 94 percent of the variance (p<0.01) in AGB measurements. The model coefficient of determination (r2) decreased with increasing aircraft flight altitude suggesting image spatial resolution is a key factor influencing the strength of the relationship. A scaling-up approach from small-scale sUAS imagery to broad-scale, digital aerial imagery collected at 1,200 meters by a piloted aircraft was used to provide AGB model estimates across the entire 4,500 ha of the Preserve. Spectral reflectance data measured by spectroradiometer were also used to identify three optimal regions of the spectrum that have the highest significant correlations with tallgrass AGB."

The main contribution here is introducing a new matching strategy that uses an association matrix to store information about candidate matches of linear features. The motivation for this work is aiding the 3D modeling of industrial sites rich with pole-like features. The proposed matching strategy aims at establishing hypotheses about potential minimal matches of linear features that could be used for the estimation of the transformation parameters relating the scans; then, quantifying the agreement between the scans using the estimated transformation parameters. We combine the association matrix and the well-known RANSAC approach for the derivation of conjugate pairs among the two scans. Rather than randomly selecting the line pairs as in the RANSAC-based registration, the association matrix guides the process of selecting the candidate matches of linear features. Experiments are conducted using laser scanning data of an electrical substation to assess the performance of the proposed association-matrix-based sample consensus approach as it compares to the traditional RANSAC-based procedure. The association-matrix-based approach showed consistent tendency of bringing up the correct matches first before the RANSAC-based registration."

First, we propose a strategy for prior probability determination in terms of the statistical characteristics of a deterministic mathematical model for hypothesis testing. Moreover, the inlier probability updating is simplified based on a memorable form of Bayes' Theorem. The proposed approach is validated on a variety of image pairs. The results indicate that when compared with the performance of RANdom SAmpling Consensus (RANSAC) and the original BaySAC, the proposed optimized BaySAC consumes less computation and obtains higher matching accuracy when the hypothesis set is contaminated with more outliers."

An extensive accuracy assessment was carried out for three semiautomatic feature extraction approaches for extracting 36 lake features on Larsemann Hills, Antarctica. The method was tested on five existing PAN-sharpening algorithms, which suggest that the customized NDWI approach renders intermediate performance (root mean square error varies from ε227 to ε235 m2) and highest stability when compared with existing feature extraction techniques. In general, the customized NDWI rendered a least misclassification (≈11 percent), followed by target detection (≈16 percent) and spectral processing (≈17 percent) methods for extraction of 36 lakes. We also found that customized NDWI caused consistently least misclassification (≈21 percent) than the target detection (≈23 percent) and spectral processing (≈30 percent) methods for extraction of partially snow or ice-covered 11 lakes. Our results indicate that the use of the customized NDWI approach and appropriate PAN-sharpening algorithm can greatly improve the semiautomatic extraction of lake features in cryospheric environment."

In this study in coastal forests of British Columbia, the main objective was to determine the potential of Landsat imagery to accurately estimate forest canopy cover measured from small-footprint airborne lidar data in order to expand the lidar measurements to a larger area. Landsat-derived Tasseled Cap Angle (TCA) and spectral mixture analysis (SMA) endmember fractions (i.e., sunlit canopy, non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), shade and exposed soil) were compared to lidar-derived canopy cover estimates. Pixel-based analysis and object-based area-weighted error calculations were used to assess regression model performance. The best canopy cover estimate was obtained (in the object-based deciduous forest models) with a mean object size (MOS) of 2.5 hectares (adjusted R2= 0.86 and RMSE = 0.28). Overall, lower canopy cover estimation accuracy was obtained for coniferous forests compared to deciduous forests in both the pixel and object-based approaches."
Object-Based Hyperspectral Classification of Urban Areas by Using Marker-Based Hierarchical Segmentation,"Akbari, Davood; Abdolreza, Safari; Saeid, Homayouni",pp. 963-970(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2014/00000080/00000010/art00003;jsessionid=1er9w07oadbmp.x-ic-live-02,"An effective approach to spectral-spatial classification has been achieved using Hierarchical SEGmentation (HSEG) by Tarabalka et al. (2009 and 2010). Our goal is to improve this approach to the classification of hyperspectral images in urban areas. The first step of our proposed method is to segment the spectral images using a novel marker-based HSEG method. The spatial features from segmented images are then extracted. Spatial information such as the area, entropy, shape, adjacency, and relation features constitute the components of feature space. Last, using both spectral and spatial features, the image objects are classified by a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Three image datasets were used to test this method. The results of our experiment indicate that the main advantage of the proposed method, compared to the previous HSEG-based approach, is that it increases classification accuracy by selecting the appropriate contextual features of different objects."

Aiming at automatically separating smoke plumes from other cover types, several bands of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra/Aqua satellites were selected. A smoke identification algorithm that integrates K-means clustering and Fisher Linear Discrimination was developed. It’s evaluated that the algorithm can identify more than 98 percent of the smoke pixels by using the k-folds cross-validation technique. Then, the algorithm was validated in: (a) Daxing'anling area (China) on 29 April 2009, (b) Amur Region (Russia) on 29 April 2009, (c) Australia on 30 September 2011, and (d) Canada on 19 June 2013, in which several fires occurred. By comparing the results with the grayscale images, it can be seen that the algorithm has the capability to capture heavy smoke as well as part of dispersed smoke. The results suggest that the proposed algorithm can be used as an innovative tool for detecting forest fire smoke."
Examining Change Detection Approaches for Tropical Mangrove Monitoring,"Myint, Soe W.; Franklin, Janet; Buenemann, Michaela; Kim, Won K.; Giri, Chandra P.",pp. 983-993(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2014/00000080/00000010/art00005;jsessionid=1er9w07oadbmp.x-ic-live-02,"This study evaluated the effectiveness of different band combinations and classifiers (unsupervised, supervised, object-oriented nearest neighbor, and object-oriented decision rule) for quantifying mangrove forest change using multitemporal Landsat data. A discriminant analysis using spectra of different vegetation types determined that bands 2 (0.52 to 0.6 μm), 5 (1.55 to 1.75 μm), and 7 (2.08 to 2.35 μm) were the most effective bands for differentiating mangrove forests from surrounding land cover types. A ranking of thirty-six change maps, produced by comparing the classification accuracy of twelve change detection approaches, was used. The object-based Nearest Neighbor classifier produced the highest mean overall accuracy (84 percent) regardless of band combinations. The automated decision rule-based approach (mean overall accuracy of 88 percent) as well as a composite of bands 2, 5, and 7 used with the unsupervised classifier and the same composite or all band difference with the object-oriented Nearest Neighbor classifier were the most effective approaches."
Generation of Pixel-Level SAR Image Time Series Using a Locally Adaptive Matching Technique,"Cheng, Liang; Wang, Yafei; Li, Manchun; Zhong, Lishan; Wang, Jiechen",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2014/00000080/00000009/art00001;jsessionid=16n4af678wgiw.x-ic-live-02,"Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image time series play an important role in many applications. To construct pixel-level SAR image time series, we propose a locally adaptive image matching technique for the high-precision geometric registration of SAR images. The basic idea is to adapt the local characteristics of ground objects during the process of image registration. Then, by analyzing the spatial distribution of the error of each matched pair in the previous iteration, local areas are divided based on the local clustering of pairs with large errors. A new polynomial is then used to satisfy the local geometric constraint. Based on this proposed matching technique, we introduce a pixel-level SAR image time series modeling method. The experimental results show that the average geometric error of corresponding pixels in this algorithm is 0.073 pixels, while that of the NEST software is 0.242 pixels. The Pearson correlation coefficients of 20 pixels’ time series are above 0.85, indicating that the series bears high curve similarity and geometric precision, which suggests the proposed technique can provide high-quality SAR image time series."

Selecting Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE) as the test method, this paper studies the effects of distance metric selection inLEand proposes a spectral-angle-based LE method (LE-SA) to be compared against the traditional LE-based on Euclidean distance (LE-ED). LE-SA and LE-ED were applied to two airborne hyperspectral data sets and the dimensionality-reduced data were quantitatively evaluated. Experimental results demonstrated that LE-SA is able to suppress the variations within the same type of features, such as variations in vegetation and those in illuminations due to shade or orientations, and maintain a higher level of overall separability among different features than LE-ED. Further, the potential usage of a single LE-SA or LE-ED band for target detection is discussed."
Generating Pit-free Canopy Height Models from Airborne Lidar,"Khosravipour, Anahita; Skidmore, Andrew K.; Isenburg, Martin; Wang, Tiejun; Hussin, Yousif A.",pp. 863-872(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2014/00000080/00000009/art00003;jsessionid=16n4af678wgiw.x-ic-live-02,"Canopy height models (CHMs) derived from lidar data have been applied to extract forest inventory parameters. However, variations in modeled height cause data pits, which form a challenging problem as they disrupt CHM smoothness, negatively affecting tree detection and subsequent biophysical measurements. These pits appear where laser beams penetrate deeply into a tree crown, hitting a lower branch or the ground before producing the first return. In this study, we develop a new algorithm that generates a pit-free CHM raster, by using subsets of the lidar points to close pits. The algorithm operates robustly on high-density lidar data as well as on a thinned lidar dataset. The evaluation involves detecting individual trees using the pit-free CHM and comparing the findings to those achieved by using a Gaussian smoothed CHM. The results show that our pit-freeCHMsderived from high-and low-density lidar data significantly improve the accuracy of tree detection."
A Hierarchical Building Detection Method for Very High Resolution Remotely Sensed Images Combined with DSM Using Graph Cut Optimization,"Qin, Rongjun; Fang, Wei",pp. 873-883(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2014/00000080/00000009/art00004;jsessionid=16n4af678wgiw.x-ic-live-02,"Detecting buildings in remotely sensed data plays an important role for urban analysis and geographical information systems. This study proposes a hierarchical approach for extracting buildings from very high resolution (9 cm GSD (Ground Sampling Distance)), multi-spectral aerial images and matched DSMs (Digital Surface Models). There are three steps in the proposed method: first, shadows are detected with a morphological index, and corrected for NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) computation; second, the NDVI is incorporated using a top-hat reconstruction of the DSM to obtain the initial building mask; finally, a graph cut optimization based on modified superpixel segmentation is carried out to consolidate building segments with high probability and thus eliminates segments that have low probability to be buildings. Experiments were performed over the whole Vaihingen dataset, covering 3.4 km2with around 3000 buildings. The proposed algorithm effectively extracted 94 percent of the buildings with 87 percent correctness. This demonstrates that the proposed method achieved satisfactory results over a large dataset and has the potential for many practical applications."

A total of 1,885 field plots (30 × 30 m) were established across a 8,715 km2study area in spring of 2012, an exceptionally dry year. Average target canopy cover (7.5 percent) and biomass (0.82 g/m2) were extremely low. The WV2 MTMF classification had a much greater overall accuracy of 88 percent, while the resampled WV2 and the Landsat ETM+ MTMF classification overall accuracies were 67 percent and 59 percent, respectively. Producer’s and user’s accuracies in target detection were 86 percent and 94 percent, respectively, although the exceptionally low canopy cover and biomass were not well correlated with image-based estimates."

Reliable reference maps make this monitoring more effective. A very high resolution and reliable vegetation map with a nominal spatial resolution of 2 cm by 2 cm was created for a study area in the high moor in the Kushiro wetland, Japan. The reference map was created using aerial photography recorded in the summer of 1998 with a 35 mm, non-metric camera mounted on a balloon. The study site contains 40 wetland plant community types covering about 10 ha of the high moor. The resulting map shows that belt-like spatial patterns of typical wetland plant community groups can be clearly distinguished and confirmed through visual interpretation and spatial pattern analysis. The optimal spatial resolution for monitoring vegetation in this area using remote sensing is 0.3 m or smaller."

They are widespread in horticultural cultivation as ornamental trees and planted in gardens and parks around the world. Economically speaking, the Stone Pine is very important for the agriculture sector, for tourism, and for the health sector. In this research, a pilot area located in Mount Lebanon is compared for changes in the Stone Pine cover between the years of 1962 and 2012. The comparison is based on processing a hyperspectral image provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) and a Landsat ETM+ image as well as topographic maps. Several issues related to the use of CHRIS-Proba hyperspectral images have been investigated and analyzed. The results established that hyperspectral data: (a) is 30 percent or more accurate and efficient when compared with multispectral data, and (b) helps determine precise extent of the Stone Pine cover."

A framework was designed to integrate two remotely sensed datasets and four data processing techniques. Lidar elevation and intensity features were extracted from the original point cloud data to avoid the errors and uncertainties in the raster-based lidar methods. Lidar significantly increased the classification accuracy compared with the application of hyperspectral data alone. Three lidar-derived features (elevation, intensity, and topography) had the same contributions in the classification. A synergy of hyperspectral imagery with all lidar-derived features achieved the best result with an overall accuracy of 86 percent and a Kappa value of 0.82 based on an ensemble analysis of three machine learning classifiers. Ensemble analysis did not significantly increase the classification accuracy, but it provided a complementary uncertainty map for the final classified map. The study shows the promise of the synergy of hyperspectral and lidar systems for mapping complex wetlands."

The observations included airborne observations from hyperspectral optical, thermal, and microwave sensors coinciding with intensive field measurements. The hyperspectral optical and thermal datasets were first analyzed and processed to select the best hyperspectral features to be included in the soil moisture retrieval procedure. A linear model linking the selected hyperspectral features to the microwave observations and the in situ soil moisture is proposed. The application of this model resulted in soil moisture estimates that agree with in situ measurements (correlation coefficient: R >0.76, root mean squared differences: RMSD <0.07 m3m-3). The hyperspectral dataset strengthened the link between optical, thermal and microwave L-band observations with soil moisture, and provided a spatial framework to disaggregate soil moisture at very high spatial resolution (3.5 m), useful in hydrological modeling and precision agriculture."

The spectra and their derivatives are evaluated using three modeling techniques: two-band hyperspectral vegetation indices (HVIs), multiple band-HVIs (MB-HVIs) developed from Sequential Search Methods (SSM), and MB-HVIs developed from Principal Component Regression. Overall, the two-band HVIs and MB-HVIs developed from SSMs using first derivative transformed spectra in the visible blue and green and NIR explained more biomass variability and had lower error than the other approaches or transformations; however a better search criterion needs to be developed in order to reflect the true ability of the two-band HVI approach. Short-Wave Infrared 1 (1000 to 1700 nm) proved less effective, but still important in the final models."

Spectral signatures of pure patches of Teak, Bamboo, and mixed species covers are significantly different across the three seasons indicating distinctive phenology of each cover. Kernel Principal Component Analysis (k-PCA) is more suitable for dimensionality reduction for these covers. The three vegetation covers classified using images of three seasons achieved the best classification accuracies using k-PCA with maximum likelihood classifier for the monsoon season with overall accuracies of 83 to 100 percent for single species, 74 to 81 percent for two species, and 72 percent for three species respectively."

In addition, we propose a multi-correlation matrix strategy which combines multiple correlation matrices from different datasets and uses more information from each matrix.We apply this method to a large multi-temporal spectral library to derive vegetation indices and related regression models for rice biomass detection in the tillering, stem elongation, heading and across all growth stages. The models are calibrated with data from three consecutive years and validated with two other years. The results reveal that the multi-correlation matrix strategy can improve the model performance by 10 to 62 percent, depending on the growth stage."

We propose a statistical method for best estimating the NOC, not only prior to but also independent of the clustering. This method uses both residual analysis (RA) and change point analysis (CPA) to select a number of candidates. Because the NOC and the data intrinsic dimension (ID) interact with one another in a predictable way, ID can provide useful inferential information about the NOC. Indeed, once the ID has been found, the NOC can be inferred on the basis of this information. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by processing several hyperspectral datasets. Furthermore, a comparison with the results of the partitional approach, using some well-known similarity measures, has demonstrated that our method is more effective in detecting the optimal NOC."

Methods are applied to approximately 250 km2 in the intermountain western USA. A robust suite of statistical approaches, which offer an alternative to traditional kappa-based methods, are utilized to determine equivalence between methods and overall effectiveness. Object-oriented approaches have the highest overall accuracy among the assessed methods. Each of the methods varied considerably in cover class accuracy. SWA has the highest class accuracy when juniper canopy cover is low (0 to 40 percent cover), ISODATA performs best at moderate cover (60 to 80 percent) and maximum likelihood performs best at higher cover (60 to 100 percent cover)."

Results indicated monthly water yield was insensitive to DEM resolution, unless a change in area was also present. Sediment yield from the 50 m DEM showed a 200 t reduction compared to the 1 m DEM. The 5 to 50 m DEMs also showed a reduction in channel deposition of 45 to 90 t, respectively, compared to the 1 m DEM.

First, we discuss the difference between single- and dual-sensor stereo geometry and suggest that bisector elevation (BIE) and asymmetry angle, in addition to convergence angle, are important considerations for interpreting dual-sensor stereo geometry. We point out that for single-sensor BIE angles and asymmetry angles are close to ideal values, and their importance has not been highlighted. We show that dual-sensor stereo may produce small BIE angles and large asymmetry angles, and such angles may lead to weak geometry and accuracy degradation of dual-sensor stereo. Second, we compare rigorous sensor models (RSMs) with rational function models (RFMs) for handling dual-sensor stereo. For stable dual-sensor stereo, both models show similar performance. However, for dual-sensor stereo with weak geometry, RSMs produce better positioning accuracies than RFMs."

This paper presents a new method for SAR imaging and interferometry using parameters estimated from raw data. First, methods for determining the order of real and imaginary parts within the raw data images, and for determining chirp rate polarity are proposed. Second, a selection of parameters, including the forward effective velocities of the sensor, the near range distance, and the squint angle, are extracted using the Doppler centroid and Doppler rate. Finally, we create single look complex (SLC) images, coherence maps, digital elevation models (DEMs), and dual-pass differential unwrapped phase maps. The level of accuracy shown in this comparative study suggests that the proposed method is acceptable for creating the featured SAR products and is suitable for real world applications. This method and result is particularly relevant for systems which suffer from a lack of high-accuracy positional metadata."

The resulting classification from the filtered versions of the vegetation indices showed a substantial improvement in accuracy when compared to the classifications from the unfiltered versions. The classification by the EVIsg had the highest K (0.72) for all classes compared to those of the EVI (0.67), NDVI (0.63), and NDVIsg (0.62). Therefore, we conclude that the EVIsg is best suited for land cover classification compared to the other data sets in this study."

Instead of using a high quality test field specifically designed for camera calibration purpose, this study intends to make a use of readily available, public geographic data as the reference. Such public data may include Google Earth™ images, Bing Map images, SRTM DEM, and ASTER GDEM. For comparison purpose, the standard national digital orthophoto maps (DOM) and digital elevation models (DEM) are also utilized. To carry out the calibration, ground control points (GCPs) are selected by matching the satellite images to the reference data. It is shown that the calibration corrects large amounts of systematic errors caused by significant lens distortion and poor direct georeferencing. After calibration, the interior accuracy of the images is improved from a range of six to eight pixels to sub-pixel level, and the direct georeferencing accuracy is increased from 1.8 km to 115 m. The study demonstrates the necessity of camera calibration and the value of public geographic data for this need."
Performance Evaluation of Object-based and Pixel-based Building Detection Algorithms from Very High Spatial Resolution Imagery,"Khosravi, Iman; Momeni, Mehdi; Rahnemoonfar, Maryam",pp. 519-528(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2014/00000080/00000006/art00002;jsessionid=2148pfs7i89b9.x-ic-live-01,"This paper reviews and evaluates four building extraction algorithms including two pixel-based and two object-based methods using a diverse set of very high spatial resolution imagery. The applied images are chosen from different places (the cities of Isfahan, Tehran, and Ankara) and different sensors (QuickBird and GeoEye-1), which are diverse in terms of building shape, size, color, height, alignment, brightness, and density. The results indicate that the performance and the reliability of two object-based algorithms are better than pixel-based algorithms; about 10 percent to 15 percent better for the building detection rate and 6 percent to 10 percent better for the reliability rate. However, in some cases, the detection rate of pixel-based algorithms has been greater than 80 percent, which is a satisfactory result. On the other hand, segmentation errors can cause limitations and errors in the object-based algorithms, so that the commission error of object-based algorithms has been higher than pixel-based algorithms in some cases."
An Effective Morphological Index in Automatic Recognition of Built-up Area Suitable for High Spatial Resolution Images as ALOS and SPOT Data,"Wang, Li; Yu, Bo; Niu, Zheng; Shakir, Muhammad",pp. 529-536(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2014/00000080/00000006/art00003;jsessionid=2148pfs7i89b9.x-ic-live-01,"Building detection from remote sensed images is the main technique to monitor economic or environmental development of an area. Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) and SPOT data are reliable sources due to the limitation of weather, position, time, and other practical reasons. However, to the best of our knowledge, algorithms proposed in the identification of buildings mostly aim only at images with very high spatial resolution or high spectral resolution. There are few algorithms for detecting buildings from ALOS and SPOT data. A built-up detection index (BDI) is proposed in this paper to automatically identify buildings from images with 10 meters resolution. It synthesizes morphological theory and normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) to enhance buildings by suppressing vegetation. Four images of ALOS and SPOT are used to verify the efficiency, stability and accuracy of BDI. Experiments show that BDI is suitable to detect buildings from 10 meters resolution with reliable accuracy."
Annual Crop Type Classification of the US Great Plains for 2000 to 2011,"Howard, Daniel M.; Wylie, Bruce K.",pp. 537-549(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2014/00000080/00000006/art00004;jsessionid=2148pfs7i89b9.x-ic-live-01,"The purpose of this study was to increase the spatial and temporal availability of crop classification data. In this study, nearly 16.2 million crop observation points were used in the training of the US Great Plains classification tree crop type model (CTM). Each observation point was further defined by weekly Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, annual climate, and a number of other biogeophysical environmental characteristics. This study accounted for the most prevalent crop types in the region, including, corn, soybeans, winter wheat, spring wheat, cotton, sorghum, and alfalfa. Annual CTM crop maps of the US Great Plains were created for 2000 to 2011 at a spatial resolution of 250 meters. The CTM achieved an 87 percent classification success rate on 1.8 million observation points that were withheld from model training. Product validation was performed on greater than 15,000 county records with a coefficient of determination of R2= 0.76."
OBIA Flood Delimitation Assisted by Threshold Determination with Principal Component Analysis,"Roque, Dora; Afonso, Nuno; Fonseca, Ana M.; Heleno, Sandra",pp. 551-557(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2014/00000080/00000006/art00005;jsessionid=2148pfs7i89b9.x-ic-live-01,"Accurate and rapidly mapped flood boundaries are extremely important for emergency management operations and hydraulic flood model calibration. This study presents a methodology for automatic flood delimitation in SAR images. An Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA) is applied to SAR images and to a Digital Terrain Model (DTM), organizing a database for hydraulic flood models calibration. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is proposed to automate the determination of flood / non-flood decision thresholds. A previous classification, with a visual threshold selection, is performed for a small set of training images. A first PCA detects correlation between the training thresholds, image, and flood parameters; while a second PCA allows the automatic determination of the threshold for the remaining dataset classification. For the quality assessment, averages of 88 percent for properly detected flooded area and of 10 percent for commission error are achieved. It is verified that the algorithm performs well for images acquired during most weather conditions."
Planar Block Adjustment and Orthorectification of ZY-3 Satellite Images,"Wang, Taoyang; Zhang, Guo; Li, Deren; Tang, Xinming; Jiang, Yonghua; Pan, Hongbo; Zhu, Xiaoyong",pp. 559-570(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2014/00000080/00000006/art00006;jsessionid=2148pfs7i89b9.x-ic-live-01,"For the problem of block adjustment for satellite images, which cannot be solved under conditions of weak geometric convergence, this paper proposes a strategy that uses a planar block adjustment method to solve the orientation parameters of all satellite images, and then each satellite image is orthorectified. This strategy can ensure both the uniformity of the positioning accuracy and the strictness of the relative positions of the adjacent orthoimages. Tests of 139 panchromatic nadir images from the ZY-3 satellite show that by using only a small number of ground control points (GCPs), whose plane accuracy is 5 m, the plane accuracy of independent check points (ICPs) is better than 7 m after planar block adjustment. This accuracy meets the requirements for Chinese 1:50 000 topographic maps. Moreover, the preciseness of tie points (TPs) in adjacent images is better than 0.5 pixels, so a seamless level in mosaic geometry is attained."
Road Extraction from Lidar Data Using Support Vector Machine Classification,"Matkan, Ali Akbar; Hajeb, Mohammad; Sadeghian, Saeed",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2014/00000080/00000005/art00001;jsessionid=5pjp7fg9afoav.x-ic-live-02,"This paper presents a method for road extraction from lidar data based on SVM classification. The lidar data are used exclusively to evaluate the potential in the road extraction process. First, the SVM algorithm is used to classify the lidar data into five classes: road, tree, building, grassland, and cement. Then, some misclassified pixels in the road class is removed using the road values in the normalized Digital Surface Model and Normalized Difference Distance features. In the postprocessing stage, a method based on Radon transform and Spline interpolation is employed to automatically locate and fill the gaps in the road network. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm for gap filling works well on straight roads. The proposed road extraction algorithm is tested on three datasets. An accuracy assessment indicated 63.7 percent, 60.26 percent and 66.71 percent quality for three datasets. Finally, centerline of the detected roads is extracted using mathematical morphology."
Daily Temperature Oscillation Enhancement of Multitemporal LST Imagery,"Miliaresis, George Ch.",pp. 423-428(6),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2014/00000080/00000005/art00002;jsessionid=5pjp7fg9afoav.x-ic-live-02,"This paper addresses a major limitation of remote sensing in biophysical modeling-capturing the diurnal temperature range (DTR) with global datasets at moderate resolution scale. DTR relates to the variation in temperature that occurs between daytime and nighttime daily temperatures. A new context for MODIS land surface temperature modeling is proposed on the basis of the 01:30, 10:30, 13:30, and 22:30 local time Aqua and Terra acquisitions. First, cubic spline interpolation produces an image time series with a uniform six hours sampling per day. Second, the inverse Fourier transform considers the harmonics with period less than or equal to a day, to reconstruct a new image time series, and enhance DTR. Finally, cluster analysis of the reconstructed data set identifies eight clusters that are spatially arranged into a Southern and a Northern group. The temporal variation for each cluster reveals a season dependent DTR that is a key issue in supporting land cover studies in Greece."
An Extended Approach for Biomass Estimation in a Mixed Vegetation Area Using ASAR and TM Data,"Xing, Minfeng; Quan, Xingwen; Li, Xiaowen; He, Binbin",pp. 429-438(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2014/00000080/00000005/art00003;jsessionid=5pjp7fg9afoav.x-ic-live-02,"The use of microwave remote sensing for estimating vegetation biomass is limited in arid regions because of the heterogeneous distribution of vegetation, variable scattering mechanisms from different vegetation components, and the strong influence from underlying ground surface. In order to minimize this problem, a synergistic method of optical and microwave remote sensing data for the retrieval of aboveground biomass (AGB) based on the modified water cloud model (WCM) was developed in this paper. Vegetation coverage which can be easily estimated from optical data as additional information was combined in this method. Dimidiate pixel model (DPM) and phenological subtraction methodology (PSM) were used to estimate vegetation coverage and differentiate vegetation types in the sub-pixel domain, respectively. The percentage cover of unmixed vegetation was incorporated to minimize problems associated with heterogeneous vegetation and sparse vegetation cover. Finally, the accuracy and sources of error in this novel AGB retrieval method were evaluated. The results showed that the predicted AGB correlated with the measured AGB (R2= 0.8007; RMSE = 0.2808 kg/m2)."

Laboratory Measurements of Plant Drying,"Jurdao, Sara; Yebra, Marta; Oliva, Patricia; Chuvieco, Emilio",pp. 451-459(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2014/00000080/00000005/art00005;jsessionid=5pjp7fg9afoav.x-ic-live-02,"The estimation of live fuel moisture content (LFMC) is necessary for fire danger assessment. Several studies have successfully used satellite imagery to estimate LFMC, both using empirical and simulation approaches (Yebra et al., 2013). The latter are based on Radiative Transfer Models (RTM). They are generally more robust and easier to generalize, but they rely heavily on the proper parameterization. Since some of the input parameters are associated with different physiological processes, a better understanding of how those parametersco-vary is necessary for constraining the simulation scenarios, thus avoiding combinations of parameters that are unlikely to occur (for instance, in temperate ecosystems, it is unlikely to find simultaneously high values of leaf chlorophyll and low values of leaf moisture).To improve parameterization of RTM models for LFMC estimation, we conducted a laboratory experiment to measure trends in leaf and canopy variables of two tree species broadly distributed in Eurosiberian climates: Beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and pedunculate Oak (Quercus robur L.). Measurements of LFMC, equivalent water thickness (EWT), dry matter content (DMC), chlorophyll (Ca+b), leaf area index (LAI), leaf angle distribution (LIDF), crown height to width ratio (CHW) and plant reflectance were performed. Significant positive correlations were found between LFMC and EWT (Rs>0.5), and negative ones were found between both parameters and Ca+b(Rs<-0.3). LFMC and EWT were positively related to DMC and LAI, with lower correlation coefficients for the latter. The effect of moisture variation in spectral reflectance was also analyzed using two indices: the spectral angle (SA) and the root mean square error (RMSE).The former contributed the most to the estimation of LFMC variations. Spearman correlation coefficients (Rs) between SA and LFMC were 0.656 and 0.554 for F. sylvatica and Q. robur, respectively; while for RMSE and LFMC they were 0.366 and 0.430, respectively."
A Comparative Study of Land Cover Classification Techniques for “Farmscapes” Using Very High Resolution Remotely Sensed Data,"Verma, Niva Kiran; Lamb, David W.; Reid, Nick; Wilson, Brian",pp. 461-470(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2014/00000080/00000005/art00006;jsessionid=5pjp7fg9afoav.x-ic-live-02,"High spatial resolution images (~10 cm) are routinely available from airborne platforms. Few studies have examined the applicability of using such data to characterize land cover in “farmscapes” comprising open pasture and remnant vegetation communities of varying density. Very high spatial resolution remotely sensed imagery has been used to classify land cover classes on a ~5000 ha extensive grazing farm in Australia. This “farmscape” consisted of open pasture fields, scattered trees, and remnant vegetation (woodlands). The relative performances of object-based and pixel-based approaches to classification were tested for accuracy and applicability. Maximum likelihood classification (MLC) was used for pixel-based classification while the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) technique was used for object-based classification. A range of image sampling scales was tested for image segmentation. At an optimal sampling scale, the pixel-based classification resulted in an overall accuracy of 77 percent, while the object-based classification achieved an overall accuracy of 86 percent. While both the object- and pixel-based classification techniques yielded higher quantitative accuracies, a “more realistic” land cover classification, with few errors due to intermixing of similar classes, was achieved using the object-based method."

Vegetation and soil properties are the primary factors that influence SMCs. This paper discusses the potential effectiveness of remote sensing science and technologies for mapping SMC biogeography by characterizing surface biophysical properties (e.g., plant traits and community composition) strongly correlated with SMCs. Using remotely sensed biophysical properties to predict SMC distributions is extremely challenging because of the intricate interactions between biotic and abiotic factors and between above- and below-ground ecosystems. However, the integration of biophysical and soil remote sensing with geospatial information about the environment holds great promise for mapping SMC biogeography. Additional research needs involve microbial taxonomic definition, soil environmental complexity, and scaling strategies. The collaborative effort of experts from diverse disciplines is essential to linking terrestrial surface biosphere observations with subsurface microbial community distributions using remote sensing."

Subaqueous soils could play an important role in nutrient cycling, algae blooms, the spread of invasive aquatic vegetation, and water quality. The objectives of this study were to (a) characterize some of the morphological, physical and chemical properties of subaqueous soils in Missisquoi Bay based on ground-penetrating radar and soil analysis; and (b) assess relationships among the subaqueous soil landscapes, radar facies, and submersed aquatic vegetation. Coarse Stratified Sediments and Lacustrine Silt radar facies associated with Delta/Nearshore and Lakebed/Bay Bottom subaqueous soil-landscape units covered 90 percent of the study area. The Lacustrine Silt radar facies occurred in relatively deep, low-energy, depositional areas and had the highest P concentrations. The majority of the submersed aquatic vegetation was associated with Delta/Nearshore and Fringing Peatland subaqueous soil landscapes under shallow water."
Geostatistical Methods for Predicting Soil Moisture Continuously in a Subalpine Basin,"Williams, Katherine E.; Anderson, Sharolyn J.",pp. 333-341(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2014/00000080/00000004/art00003;jsessionid=3fxbof8s4d7su.x-ic-live-03,"This study presents spatial statistical methods for examining the distribution of soil moisture in a sub-alpine environment. The high local variability of soil moisture is not well characterized by spatial interpolation from dispersed data points. Interpolation using only field samples from Loch Vale, Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado produced coarse estimates that followed mean soil moisture trends, but failed to capture local mid-slope variation. A properly specified regression model was identified by using dispersed field samples and ancillary data derived from Ikonos-2 and lidar data. This model predicted soil moisture patterns at a much finer spatial resolution. An intensive field campaign provided independent soil moisture measurements that were used to assess the model’s accuracy. The modeled soil moisture estimates captured local variability associated with topographic terrain differences along mid-slope areas."

The most common approach using spectral vegetation indices, however, is difficult in arid and semiarid environments where vegetation is sparse and often senescent. In this study object-oriented classification of high-resolution imagery was used to develop a cost-effective, semi-automated approach for mapping impervious surfaces in Sierra Vista, Arizona for an individual neighborhood and the larger sub-watershed. Results from the neighborhood-scale analysis show that object-oriented classification of QuickBird imagery produced repeatable results with good accuracy. Applying the approach to a 1,179 km2region produced maps of impervious surfaces with a mean overall accuracy of 88.1 percent. This study demonstrates the value of employing object-oriented classification of high-resolution imagery to operationally monitor urban growth in arid lands at different spatial scales in order to fill knowledge gaps critical to effective watershed management."

We present a repeatable method to disaggregate CSM data into ~30-meter resolution rasterized soil class maps that include continuous representation of probabilistic map uncertainty. Methods include training set creation for original CSM component soil classes from soil-landscape descriptions within the original survey database. Training sets are used to build a random forest predictive model utilizing environmental covariate maps derived from ASTER satellite imagery and the USGS National Elevation Dataset. Results showed agreement at 70 percent of independent field validation sites and equivalent accuracy between original CSM map units and the disaggregated map. Uncertainty of predictions was mapped by relating prediction frequencies of the random forest model and success rates at validation sites."

This study used aerial photographs to monitor patterns of built-up land expansion and subsequent agricultural soil sealing between 1994 and 2006 in peri-urban areas of Shanghai, China. Results indicated that a total of 152,706.5 ha of agricultural soils were sealed. In particular, residential land and industrial land were the major contributors. Buffer analysis demonstrated that agricultural soils with high proximity to roads and urban centers are more vulnerable to be sealed. Percentage of sealed agricultural soils of total agricultural soils had linear relationships with population growth and economic development. These results quantitatively document the impacts of urbanization on agricultural soil sealing. From a management perspective, we argue that the protection of agricultural soils should be integrated with urban planning efforts in China."

We simulated HYSPIRI (60 m) along with two multispectral sensors, Thematic Mapper (TM; 30 m) and Advanced Space-borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Spectrometer (ASTER; 15 m), from high-resolution Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS; 3.2 m) imagery in an area infested by buffelgrass near Tucson, Arizona. We compared classification accuracies of all simulated sensors at spatial resolutions of 15 m, 30 m, and 60 m to evaluate tradeoffs of spectral and spatial resolution across the sensors. Although spectroscopically superior to Landsat TM and ASTER, ASTER easily outperformed HYSPIRI for small infestations (225 m2) on account of its spatial resolution. Shortwave-infrared bands near 2.2 µm were key indicators for both HYSPIRI and ASTER, highlighting the benefit of narrow-wave SWIR for mapping invasive species in arid ecosystems."

First, the 3D localization errors of the ideal model are analyzed that shows the correlations with the object-image distance and the viewing angles. Second, the epipolar errors are analyzed and are observed to exhibit changes with the rotation angles and z-coordinates of the image points. Finally, tests are carried out in space resection, epipolar constraints, and bundle adjustment with different sensor models. The outdoor tests with small object-image distance (several meters) show the difference between the two models is notably slight. In contrast, the indoor tests with larger object-image distance (more than 15 m) show the rigorous model produces 2 cm better measurement accuracy than the ideal."

However, due to the complexity of the image and limited availability of advanced techniques, PolSAR image processing is still a challenging issue. In this paper the suggestion of ensemble learning (EL) is introduced into PolSAR image classification by integrating various polarimetric features and multiple classifiers. The most popular ensemble learning methods, including Bagging, AdaBoost, and Rotation Forest are adopted to combine multiple classifiers and polarimetric features. The proposed classification scheme is evaluated on three real PolSAR data. Experimental results shows that the covariance and coherence features can give better performance than other polarimetric decomposition features, and complementary between different polarimetric decomposition features improving the classification performance. Although a weak classifier gives unsatisfactory classification accuracy on polarimetric decomposition features, the performance can be highly improved by using EL strategies."

The heights above MSL are called Orthometric Heights. Presently for India and many other countries, who have not yet established their own geoid, there is no method to convert the ellipsoidal heights to Orthometric heights. For such countries, the only way available to obtain Orthometric heights is through establishing a dense network of leveling lines that is very time consuming, cumbersome, and manpower- and cost-intensive. An alternative solution has been proposed that requires only a very few ground control points to be provided by GPS and a skeletal leveling network for large scale photogrammetric mapping without compromising accuracy. The concept has been validated with the aid of two test areas. It is shown that by adopting the proposed method, there is a significant reduction in the required number of GPS control points by more than 55 percent and the number of MSL height control points (as also the preprocessing/postpointing effort) by as much as 90 percent."
Nested Regression Based Optimal Selection (NRBOS) of Rational Polynomial Coefficients,"Tengfei, Long; Weili, Jiao; Guojin, He",pp. 261-269(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2014/00000080/00000003/art00005;jsessionid=fpo4n0f800dco.x-ic-live-02,"Although the rational function model (RFM) is widely applied in photogrammetry, the application of terrain-dependent RFM is limited because of the requirement for numerous ground control points (GCPs) and the strong correlation between the coefficients. A new method, NRBOS, based on nested regression was proposed to select the optimal RPCs automatically and to gain stable solutions of terrain-dependent RFM using a small amount of GCPs. Different types of images, including QuickBird, SPOT5, Landsat-5, and ALOS, were involved in the tests. NRBOS method performed better than conventional methods in estimating RPCs, and even provided a reliable solution when less than 39 GCPs were used. Additionally, the test results showed that the simplified RPCs are almost as accurate as the vendor-provided RPCs. Consequently, in favorable situations such as when the orientation parameters of the satellite are not available or are not sufficiently accurate, the proposed method has the potential to take the place of the regular terrain-independent RFM."

The model is formulated as the composition of a statistical Binomial model on other statistical base models (parametric or nonparametric). This formulation allows adapting of the pass/fail philosophy of the NMAS to any desired statistical base model, tolerance, percentage of points in error, and risks. The main contribution of this proposal is a common framework for dealing with sampling and risks with independence of the underlying base model (parametric or nonparametric). The use of nonparametric base models is explained and exemplified for the 1D case. For 2D and 3D, the Gaussian base model has been adopted. The Gaussian models allow the combining of error components by means of the Chi Squared and the Gamma distributions. For the 2D case, different situations have been considered in order to analyze the pass/fail behavior, and producer’s and user’s risks."
Filtering Airborne Lidar Data by Modified White Top-Hat Transform with Directional Edge Constraints,"Li, Yong; Yong, Bin; Wu, Huayi; An, Ru; Xu, Hanwei; Xu, Jia; He, Qisheng",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2014/00000080/00000002/art00001;jsessionid=7boqgidb1iahf.x-ic-live-01,"A novel algorithm that employs modified white top-hat(MWTH)transform with directional edge constraints is proposed in this study to automatically extract ground points from airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) data.MWTHtransform can effectively distinguish above-ground objects that are smaller than the window size and higher than the height difference threshold. Directional edge constraints significantly decrease omission errors from protruding ground features. IncorporatingMWTHtransform and directional edge constraints enables the simultaneous consideration of the size, height, and edge characteristics of lidar data for judging above-ground objects. Experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm exhibits promising performance and high accuracy in various complicated landscapes, even in areas with dramatic changes in elevation. The proposed algorithm has minimal omission and commission error oscillation for different test sites, thereby demonstrating its stability and reliability in a wide range of applications."
"Prediction of Forest Attributes with Field Plots, Landsat, and a Sample of Lidar Strips","Strunk, Jacob L.; Temesgen, Hailemariam; Andersen, Hans-Erik; Packalen, Petteri",pp. 143-150(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2014/00000080/00000002/art00002;jsessionid=7boqgidb1iahf.x-ic-live-01,"In this study we demonstrate that sample strips of lidar in combination with Landsat can be used to predict forest attributes more precisely than from Landsat alone. While lidar and Landsat can each be used alone in vegetation mapping, the cost of wall to wall lidar may exceed users’ financial resources, and Landsat may not support the desired level of prediction precision. We compare fitted linear models and k nearest neighbors (kNN) methods to link field measurements, lidar, and Landsat. We also compare 900 m2and 8,100 m2resolutions to link lidar to Landsat. An approach with lidar and Landsat together reduced estimates of residual variability for biomass by up to 36 percent relative to using Landsat alone. Linear models generally performed better than kNN approaches, and when linking lidar to Landsat, using 8,100 m2resolution performed better than 900 m2."

Line features of a parking lot are first extracted by using a line extraction method with principle orientation constraints which offers a reliable basis for the extraction of parking lots structures by emphasizing on the extraction of accurate parking line information. The structure of the parking lots are then determined from the extracted parking lines through a maximum intersection orientation method, parameter-estimating procedure, and a self-adaptive growth method. A comparative experiment is shown and the result indicates that the proposed method can effectively extract parking lot structures with high correctness, high-quality completeness, and good geometric accuracy."
Multi-Agent Recognition System based on Object Based Image Analysis Using WorldView-2,"Mahmoudi, Fatemeh Tabib; Samadzadegan, Farhad; Reinartz, Peter",pp. 161-170(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2014/00000080/00000002/art00004;jsessionid=7boqgidb1iahf.x-ic-live-01,"In this paper, using spatial and spectral characteristics of the WorldView-2 satellite imagery, capabilities of multi-agent systems are used for solving multiple object recognition difficulties in complex urban areas. The methodology has two main steps: object based image analysis (OBIA) and multi-agent object recognition. In the first step, segmentation and multi-process object classification based on spectral, textural, and structural features are performed. Classified regions are used as an input dataset in the multi-agent system in order to modify object recognition results. According to the results from the object based image analysis process, using contextual relations and structural features, the overall accuracy and Kappa improved by 17.79 percent and 0.253, respectively. Using knowledge-based reasoning and cooperative capabilities of agents in the multi-agent system in this paper, most of the remaining difficulties are decreased and values 90.95 percent and 0.876 are obtained for the overall accuracy and Kappa, respectively, of the object recognition results."
An Automatic Parameter Selection Procedure for Pushbroom Sensor Models on Imaging Satellites,"Jeong, Inseong; Bethel, James",pp. 171-178(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2014/00000080/00000002/art00005;jsessionid=7boqgidb1iahf.x-ic-live-01,"For the rigorous, physical modeling of spaceborne, push-broom imaging sensors, over-parameterization and the resulting dependencies among sensor model parameters are a continuing issue causing instability and ambiguity during parameter estimation. Traditionally, this problem has been tackled by a fixed subset approach or by using a priori stochastic constraints, which generally require the user’s intuition or intervention but with no guarantee that an optimal solution is obtained. An efficient and automated procedure to find an optimal parameter subset, that is independent and meets accuracy requirements, has been developed and tested using six images from six representative sensors. The experimental results show a stable performance of the developed procedure which results in a quality subset by the evaluation criteria and tries to minimize the checkpoint misclosure (i.e., LOOCV RMSE) so that the resulting subset can be considered optimum. Therefore, the proposed procedure can be beneficial to the users and sensor model developers by providing an optimal and subjective solution to the well known over-parameterization problem in satellite sensor model."
Combining RapidEye Satellite Imagery and Lidar for Mapping of Mining and Mine Reclamation,"Maxwell, Aaron E.; Warner, Timothy A.; Strager, Michael P.; Pal, Mahesh",pp. 179-189(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2014/00000080/00000002/art00006;jsessionid=7boqgidb1iahf.x-ic-live-01,"The combination of Rapid Eye satellite imagery and light detection and ranging (lidar) derivatives was assessed for mapping land-cover within a mountaintop coal surface mine complex in the southern coalfields of West Virginia, USA. Support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), and boosted classification and regression trees (CART) algorithms were used. Incorporation of the lidar-derived data increased map accuracy in comparison to using only the five imagery bands, and SVM generally produced a more accurate classification than the ensemble tree algorithms based on overall map accuracy, Kappa statistics, allocation disagreement, quantity disagreement, and McNemar’s test of statistical significance. Based on measures of predictor variable importance within the ensemble tree classifiers, the normalized digital surface model (nDSM) was found to be more useful than first return intensity data for differentiating the classes."
Basal Area and Biomass Estimates of Loblolly Pine Stands Using L-band UAVSAR,"Marks, William L.; Iiames, John S.; Lunetta, Ross S.; Khorram, Siamak; Mace, Thomas H.",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2014/00000080/00000001/art00001;jsessionid=c0irdm1k1jgpk.x-ic-live-02,"Fully polarimetric L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter was collected using NASA’s Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) SAR and regressed with in situ measurements of basal area (BA) and above ground biomass (AGB) of mature loblolly pine stands in North Carolina. Results found HH polarization consistently displayed the lowest correlations where HV and VV exhibited the highest correlations in all groups for both BA and AGB. When plantation stands were analyzed separately (plantation versus natural), correlation improved significantly for both BA (R2= 0.65, HV) and AGB (R2= 0.66, VV). Similarly, results improved when natural stands were analyzed separately resulting in the highest correlation for AGB (R2= 0.63, HV and VV). Data decomposition using the Freeman 3-component model indicated that the relative low correlations were due to the saturation of the L-band backscatter across the majority of the study area."
The Feasibility of Using ENVISAT ASAR and ALOS PALSAR to Monitor Pastures in Western Australia,"Wang, Xin; Ge, Linlin; Li, Xiaojing; Gherardi, Stephen",pp. 43-57(15),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2014/00000080/00000001/art00002;jsessionid=c0irdm1k1jgpk.x-ic-live-02,"The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using dual polarization ENVISAT ASAR and ALOS PALSAR data to capture temporal and spatial variations of pasture at paddock scale in Western Australia. SAR backscatter was correlated to NDVI, NDWI, and soil moisture index (M.I) to demonstrate the capability of SAR to measure biomass, plant water content, and soil moisture, respectively. The results proved that ENVI-SAT ASAR and ALOS PALSAR are able to monitor pasture, and the ability varies with sensor parameters (wavelength, polarization, and incidence angle) and field properties (soil moisture, vegetation type, biomass level). Paddock biomass and human activities can be detected; C-band is suitable for grass biomass and L-band detects water content of grass in drying stage. HV (VH) has advantage in detecting plant water content, while VV is sensitive to soil moisture. Ground measurements of pasture biomass successfully validated part of the correlation results."
"Integrating Disparate Lidar Data at the National Scale to Assess the Relationships between Height Above Ground, Land Cover and Ecoregions","Stoker, Jason M.; Cochrane, Mark A.; Roy, David P.",pp. 59-70(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2014/00000080/00000001/art00003;jsessionid=c0irdm1k1jgpk.x-ic-live-02,"With the acquisition of lidar data for over 30 percent of the US, it is now possible to assess the three-dimensional distribution of features at the national scale. This paper integrates over 350 billion lidar points from 28 disparate datasets into a national-scale database and evaluates if height above ground is an important variable in the context of other nationalscale layers, such as the US Geological Survey National Land Cover Database and the US Environmental Protection Agency ecoregions maps. While the results were not homoscedastic and the available data did not allow for a complete height census in any of the classes, it does appear that where lidar data were used, there were detectable differences in heights among many of these national classification schemes. This study supports the hypothesis that there were real, detectable differences in heights in certain national-scale classification schemes, despite height not being a variable used in any of the classification routines."
Fast Hierarchical Segmentation of High-Resolution Remote Sensing Image with Adaptive Edge Penalty,"Zhang, Xueliang; Xiao, Pengfeng; Feng, Xuezhi",pp. 71-80(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2014/00000080/00000001/art00004;jsessionid=c0irdm1k1jgpk.x-ic-live-02,"A fast hierarchical segmentation method (FHS) for high-resolution remote sensing (HR) image is proposed in the paper. FHS is completely unsupervised. It is characterized by two aspects. First, the hierarchical segmentation process is accelerated by the improved linear nearest neighbor graph (LNNG) model and the segment tree model. It runs faster than other existing hierarchical segmentation methods, and can produce multi-resolution segmentations in time linear to the image size. Second, an adaptive edge penalty function is introduced to formulate the merging criterion, serving as a semantic factor. A set of QuickBird, WorldView, and aerial images is used to test the proposed method. The experiments show that the multi-resolution segmentations produced by FHS can represent objects at different scales very well. Moreover, the adaptive edge penalty function helps to remove meaningless weak edges within objects, enclosing the relation between segments and real-world objects."
Automated Cropland Classification Algorithm (ACCA) for California Using Multi-sensor Remote Sensing,"Wu, Zhuoting; Thenkabail, Prasad S.; Verdin, James P.",pp. 81-90(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2014/00000080/00000001/art00005;jsessionid=c0irdm1k1jgpk.x-ic-live-02,"Increasing pressure to feed the growing population with scarce water resources requires accurate and routine cropland mapping. This paper develops and implements a rule-based automated cropland classification algorithm (ACCA) using multi-sensor remote sensing data. Pixel-by-pixel accuracy assessments showed that ACCA produced an overall accuracy of 96 percent (Khat= 0.8) when tested using independent data layers. Furthermore, ACCA-generated county cropland areas showed high agreement (R-square values 0.94) when compared with three independent data sources: (a) US Department of Agriculture (USDA) cropland data layer derived cropland areas, (b) county specific crop acreage data from the Farm Service Agency, and (c) the Census of Agriculture data for the 58 counties in California. Our results demonstrate the ability of ACCA to generate cropland extent and areas over space and time, in an automated fashion with high degree of accuracies year after year, greatly contributing to food and water security analysis and decision making."
Synergistic Use of Optical and PolSAR Imagery for Urban Impervious Surface Estimation,"Guo, Huadong; Yang, Huaining; Sun, Zhongchang; Li, Xinwu; Wang, Cuizhen",pp. 91-102(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2014/00000080/00000001/art00006;jsessionid=c0irdm1k1jgpk.x-ic-live-02,"Impervious surface estimation has been widely conducted with medium-high resolution optical imagery. Challenges however, remain in aspects of spectral similarity of different objects, mixed pixel, and shadows of tall buildings or large tree crowns. In order to reduce these uncertainties, this study explores the synergistic use of optical and radar remote sensing datasets in highly populated urban areas. A comparative analysis is performed between the RADARSAT-2 full POLSAR image and the SPOT5 optical image. For both datasets, the C5.0 decision tree algorithm is applied to select features extracted to build a decision tree for urban impervious surface classification. It is found in this study that optical and POLSAR images possess different merits in delineating urban land surfaces. The POLSAR data is helpful for delineating bright impervious surfaces (e.g., buildings) and bare soils, which is often a difficult task for optical data. However, the confusion between dark impervious surfaces and bare soils becomes a severe problem due to similar surface scattering mechanisms. The intrinsic characteristics of radar scattering (e.g., layover and shadow effects) also result in high uncertainties in dense urban areas. These problems are leveraged when both optical and decomposed POLSAR features are considered. The results from this study indicate that the synergistic use of optical and POLSAR data could be an efficient approach to improving the estimation of urban impervious surfaces."

The instrument was used during a field campaign in the City of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, China, in 2010. Land surface temperature and emissivity were measured near simultaneous with the airborne campaign for calibration and validation of the instrument. Radiance calibration was performed band-by-band using calibration coefficients, and atmospheric correction was performed using data from in situ measurements and the MODTRAN model. Surface temperature and emissivity separation were determined using the ASTER temperature-emissivity separation (ASTER_TES) and iterative spectral smooth temperature and emissivity separation (ISSTES) methods. The ASTER_TES method resulted in satisfactory agreement with ground data, with root mean square error (RMSE) values of 2.2 K for temperature and 0.0460 for broad-emissivity. The ISSTES method provided better ground validation results, with a RMSE for temperature of 1.8 K and a RMSE for broad-emissivity of 0.0394. The emissivity shapes acquired by the two methods were very similar. The results have relevance to studies of global climate change, environmental monitoring, classification, feature mining, and target recognition."
Hierarchical Method of Urban Building Extraction Inspired by Human Perception,"Tao, Chao; Tan, Yihua; Zou, Zheng-rong",pp. 1109-1119(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000012/art00002;jsessionid=2fguu01vmcgx7.x-ic-live-03,"In a high-resolution satellite image, buildings can be considered as clustered objects belonging to the same category. Human perception of such objects consists of an initial identification of simple instances followed by recognition of more complicated ones by deduction. Inspired by this observation, a hierarchical building extraction framework is proposed to simulate the process, which includes three major components. First, a total variation-based segmentation algorithm is presented to decompose the given image into object-level elements. Then, shape analysis is applied to extract some common and easily identified rectangular buildings. Finally, the detection of buildings with complex structures is formulated as a deduction problem based on preceding extracted information in terms of maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, and a Bayesian based approach is proposed to deal with it. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of efficiently identifying urban buildings from high-resolution satellite images."

Acquiring accurate ground inventory data is time-consuming, expensive and limited to small areas; but lidar data can be used to assess the impact of fires, and also to determine the convenient silvicultural measurements which should be carried out for site restoration. The aim of this paper was to assess the post-fire regeneration status of the vegetation in Sant Llorenç del Munt massif after a wildfire in summer 2003 by modeling the relationship between lidar height bins and canopy height model (CHM) with field data. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) prediction models provided estimations of vegetation fraction cover, average height (HM) over 1.30 m and number of stems over 1.30 m, with Pearson r values between 0.18 and 0.83. Classification models built with the same variables allowed separating two ground-based regeneration classes (good and scarce regeneration) with an approximate accuracy of 83 to 76 percent (model building and validation data, respectively)."

In this study, three ZY-3 datasets (Dengfeng, Anping, and Taihang) were used to evaluate the accuracy of bundle adjustment using triplet stereo images. For both standard and long-strip scenes, the RMS errors of plane and elevation were 2.6 m and 1.6 m, respectively, when ground control points (GCPS) were deployed around the corners. The digital surface model (DSM) of the Dengfeng dataset was compared with a reference DEM (1:2000); the RMS errors produced varied with topography, with values of 3.9 m, 6.4 m, and 6.8 m for plain, hilly, and steep mountainous areas, respectively."
3D Tree Reconstruction from Simulated Small Footprint Waveform Lidar,"Wu, Jiaying; Cawse-Nicholson, Kerry; van Aardt, Jan",pp. 1147-1157(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000012/art00005;jsessionid=2fguu01vmcgx7.x-ic-live-03,"Lidar-based 3D tree reconstruction enables the retrieval of detailed tree structure; however, many existing methods are based on high-density discrete return lidar datasets. In this paper, we propose the use of small footprint waveform lidar data to achieve branch-level tree reconstruction for both leaf-off and leaf-on conditions. The DIRSIG simulation environment was used for algorithm validation purposes. Leaf-off data served as reference, and leaf-on reconstruction for a particular tree resulted in an average branch length difference of 0.07 m and an average angular difference of approximately 6 degrees for both tilt and azimuth angles. Compared to in situ methods this approach may be used by an airborne system for accurate estimation of forest biomass, forest inventory, land degradation, etc. in large scale applications. Furthermore, since this approach can also be applied on leaf-on trees, the tree skeleton characterization eventually can be conducted year round and will be less dependent on seasonal changes."

The method used collection year as the “response” variable, and the algorithm was applied in two stages to reduce the effects of cloud cover upon the results and to reveal the temporal distribution of cloudy conditions. The analysis identified a shift in environmental conditions between 2003 and 2004 when cloudy and wet conditions were replaced by clear and dry conditions. Gradual changes that occurred throughout the study period were also detected. The analysis also confirmed that it could detect that region’s recent (2007, 2010, 2011) warming associated with sea ice melting."
A Combined Object- and Pixel-Based Image Analysis Framework for Urban Land Cover Classification of VHR Imagery,"Salehi, Bahram; Zhang, Yun; Zhong, Ming",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000011/art00001;jsessionid=1x88kbecc5aat.x-ic-live-03,"This paper aims at exploiting the advantages of pixel-based and object-based image analysis approaches for urban land cover classification of very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery through a combined object- and pixel-based image analysis framework. The framework starts with segmenting the image resulting in several spectral and spatial features of segments. To overcome the curse of dimensionality, a wavelet-based feature extraction method is proposed to reduce the number of features. The wavelet-based method is automatic, fast, and can preserve local variations in objects’ spectral/ spatial signatures. Finally, the extracted features together with the original bands of the image are classified using the conventional pixel-based Maximum Likelihood classification. The proposed method was tested on the WorldView-2, QuickBird, and Ikonos images of the same urban area for comparison purposes. Results show up to 17 percent, 10 percent, and 11 percent improvement in kappa coefficients compared to the case in which only the original bands of the image are used for WV-2, QB, and IK, respectively. Furthermore, the objects’ spectral features contribute more to increasing classification accuracy than spatial features."

The study used MODIS NDVI time-series data to derive landcover products (2007) in a study area within the Laurentian Great Lakes Basin (GLB). Area-based reference data (i.e., “maplets”) were varied in size and number to assess landcover proportionality agreement and to provide accuracy assessment metrics generated by point-based methodology. High spatial resolution Landsat ETM data was used to assess pixel purity (PP) for the MODIS 250 m pixels imbedded within the maplets (i.e., percent homogeneous) for the dominant cover type. Comparisons between the maplet reference data found a 21.7 percent variation in accuracy values between PP50 percent (67.9 percent accuracy) and PP100 percent (89.6 percent accuracy). Point-based accuracy assessments typically use 100 percent homogeneous reference pixels to assess landcover products, positively biasing the accuracy values. Our area-based methodology allows for the assessment at varying reference pixel homogeneity."

From pixel-based processing designed for low spatial resolution data, image processing has shifted towards object-based analysis in order to adapt to the hyperspatial nature of currently available remote sensing data. However, standard object-based classifiers work with only object-level summary statistics of the reflectance values and do not sufficiently exploit within-object reflectance pattern. In this research, a novel approach of utilizing the object-level distribution of reflectance values is presented. A fuzzy Kolmogorov-Smirnov based classifier is proposed to provide an object-to-object matching of the empirical distribution of the reflectance values of each object and derive a fuzzy membership grade to each class. This object- based classifier is tested for urban objects recognition from WorldView-2 data. Results indicate at least 10 percent increase in overall classification accuracy using the proposed classifier in comparison to various popular object- and pixel-based classifiers."

However, there are two major issues associated with the use of Markov models for land-cover change projections: the stationarity of change and the impact of neighboring cells on the change areas. This study addressed these two issues using an investigation of five time-series land-cover datasets generated between 1972 and 2009 for the Liverpool region of NSW, Australia. Four short-term transition matrices were computed, and the results were used to predict land-cover distributions for the near future. The issue of neighborhood effects was addressed by incorporating spatial components in a Cellular Automata (CA)-based MCM, and the results were compared with those derived from a normal MCM. Given the marginal improvements in the simulation achieved with CA-MCM rather than MCM, and because of the ability of CA-MCM to incorporate spatial variants, CA-MCM was determined to be the more suitable method for predicting land-cover changes for the year 2019. The land-cover projection indicated that future land-cover changes will likely continue to affect the natural vegetation, which will in turn likely decrease through the continued conversion of natural to agricultural lands over the years."
Parcel-Level Identification of Crop Types Using Different Classification Algorithms and Multi-Resolution Imagery in Southeastern Turkey,"Alganci, Ugur; Sertel, Elif; Ozdogan, Mutlu; Ormeci, Cankut",pp. 1053-1065(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000011/art00005;jsessionid=1x88kbecc5aat.x-ic-live-03,"This research investigates the accuracy of pixel- and object-based classification techniques across varying spatial resolutions to identify crop types at parcel level and estimate the area at six test sites to find the optimum data source for the identification of crop parcels. Multi-sensor data with spatial resolutions of 2.5 m, 5 m and 10 m from SPOT5 and 30 m from Landsat-5 TM were used. Maximum Likelihood (ML), Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were used as pixel-based methods in addition to object-based image classification (OBC). Post-classification methods were applied to the output of pixel-based classification to minimize the noise effects and heterogeneity within the agricultural parcels. In addition, processing-time performance of the algorithms was evaluated for the test sites and district scale classification. OBC results provided comparatively the best performance for both parcel identification and area estimation at 10 m and finer spatial resolution levels. SVM followed OBC at 2.5 m and 5 m resolutions but accuracies decreased dramatically with coarser resolutions. ML and SAM results were worse up to 30 m resolution for both crop type identification and area estimation. In general, parcel identifi-cation efficiency was strongly correlated with spatial resolution while the classification algorithm was a more effective factor than spatial resolution for area estimation accuracy. Results also provided an opportunity to discuss the effects of image resolution and the classification algorithm independent factors such as parcel size, spatial distribution of crop types and crop patterns."

A great deal of the decisions required during those operations is of spatial nature, such as defining areas with high priority for safeguarding. Also, real time decision making is required in the operations. All this calls for spatial and on-site accessible tools. We analyze and discuss in this paper geospatial Web services and an application developed for responding to the ecological risk posed by oil spills. The presented case study concerns the Gulf of Finland and the Finnish Archipelago Sea. The results indicate that geospatial services are an efficient method to deliver ecological knowledge and information for oil spill combating."
Geospatial Web-based Sensor Information Model for Integrating Satellite Observation,"Hu, Chuli; Chen, Nengcheng; Li, Jia",pp. 915-927(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000010/art00002;jsessionid=1bw1qynpglp0p.x-ic-live-01,"Flood observation-supporting satellite sensors (FO-SSs) are the important geospatial resources to flood disaster management. In the geospatial sensor Web environment, effective flood disaster management requires on-demand integration of instant observation information from the diverse web-ready FO-SSs. We propose a sharable and interoperable Earth Observation Satellite Sensor Information (SSI) model for satellite observations integration. The SSI model reuses and extends the existing metadata standards to be a standard metadata-filled description framework. The SensorModel prototype serving here is to apply the SSI model into FO-SSs, retrieve and visualize the qualified Web-ready FO-SSs. An experiment on the flood emergency in the middle reaches of Yangtze River basin in China is conducted. The results show that, three kinds of users including FO-SSs providers, common emergency responders, and emergency managers can benefit from the proposed FO-SSI model, and the managers can reliably and comprehensively integrate the satisfied Web-ready FO-SSs to guide the scheduling of the required observation activities."

Traditional approaches and existing systems are not able to meet the demand because of big-data and geoprocessing-modeling challenges. The latest advances in Web service, geospatial interoperability and cyberinfrastructure technologies and the availability of near real-time global remote sensing data have shown potential to address the challenges and meet the demand. This paper presents a Web service approach to building the Global Agricultural Drought Monitoring and Forecasting System (GADMFS), an open, interoperable, and on-demand geospatial Web service system, for meeting the demand. The big-data and geoprocessing-modeling issues in providing complete agricultural drought information are resolved in GADMFS through improved data-, service- and system-level interoperability and servability. GADMFS is able to overcome major limitations of current drought information systems in the world and better support decision making with improved global agricultural drought data and information dissemination and analysis services."

Recent data can be indexed rapidly in about 10 minutes/terabyte. With the mobile application, FastRspondr, Smartphone users can use a rapid Fast-Earth look-up to discover layers of data, download small chips, and flicker multiple image layers in less than a minute. Our fast rubble detection algorithm applied at the server enhances mono-temporal post-event optical imagery in less than one second/plat.

Selecting Key Features for Remote Sensing Classification by Using Decision-Theoretic Rough Set Model,"Xie, Feng; Chen, Dongmei; Meligrana, John; Lin, Yi; Ren, Wenwei",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000009/art00001;jsessionid=22yh8xcfexxhx.x-ic-live-03,"There are many spectral bands or band functions developed for land-cover feature measurements. When the ratio of the number of training samples to the number of feature measurements is small, the traditional land-cover classification is not accurate. To solve this problem, a decision-theoretic rough set model (DTRSM) is first introduced. This model is linked with distinguishing different types of samples in the image. The samples in the minority classes will be misclassified based on the model. To minimize the misclassification, we propose an improved feature selection algorithm with comprehensive criteria. This algorithm is implemented on the Landsat TM data covering two disparate regions which are Lake Baiyangdian and Qingpu District in Shanghai located in the north and south of China, respectively. We compare the algorithm with other feature selection algorithms. Results show that the proposed method can effectively select key features for different data sets and the accuracy of classifiers can be ensured."
Assessing the Relationship between Ground Measurements and Object-Based Image Analysis of Land Cover Classes in Pinyon and Juniper Woodlands,"Hulet, April; Roundy, Bruce A.; Petersen, Steven L.; Jensen, Ryan R.; Bunting, Stephen C.",pp. 799-808(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000009/art00002;jsessionid=22yh8xcfexxhx.x-ic-live-03,"Land managers need to rapidly assess vegetation composition and bare ground to effectively evaluate and manage shrub steppe communities that have been encroached by pinyon and juniper trees. We used an object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach to estimate land cover classes found in pinyon-juniper woodlands, and evaluated the relationship between ground measurements and OBIA land cover measurements. We acquired high-spatial resolution color-infrared imagery for five sites with a Vexcel UltraCamX digital camera in June 2009. We simultaneously collected ground-based cover measurements within 30 m × 33 m subplots. OBIA mean land cover class differences by site ranged from underestimating litter by 3 percent to overestimating live trees by 1 percent when compared to ground-based measurements. Overall accuracy for thematic maps was 84 percent with a Kappa statistic of 0.80. Although OBIA cover estimates varied slightly from ground cover estimates, methods provide land managers with options for prioritizing management practices and enabling monitoring at an operational scale."
Remote Sensing-based House Value Estimation Using an Optimized Regional Regression Model,"Lu, Zhenyu; Im, Jungho; Quackenbush, Lindi J.; Yoo, Sanglim",pp. 809-820(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000009/art00003;jsessionid=22yh8xcfexxhx.x-ic-live-03,"This study proposed a new method to predict residential property value using remote sensing data as a major data source substitute to traditional inputs in house price estimation models. An optimized regional regression (ORR) approach was proposed in this study. This approach integrated a differential evolution optimization algorithm along with the ordinary least square regression to improve house value prediction accuracy. In addition to ORR, four other regression methods, random forest, Cubist regression trees, geographically weighted regression, and global ordinary least square, were also employed to provide a comparison. Results showed that models using remote sensing data are capable of acquiring accurate house price information. In addition, the volume of residential buildings proved to be an efficient substitute for total living area, the most important variable of the house price estimation model (i.e., a hedonic model). The ORR approach yielded the most accurate predictions followed by the geographically weighted regression. Further investigation indicated that the ORR approach has three major advantages: it is effective, stable, and the results are readily interpretable."
Point-based Classification of Power Line Corridor Scene Using Random Forests,"Kim, Heungsik B.; Sohn, Gunho",pp. 821-833(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000009/art00004;jsessionid=22yh8xcfexxhx.x-ic-live-03,"The power line network, interconnecting power generation facilities and their end-users, is a critical infrastructure on which most of our socio-economic activities rely. As society becomes increasingly reliant on electricity, the rapid and effective monitoring of power line safety is critical. In particular, accurately knowing the current geometric and thermal status of power lines and identifying possible encroachments is the most important task in the power line risk management process. To facilitate this task, the correct identification of key objects comprising a power line corridor scene from remotely sensed data is the first important step. In recent years, airborne lidar has been successfully adopted as a cost-effective and accurate data source for mapping the power line corridors. However, in today’s practice, the classification of power line objects using lidar data still relies on labor-intensive data manipulation, and its automation is urgently required. To address this problem, this paper proposes a point-based supervised classification method, which enables the identification of five utility corridor objects (wires, pylons, vegetation, buildings, and low objects) using airborne lidar data. A total of 21 features were investigated to illustrate the horizontal and vertical properties of power line objects. A non-parametric discriminative classifier, Random Forests model, was trained with refined features to label raw laser point clouds. The proposed classifier showed 91.04 percent sample-weighted and 90.07 percent class-weighted classification accuracy, which indicates it could be highly valuable for large-scale, rapid compilations of corridor maps. A sensitivity analysis of the proposed classifier suggested that when compared, training with class-balanced samples improves classification performance over training with unbalanced samples, particularly with corridor objects such as wires and pylons."
A Random Set Approach for Modeling Integrated Uncertainties of Traffic Islands Derived from Airborne Laser Scanning Points,"Zhou, Liang; Stein, Alfred",pp. 835-845(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000009/art00005;jsessionid=22yh8xcfexxhx.x-ic-live-03,"Traffic islands play a major role in transport studies by affecting traffic behavior safety, air pollution, and transport decision support. Point data obtained by laser scanning enable the determination of their locations. Planimetric errors, vertical errors, and limited point spacing however affect their spatial data quality (SDQ). In this study, we defined uncertainty as the lack of accuracy and analyzed its importance by modeling each traffic island as a random set. The covering functions of the point data and their intermediate locations were determined by point segmentation, followed by interpolation. In this way, traffic islands were delineated from the background with a transition zone. The study showed that point spacing has the largest contribution to the positonal accuracy of a traffic island. The area of the transition zone has a linear relation with the planimetric errors, whereas the influence of the vertical errors on the accuracy decreases with increasing point spacing. Experiments were conducted to investigate the influences of the parameters in an SDQ analysis. The study demonstrated how different sources of uncertainty can be integrated. Results showed the advantages of using random sets for SDQ modelling. We concluded that modelling of traffic islands by random sets provides meaningful information to integrate uncertainties."
Assessing the Performance of Linear Feature Models,"Arima, Eugenio Y.; Walker, Robert T.; Vergara, Dante G.",pp. 847-855(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000009/art00006;jsessionid=22yh8xcfexxhx.x-ic-live-03,"A methodology for judging the performance of simulation models that involve linear features is presented taking as its test case a model that produces logging road networks. The approach combines existing methods of accuracy assessment, based on the so-called epsilon band, with the principle of statistical inference. This requires adapting neutral models from landscape ecology to generate a bootstrapped probability distribution reflecting the probabilistic characteristics of stochastic networks. The distribution is then used for inferential hypothesis testing, taking as its “null” hypothesis that a network has been produced randomly. The assessment methodology is used to evaluate the road network simulation model under six different parameterizations. Results are compared to findings obtained by the use of fuzzy similarity metrics. The paper argues that the epsilon band method provides confi-dence that model performance departs significantly from a randomized process, and that conclusions are free of at least one class of spurious results."
Range Image Techniques for Fast Detection and Quantification of Changes in Repeatedly Scanned Buildings,"Kang, Zhizhong; Zhang, Liqiang; Yue, Huanyin; Lindenbergh, Roderik",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000008/art00001;jsessionid=2j0il3bts2s9k.x-ic-live-02,"This paper proposes a new method for the detection and quantification of changes in buildings using terrestrial laser scanning data from different epochs. A refined registration process is implemented that utilizes an optimized version of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm, which implements the search of adjacent points in terms of their scanning angles. For detecting changes, a novel 2D angular difference histogram is proposed to first determine point segments representing building parts from the raw scattered scans. Afterwards, Hausdorff distance-based change detection is innovatively integrated into the optimized ICP process to improve the efficiency of the entire algorithm. The detected changes are quantified in the final step by determining the total planar surface area of the changed facade. This approach is tested and illustrated on two real datasets. The change quantification results show that the accuracy of the changed area quantification is in the order of square centimeters."
A Methodology to Characterize Vertical Accuracies in Lidar-derived Products at Landscape Scales,"Tinkham, Wade T.; Hoffman, Chad M.; Falkowski, Michael J.; Smith, Alistair M.S.; Marshall, Hans-Peter; Link, Timothy E.",pp. 709-716(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000008/art00002;jsessionid=2j0il3bts2s9k.x-ic-live-02,"Light detection and ranging (lidar) is the premier technology for high-resolution elevation measurements in complex landscapes. Lidar error assessments allow for objective interpretation of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and products reliant on these layers. The purpose of this study is to spatially estimate the vertical error of a lidar-derived DEM across seven cover types through modeling of field survey data. We use thirty-four variables and ground-based field survey data in a Random Forest regression to predict elevation error. Four variables captured the variability within the lidar errors, with three variables relevant to the distribution of returns within the vegetation and one relating to the terrain form. Good agreement was observed when comparing the survey against the model predictions (μ = .0.02 m, s = 0.13 m, and RMSE = 0.14 m). With most lidar products reliant upon accurate production of DEMs, providing spatially explicit assessments of uncertainty at the landscape level will increase user confidence in lidar products."
A Coarse Elevation Map-based Registration Method for Super-resolution of Three-line Scanner Images,"Qin, Rongjun; Gong, Jianya; Li, Hongli; Huang, Xianfeng",pp. 717-730(14),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000008/art00003;jsessionid=2j0il3bts2s9k.x-ic-live-02,"Three-line scanner imagery provides three overlapped images in an along-base direction, and creates a possible avenue to obtain higher quality images through the application of the super-resolution. Accurate co-registration of the three images is a key step for super-resolution. However, discontinuities and occlusions resulting from the 3D-to-2D projection cause mis-registration in traditional 2D-image-level co-registration methods. In this paper, we address this problem by introducing 3D information extracted from image triplets by using GPS/IMU data as an approximation. The core of the proposed method is to use a number of height layers derived from feature points and image partitions, in the form of a coarse elevation map (CEM), as a 3D constraint to restrict registration on the corresponding height. In terms of super-resolution, we also propose a tree-based fast adaptive template matching method for Knife-edge detection to fully automate the SRKE super-resolution algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method produces improved registered images and accordingly yields significant resolution enhancement as compared to other methods."
Registration of Optical Images with Lidar Data and Its Accuracy Assessment,"Zheng, Shunyi; Huang, Rongyong; Zhou, Yang",pp. 731-741(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000008/art00004;jsessionid=2j0il3bts2s9k.x-ic-live-02,"Photogrammetry and lidar are two technologies complementary for 3D reconstruction. However, the problem is that the current registration methods of optical images with lidar data cannot satisfy all the requirements for the fusion of the above two technologies, especially for close-range photogrammetry and terrestrial lidar. In this paper, we propose a novel method for registration of optical images with terrestrial lidar data, which is implemented by minimizing the distances from the photogrammetric matching points to terrestrial lidar data surface, with the collinearity equation as the basic mathematical model. One advantage of this method is that it requires no feature extraction and segmentation from the lidar data. Another advantage is that non-rigid deformation caused by lens distortion can be eliminated through the use of bundle adjustment similar to self-calibration. In addition, experiments with two different data sets show that this method cannot only eliminate the influence of certain gross errors, but also offer a high accuracy of 3 mm to 5 mm. Therefore, the proposed registration method is proved to be more effective, accurate, and reliable."

A lidar point cloud and optical image are two typical data that need to be integrated for data assimilation and information retrieval. This paper aims to solve the registration problem of aerial imagery and airborne lidar data in desert areas where traditional registration methods have difficulties in identifying registration primitives. In many deserts, such as the Sahara in Africa and Gobi in China, we observe that there are unevenly distributed desert bushes, which can be used as cues for registration. In this paper, we propose a registration approach using the centroids of bushes as registration primitives. This approach employs similar triangles created from both centroids as the evidence for matching and verifies the registration by the RANSAC algorithm. Experiments using data taken from the Dunhuang Gobi Desert in China show the registration surface model visually, and at the same time quantifies the deviation error, which corroborates that the proposed registration method is effective and feasible in desert areas."
Robust Affine-Invariant Line Matching for High Resolution Remote Sensing Images,"Chen, Min; Shao, Zhenfeng",pp. 753-760(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000008/art00006;jsessionid=2j0il3bts2s9k.x-ic-live-02,"Point-based matching methods usually hold limitation in dealing with low texture scenes. In this paper, a robust affineinvariant lines matching method is proposed. The method commences with line segments extraction. All the extracted line segments are grouped into salient lines and general lines. Accordingly, the matching procedure includes salient lines matching and general lines matching. In salient lines matching, affine invariants are calculated and the matched salient line correspondences are the basis of the general lines matching. Each general line is clustered into a matched salient line according to a certain rule. Taking each salient line as the root, together with all the general lines clustered to it, a control network is constructed. Finally, the general lines matching procedure is performed between the two subnetworks whose roots are correspondences. Experimental results show that our proposed method can successfully process local distortion and improve the matching performance in low texture areas."

The goal of this research was to examine the effects on wetland mapping accuracy of varying input datasets and thematic detail in two physiographically different study areas using a decision tree classifier. The results indicate that: topo-graphic data and derivatives significantly increase mapping accuracy over optical imagery alone, the source of the elevation data and the type of topographic derivatives used were not major factors, the inclusion of radar and leaf-off imagery did not improve mapping accuracy, and increasing thematic detail resulted in significantly lower mapping accuracies i.e., particularly in more diverse wetland areas."

The input parameters include the orbital state and attitude information of the ISS and the look vector of the sensor. The proposed algorithm agrees with the commercial navigation product, Satellite Tool Kit®, within 0.5 m in ideal situations. The inherent uncertainties in ISS attitude and state determinations, and the International Space Station Agriculture Camera (ISSAC) tilting angle were estimated to introduce an error less than 800 m. However, the actual geolocation error evaluated using the images obtained by the ISSAC is roughly 4 km, much greater than the inherent uncertainty and mainly due to (a) delay caused by the Windows®operating system in acquiring images, and (b) the misalignment of the ISSAC sensor coordinate system with the ISS body-fixed coordinate system. A preliminary cal/val process using the Google Earth™as reference was performed to quantify these two errors, the correction of which improved the geolocation accuracy to 500 m, well within the inherent uncertainty."

Multi-frequency DINSAR using C- and L-band SAR data facilitates to monitor land subsidence scenario in totality. C-band DINSAR has been found particularly useful to identify slowly subsiding areas with a sub-centimeter level of precision. Furthermore, the initial hypothesis that land subsidence in Bandung Basin has been occurring due to excessive groundwater withdrawal has been established in this study. A predictive modeling approach has been adopted to estimate the rates of potential subsidence due to elastic and inelastic deformations of the aquifer and overlying strata in response to the lowering of groundwater level."
Utility of the Wavelet Transform for LAI Estimation Using Hyperspectral Data,"Banskota, Asim; Wynne, Randolph H.; Serbin, Shawn P.; Kayastha, Nilam; Thomas, Valerie A.; Townsend, Philip A.",pp. 653-662(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000007/art00004;jsessionid=iu56etmjasfp.x-ic-live-02,"We employed the discrete wavelet transform to reflectance spectra obtained from hyperspectral data to improve estimation of LAI in temperate forests. We estimated LAI for 32 plots across a range of forest types in Wisconsin using hemispherical photography. Plot spectra were extracted from AVIRIS data and transformed into wavelet features using the Haar wavelet. Separately, subsets of spectral bands and the Haar features selected by a genetic algorithm were used as independent variables in linear regressions. Models using wavelet coefficients explained the most variance for both broadleaf plots (R2= 0.90 for wavelet features versus R2= 0.80 for spectral bands) and all plots independent of forest type (R2= 0.79 for wavelet features vs. R2= 0.58 for spectral bands). The forest-type specific models were better than the models using all plots combined. Overall, wavelet features appear superior to band reflectances alone for estimating temperate forest LAI using hyperspectral data."

However, to meet stringent accuracy requirements and minimize systematic errors, proper calibration of the lidar system is required. “Boresighting” is a technique used to correct for some of these systematic errors and improve the spatial alignment of lidar passes. One challenge with boresighting is the mensuration accuracy to which a known point can be located in overlapping low density lidar strips. To address this issue, a raised Hexagonal Retro-Reflective Lidar ground Target (HRRT) is introduced. The target was optimized for precise mensuration at low point densities. The mensuration model is based on a least squares hexagon fitting approach and is proven to produce mensuration accuracies of 5 cm horizontal and 4 cm vertical (1-sigma) at ~2 pts/m2. To demonstrate a practical application, the HRRT’s are used as tie points in a rigorous boresight adjustment to compute lidar strip misalignment parameters (roll, pitch, heading, and range bias). The adjustment results show that accurate boresight parameters are recovered along with their associated uncertainties."
Band Grouping versus Band Clustering in SVM Ensemble Classification of Hyperspectral Imagery,"Bigdeli, Behnaz; Samadzadegan, Farhad; Reinartz, Peter",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000006/art00001;jsessionid=29lf14i25r8l1.x-ic-live-02,"Due to the dense sampling of spectral signatures of land covers, hyperspectral images have a better discrimination among similar ground cover classes than traditional remote sensing data. However, these images are usually composed of tens or hundreds of spectrally close bands, which result in high redundancy and great amount of computation time in hyperspectral image classification. In addition, the large number of spectral bands, but limited availability of training samples creates the problem of Hughes phenomenon. Consequently, traditional classification strategies have often limited performance in classification of hyperspectral imagery. Referring to the limitation of single classifiers in these situations, classifier ensemble system may exhibit better performance. This paper presents a method for classification of hyper-spectral data based on two concepts of Band Clustering (BC) and Band Grouping (BG) through a Support Vector machine (SVM) ensemble system. The proposed method uses the BC\BG strategies to split data into few band portions. After this step, we applied SVM on each band cluster\group that is produced in previous step. Finally, Naive Bayes as a classifier fusion method combines the decisions of SVM classifiers. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the classification accuracy in comparison to the standard SVM and to feature selection methods."
An Automated Approach for the Conflation of Vector Parcel Map with Imagery,"Song, Wenbo; Keller, James M.; Haithcoat, Timothy L.; Davis, Curt H.; Hinsen, Jason B.",pp. 535-543(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000006/art00002;jsessionid=29lf14i25r8l1.x-ic-live-02,"Local governments frequently use parcel maps or other spatial data for decision-making, but much of this data is often inaccurate and outdated, producing a negative influence on the expected outcome. Remote sensing can provide accurate and current high-resolution imagery. However, one major bottleneck to the integration of high-resolution imagery into existing geographic information systems is the issue of positional accuracy of the existing line-work within the vector GIS database, making it difficult to match with imagery. This paper presents a vector-to-imagery conflation approach to improve the positional accuracy of digital parcel maps by conflating the vector parcel maps to make it consistent with high-resolution imagery. Road intersections are automatically extracted from imagery and used as control points. A relaxation labeling algorithm is used to find the matches between the two road intersection point sets from vector and imagery. The links are created from the matched point pairs and are used to perform a piecewise transformation. The test results show that this approach can improve the accuracy of vector parcel maps significantly. It is a very cost-effective method and has great potential to save considerable time and money for local governments to upgrade their inaccurate vector datasets."
Developing Efficient Procedures for Automated Sinkhole Extraction from Lidar DEMs,"Miao, Xin; Qiu, Xiaomin; Wu, Shuo-Sheng; Luo, Jun; Gouzie, Douglas R.; Xie, Hongjie",pp. 545-554(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000006/art00003;jsessionid=29lf14i25r8l1.x-ic-live-02,"Sinkhole detection in karst areas is usually difficult through remote sensing image interpretation. We present an efficient approach to extract mature sinkholes from lidar DEM. First, an adaptive Wiener filter (AWF) and hierarchical watershed segmentation (HWS) are applied to identify all local depression or potential sinkholes. Second, a hole-filling algorithm is applied to the potential sinkholes, and nine spatial features are extracted. Finally, the random forest classifier is used to select true sinkholes from all potential sinkholes. Our results show that this approach is efficient for detecting mature sinkholes from lidar data, and it can be used for risk assessment and hazard preparedness in karst areas."
A Flexible Method for Zoom Lens Calibration and Modeling Using a Planar Checkerboard,"Wu, Bo; Hu, Han; Zhu, Qing; Zhang, Yeting",pp. 555-571(17),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000006/art00004;jsessionid=29lf14i25r8l1.x-ic-live-02,"This paper presents a flexible method for zoom lens calibration and modeling using a planar checkerboard. The method includes the following four steps. First, the principal point of the zoom-lens camera is determined by a focus-of-expansion approach. Second, the influences of focus changes on the principal distance are modeled by a scale parameter. Third, checkerboard images taken at varying object distances with convergent image geometry are used for camera calibration. Finally, the variations of the calibration parameters with respect to the various zoom and focus settings are modeled using polynomials. Three different types of lens are examined in this study. Experimental analyses show that high precision calibration results can be expected from the developed approach. The relative measurement accuracy (accuracy normalized with object distance) using the calibrated zoom-lens camera model ranges from 1:5 000 to 1:25 000. The developed method is of significance to facilitate the use of zoom-lens camera systems in various applications such as robotic exploration, hazard monitoring, traffic monitoring, and security surveillance."
Stitching and Processing Gnomonic Projections for Close-Range Photogrammetry,"Barazzetti, Luigi; Previtali, Mattia; Scaioni, Marco",pp. 573-582(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000006/art00005;jsessionid=29lf14i25r8l1.x-ic-live-02,"This paper presents a 3D reconstruction methodology based on gnomonic projections generated from multiple central perspectives. The method can be useful when traditional images are insufficient to capture fine portions of objects with an adequate level of detail, especially in close-range photogrammetry. The aim of this paper is to prove that gnomonic projections are powerful tools to recover small details that cannot be reconstructed from standard images. The generation of the gnomonic projections is discussed, as well as the methodology to compute camera parameters, orient multiple projections, and finally extract textured 3D models or orthophotos. To verify the correctness of the methodology, some comparisons with sets of independent checkpoints were carried out. The accuracy assessment confirmed the correctness of the mathematical approach and underlined how gnomonic projections are a valid alternative to standard images. The method itself has been already used in surveys for cultural heritage documentation."
"Influence of a Dense, Low-height Shrub Species on the Accuracy of a Lidar-derived DEM","Gould, Samuel B.; Glenn, Nancy F.; Sankey, Temuulen T.; McNamara, James P.",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000005/art00001;jsessionid=1w7baxt26l7ab.x-ic-live-01,"Airborne lidar provides an effective platform for collecting elevation data. However, the accuracy of lidar-derived digital elevation models (DEMs) can be adversely affected by natural conditions as well as methods used to process the data. Using a lidar dataset from a mountainous region of southwest Idaho, this study extends previous assessments of DEM accuracy with a focused investigation of a specific dense, low-height shrub species (Ceanothus velutinus). Bare-earth elevations were collected using survey-grade GPS and compared to lidar-derived elevations to assess DEM accuracy. Results suggest that the magnitude of elevation error varied depending on morphological characteristics of ceanothus, terrain slope, and filtering parameters used to process the lidar data. When using optimal filtering parameters, root mean square error (RMSEZ) was largest in areas of ceanothus cover, ranging from 0.17 to 0.26 m in slopes <25° and 0.28 to 0.37 m in slopes ≥25°. An examination of lidar returns found that ceanothus obstructed laser pulse penetration and few returns reached the ground surface. In areas of ceanothus cover, we conclude that the obstruction of the ground surface contributed to filtering errors, which resulted in mislabeled ground returns and decreased accuracy in bare-earth DEMs. These results have implications for the use of lidar-derived DEMs in areas of ceanothus throughout western North America, and in ecosystems with similar dense shrub cover."
Histogram Curve Matching Approaches for Object-based Image Classification of Land Cover and Land Use,"Toure, Sory I.; Stow, Douglas A.; Weeks, John R.; Kumar, Sunil",pp. 433-440(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000005/art00002;jsessionid=1w7baxt26l7ab.x-ic-live-01,"The classification of image-objects is usually done using parametric statistical measures of central tendency and/or dispersion (e.g., mean or standard deviation). The objectives of this study were to analyze digital number histograms of image objects and evaluate classifications measures exploiting characteristic signatures of such histograms. Two histograms matching classifiers were evaluated and compared to the standard nearest neighbor to mean classifier. An ADS40 airborne multispectral image of San Diego, California was used for assessing the utility of curve matching classifiers in a geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) approach. The classifications were performed with data sets having 0.5 m, 2.5 m, and 5 m spatial resolutions. Results show that histograms are reliable features for characterizing classes. Also, both histogram matching classifiers consistently performed better than the one based on the standard nearest neighbor to mean rule. The highest classification accuracies were produced with images having 2.5 m spatial resolution."
Change Detection and Deformation Analysis in Point Clouds,"Scaioni, Marco; Roncella, Riccardo; Alba, Mario Ivan",pp. 441-455(15),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000005/art00003;jsessionid=1w7baxt26l7ab.x-ic-live-01,"The paper outlines a method to compare two digital surfaces of the same rock face to detect major changes resulting from detached rocks and deformations. A terrestrial laser scanning survey is used for data gathering. After georeferencing, if the cliff has a complex morphology, a 3D segmentation algorithm is applied to split the whole rock surface into more subregions with an almost planar structure. In each subregion the raw point cloud is resampled on a regular grid and multitemporal differences are analyzed. Anomalies in differences, which should be very close to zero if no geometric variations have occurred, are identified with the following purposes: (a) localizing gross changes due to rock detachments, (b) removing global rigid-body displacements, and (c) understanding local cliff deformations. In the case where the rock face is covered by vegetation, this has to be filtered out, e.g., by visual inspection of RGB images co-registered to the point cloud. This paper also describes a procedure to carry out vegetation filtering in automatic way from the analysis of near-infrared images captured by a camera integrated to laser scanner. The application of the full processing pipeline has been tested on a real case study located in the Italian pre-alpine area. Here, after filtering some vegetation, a total rock fall volume of 0.15 m3was detected on a cliff of about 375 m2and within a period of six months."
Classification of Coffee-Forest Landscapes Using Landsat TM Imagery and Spectral Mixture Analysis,"Schmitt-Harsh, Mikaela; Sweeney, Sean P.; Evans, Tom P.",pp. 457-468(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000005/art00004;jsessionid=1w7baxt26l7ab.x-ic-live-01,"This research applies linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA) to a Landsat TM image, and assesses the value of fraction images (green vegetation, shade, soil) and the thermal band (TM-B6) in discriminating shade-grown coffee systems from forests. Four combinations of TM bands and fraction images were compared, and a maximum likelihood algorithm was used to classify five land cover classes: high-density woodlands, low-density woodlands, coffee agroforests, crop / pasturelands, and urban settlements. The classification accuracy of each model combination was assessed using both Kappa analyses and quality and allocation disagreement parameters. Results indicate improvements to classification accuracies following inclusion of TM-B6 and fraction images as inputs to the classification; however, only the use of TM-B6 led to significant improvements at the 95 percent confidence level. The highest classification accuracy achieved was 86 percent (Kstandard= 0.82), with producer’s and user’s accuracy of coffee agroforests reaching 89 percent and 90 percent, respectively, an improvement over previous research aimed at spectrally distinguishing coffee from other woody cover types."
The Influence of Multi-season Imagery on Models of Canopy Cover,"Coulston, John W.; Jacobs, Dennis M.; King, Chris R.; Elmore, Ivey C.",pp. 469-477(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000005/art00005;jsessionid=1w7baxt26l7ab.x-ic-live-01,"Quantifying tree canopy cover in a spatially explicit fashion is important for broad-scale monitoring of ecosystems and for management of natural resources. Researchers have developed empirical models of tree canopy cover to produce geospatial products. For subpixel models, percent tree canopy cover estimates (derived from fi ne-scale imagery) serve as the response variable. The explanatory variables are developed from reflectance values and derivatives, elevation and derivatives, and other ancillary data. However, there is a lack of guidance in the literature regarding the use of leaf-on only imagery versus multi-season imagery for the explanatory variables. We compared models developed from leaf-on only Landsat imagery with models developed from multi-season imagery for a study area in Georgia. There was no statistical difference among models. We suggest that leaf-on imagery is adequate for the development of empirical models of percent tree canopy cover in the Piedmont of the Southeastern United States."
Combining Hyperspectral and Radar Imagery for Mangrove Leaf Area Index Modeling,"Wong, Frankie K.

Simple VI regression model revealed that triangular vegetation index (TVI) and modified chlorophyll absorption ratio index (MCARI) had the best relationship (r2= 0.68) while the commonly-used NDVI had the poorest relationship (r2= 0.017) with LAI. Poor correlation was found between measured LAI and radar parameters. Results from stepwise multiple regression suggested that TVI combined with GLCM-derived angular second moment formed the best model (r2= 0.78) and reduced the estimation error (RMSE) to 0.2. This study has demonstrated that single use of radar parameters cannot effectively map mangrove LAI. Nonetheless, spectral and radar data are complementary to enhance the mapping."
Rational Function Model in Processing Historical Aerial Photographs,"Ma, Ruijin",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000004/art00001;jsessionid=apagc42ht82c1.x-ic-live-03,"A large amount of aerial photographs were acquired early 1900s for various purposes. These aerial photographs provide valuable baseline data for a variety of environmental studies. To be used for analysis together with other data, these photographs need to be referenced to a ground coordinate system. Often large topographical variations in photo ground coverage demand these photographs be orthorectified using photogrammetric methods for acceptable mapping accuracy. However, camera models for these historical photographs are usually unavailable. Additionally, land-cover change over the years makes it a great challenge to collect accurate control points for calculating camera models. This study investigated the rational function model to orthorectify historical aerial photographs. The analysis results suggest that while the linear, the 2ndorder, and the 3rd order RFMs are all able to closely approximate the rigorous frame camera model, the linear RFM is optimal in representing imaging geometries of historical photographs.."

The goal of this paper is to provide an experimental efficiency comparison between graph based SSL algorithms and traditional supervised learning algorithms (e.g., support vector machines) for multispectral image classification. This research shows that SSL algorithms generally outperform supervised learning algorithms in both classification accuracy and anti-noise ability. In the experiments carried out on two data sets (hyperspectral image and Landsat image), the mean overall accuracies (OAs) of supervised learning algorithms are 15 percent and 86 percent, while the mean OAs of SSL algorithms are 26 percent and 99 percent. To overcome the polynomial complexity of SSL algorithms, we also developed a linear-complexity algorithm by employing multivariate Taylor Series Expansion (TSE) and Woodbury Formula."
Applicability of Multi-date Land Cover Mapping using Landsat-5 TM Imagery in the Northeastern US,"MacLean, Meghan Graham; Congalton, Russell G.",pp. 359-368(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000004/art00003;jsessionid=apagc42ht82c1.x-ic-live-03,"In many situations, multi-date image classification improves classification accuracies. However, with improved accuracies comes increased image processing time and effort. This work investigates the circumstances under which multi-date image classification is significantly better than single-date classification using Landsat-5 TM imagery for southeastern New Hampshire. Multiple Landsat images were processed for every three years from 1986 to 2010 and classified using an object-based image analysis approach (OBIA) with a classification and regression tree (CART) technique. Two maps were created for each of the mapping years, one using a single image, and another using multiple images from that year. The multi-date classification process generally performed better than the single-date process. However, the significance of the improvement was primarily dependent on the accuracy of the single-date map. Therefore, if the accuracy of the singledate classification is acceptable, it may not be necessary to perform the multi-date classification."
Pedestrian Network Extraction from Fused Aerial Imagery (Orthoimages) and Laser Imagery (Lidar),"Kasemsuppakorn, Piyawan; Karimi, Hassan A.",pp. 369-379(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000004/art00004;jsessionid=apagc42ht82c1.x-ic-live-03,"A pedestrian network is a topological map that contains the geometric relationship between pedestrian path segments (e.g., sidewalk, crosswalk, footpath), which is needed in a variety of applications, such as pedestrian navigation services. However, current pedestrian networks are not widely available. In an effort to provide an automatic means for creating pedestrian networks, this paper presents a methodology for extracting pedestrian network from aerial and laser images. The methodology consists of data preparation and four steps: object filtering, pedestrian path region extraction, pedestrian network construction, and raster to vector conversion. An experiment, using ten images, was conducted to evaluate the performance of the methodology. Evaluation results indicate that the methodology can extract sidewalk, crosswalk, footpath, and building entrances; it collects pedestrian networks with 61 percent geometrical completeness, 67.35 percent geometrical correctness, 71 percent topological completeness and 51.38 percent topological correctness."
Automatic Camera Calibration in Close Range Photogrammetry,"Fraser, Clive S.",pp. 381-388(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000004/art00005;jsessionid=apagc42ht82c1.x-ic-live-03,"Automatic camera calibration using self-calibration with the aid of coded targets is now very much the norm in close-range photogrammetry. This is irrespective of whether the cameras to be calibrated are high-end metric, or the digital SLRs and consumer-grade models that are increasingly being employed for image-based 3D measurement. Automation has greatly simplified the calibration task, but there are real prospects that important camera calibration issues may be overlooked in what has become an almost black-box operation. This paper discusses the impact of a number of such issues, some of which relate to the functional model adopted for self-calibration, and others to practical aspects which need to be taken into account when pursuing optimal calibration accuracy and integrity. Issues discussed include interior orientation stability, calibration reliability, focal plane distortion, image point distribution, variation in lens distortion with image scale, color imagery and chromatic aberration, and whether 3D object space control is warranted. By appreciating and accounting for these issues, users of automatic camera calibration will enhance the prospect of achieving an optimal recovery of scene-independent camera calibration parameters."

However, little is known about the influence of scanner specifications on derived forest parameters. We compared two TLS systems at two sites in British Columbia. Common scanning benchmarks and identical algorithms were used to obtain estimates of tree diameter, position, and canopy characteristics. Visualization of range images and point clouds showed clear differences, even though both scanners were relatively high-resolution instruments. These translated into quantifiable differences in impulse penetration, characterization of stems and crowns far from the scan location, and gap fraction. Differences between scanners in estimates of effective plant area index were greater than differences between sites. Both scanners provided a detailed digital model of forest structure, and gross structural characterizations (including crown dimensions and position) were relatively robust; but comparison of canopy density metrics may require consideration of scanner attributes."

The proposed hybrid OBCD method was used to update an existing thematic map derived from Landsat-5 and -7 imagery (circa 2000), with imagery consisting of markedly different sensor specifications (Landsat-2, circa 1976). The proposed hierarchical image segmentation strategy successfully constrained change objects within existing land cover boundaries, avoiding the production of “sliver objects,” an issue related to other image segmentation strategies used in OBCD. In combination with the CCA method, the hybrid OBCD method is capable of generating change thresholds for individual land-cover classes, providing a mechanism to limit the amount of spurious change detected. Two change threshold methods were tested: (a) change threshold values based on two standard deviations, and, (b) an unsupervised threshold method. No statistically significant difference was found between these threshold methods."

Previous studies have confirmed the effectiveness of radiometric thresholding in delineating shadows cast by tall buildings on high resolution (≤1m) imagery. Thresholding is not effective when shadow width is comparable to the imaging sensor resolution since mixed shadow/illuminated pixels do not exhibit a distinct radiometric character. A spatial-spectral shadow detection method is proposed that exploits the line-like and low radiance characteristics of shadows cast by large area commercial/industrial buildings commonly found in suburban areas of large cities. Tests conducted in shadow detection of such buildings in Calgary, Alberta using RapidEye imagery indicate that detectability rates of ~80 percent can be achieved although commission errors are significant because of the plethora of other line-like features present in industrial park settings."

Observed global and land-cover specific elevation errors are subsequently compared with an external study where land-cover dependent errors were quantified within four lidar data sets that overlapped the IFSAR DTM validation area. The results of these absolute and comparative results are subsequently used to make recommendations regarding the potential of Intermap bare-earth IFSAR DTM data in environmental modeling applications elsewhere, and the scope for using the data in conjunction with, and as an alternative to airborne lidar data is discussed."

Given the extensive and increasing list of applications a repeatable method for assessing geolocation accuracy would be beneficial. An array of portable lights was designed and taken to multiple field sites known to have no other light sources. The lights were operated during nighttime overpasses by the DMSP OLS and observed in the imagery. An assessment of the geolocation accuracy was performed by measuring the distance between the GPS measured location of the lights and the observed location in the imagery. A systematic shift was observed and the mean distance was measured at 2.9 km."

Spatio-temporal velocity fields in the region of the glacier front were determined from monoscopic terrestrial image sequences recorded by an inter-vallometer mode high-resolution digital camera over several days. In these image sequences, a large number of glacier surface points were tracked by subpixel accuracy feature tracking techniques. Scaling and georeferencing of the trajectories obtained from image space tracking was performed using a multi-station GPS-supported photogrammetric network. The technique allows for tracking hundreds of glacier surface points at a measurement accuracy in the order of one decimeter, for typical glacier movement rates, and an almost arbitrarily high temporal resolution. The results show velocities of up to 16 meters per day."

Besides the conventional mapping missions, lidar has proven to be very useful for a wide spectrum of applications such as forestry, urban planning, structural deformation analysis, and reverse engineering. In the context of a nationwide dataset, it is safe to assume that multiple laser scanners are under different conditions to collect the data. Current registration and segmentation algorithms assume homogeneity in the local point density and accuracy which is an invalid assumption that cannot be tolerated. As a consequence of the wide range of lidar sensors currently available, it is becoming crucial to develop algorithms for the registration and segmentation of lidar data with significantly varying characteristics (i.e., varying point density and accuracy). In this paper, a methodology for the optimal registration and segmentation of heterogeneous lidar data is presented. An example of integrating airborne and terrestrial laser scans is presented and followed by a discussion of the pros of the integration process."

Semantic constraints are introduced to correctly model 3D objects. Three areas from different regions in the Netherlands have been processed in order to develop, improve, and test the automatic generation of a national 3D city and landscape model. Specific attention has been paid to exceptional cases that may occur in a nationwide dataset. Based on the test results, the Kadaster, the national agency in the Netherlands responsible for the production of nation wide geo-information, decided that it is feasible to produce a national 3D city and landscape model that fulfills the specifications that were defined as part of this study. Future research is identified to make the results further ready for practice."

The Canadian Consortium for Lidar Environmental Applications Research (C-CLEAR) has supported almost 200 projects across Canada since 2000, with forest-related studies being a dominant theme. In 2010 and 2011, field operations were mobilized to support 13 ALS projects spanning almost the full longitudinal gradient of Canada’s forests. This paper presents case studies for seven plus an overview of some best practices and data processing workflow tools that have resulted from these consortium activities. Although the projects and research teams are spread across Canada, the coordination and decade of experience provided through C-CLEAR have brought common methodological elements to all. It is clear that operational, analytical and reporting guidelines that adhere to community accepted standards are required if the benefits promised by ALS forestry are to be realized. A national Lidar Institute that builds upon the C-CLEAR model and focuses on developing standards, guidelines, and certified training would address this need."
Towards Integration of GLAS into a National Fuel Mapping Program,"Peterson, Birgit; Nelson, Kurtis; Wylie, Bruce",pp. 175-183(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000002/art00004;jsessionid=nix2qamettks.x-ic-live-02,"Comprehensive canopy structure and fuel data are critical for understanding and modeling wildland fire. The LANDFIRE project produces such data nationwide based on a collection of field observations, Landsat imagery, and other geospatial data. Where field data are not available, alternate strategies are being investigated. In this study, vegetation structure data available from GLAS were used to fill this data gap for the Yukon Flats Ecoregion of interior Alaska. The GLAS-derived structure and fuel layers and the original LANDFIRE layers were subsequently used as inputs into a fire behavior model to determine what effect the revised inputs would have on the model outputs. The outputs showed that inclusion of the GLAS data enabled better landscape-level characterization of vegetation structure and therefore enabled a broader wildland fire modeling capability. The results of this work underscore how GLAS data can be incorporated into LANDFIRE canopy structure and fuel mapping."
A Multi-Scale Approach to Mapping Canopy Height,"Green, Gordon M.; Ahearn, Sean C.; Ni-Meister, Wenge",pp. 185-194(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000002/art00005;jsessionid=nix2qamettks.x-ic-live-02,"Mapping vegetation height over large areas presents a problem of scale: height varies with the individual tree or stand, but the resolution of available datasets is too low to characterize this variability sufficiently for many applications. We address this problem by fusing 1 km resolution canopy height data derived from satellite-based laser altimetry with higher-resolution land-cover data, resulting in 30 m resolution estimates of canopy height. These are downscaled further to 1 m resolution by simulating individual trees. A web service architecture is used, which allows processing to occur on demand without preprocessing large datasets. We compared the resulting canopy volumes to reference airborne lidar data from 262 randomly located 1 km2areas within nine study sites. Results at 30 m resolution show an RMSE of 33 percent of the mean reference volume and an R2of 0.77; at 1 m the RMSE is 66 percent and the R2is 0.38."
New Approaches for Estimating the Local Point Density and its Impact on Lidar Data Segmentation,"Lari, Zahra; Habib, Ayman",pp. 195-207(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000002/art00006;jsessionid=nix2qamettks.x-ic-live-02,"Lidar systems have been proven as a cost-effective tool for the collection of high density and accurate point cloud over physical surfaces. The collected point cloud does not exhibit homogenous point distribution due to the characteristics of the scanning system and/or the physical properties of the scanned surfaces. In order to effectively process the lidar point clouds, local point density variations should be quantified and taken into account for the definition of processing parameters. In this paper, new approaches are presented for the estimation of local point density indices while considering the 3D relationship among lidar points, the physical properties of the reflecting surfaces, and the noise level in the datasets collected by different laser scanners. The impact of considering the estimated local point density variations on the quality of lidar data segmentation results is then investigated by performing a quality control procedure. Quantitative evaluation of segmentation results highlights the efficacy of utilizing the estimated local point density indices for the derivation of more accurate segmentation."

Our compressed LAZ files are only 7 to 25 percent of the original size. Our encoding and decoding speeds are several million points per second on average desktop computers. Compression is streaming and decompression supports random-access. A reference implementation with a LGPL license is available at http://laszip.org.On a national scale, the compression savings of storing LAZ instead of LAS can be measured in Petabytes of data, i.e., data that no longer need to be hosted, backed up, and served for download.

Spatio-statistical Predictions of Vernal Pool Locations in Massachusetts,"Cormier, Tina A.; Congalton, Russell G.; Babbitt, Kimberly J.",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000001/art00001;jsessionid=ryzut6qgslyq.x-ic-live-01,"Vernal pools are small, isolated, depressions that experience cyclical periods of inundation and drying. Many species have evolved strategies to utilize the unique characteristics of vernal pools; however, their small size, seasonal nature, and isolation from other, larger water bodies, suggest increased risk of damage or loss by development. The objectives of this research were to statistically determine physical predictors of vernal pool presence, and subsequently, to represent the output cartographically for use as a conservation tool. Logistic regression and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) methods were used to identify important predictors of 405 known vernal pools across northeastern Massachusetts. The CART models performed most favorably, achieving map accuracies as high as 97 percent and providing a set of rules for vernal pool prediction. It is important to note that we observed significant discrepancies between model accuracy and map accuracy, illustrating the pitfall of relying on statistical metrics alone (e.g., R2values) to assess the quality of spatial analyses."
"Predicting Surface Fuel Models and Fuel Metrics Using Lidar and CIR Imagery in a Dense, Mountainous Forest","Jakubowksi, Marek K.; Guo, Qinghua; Collins, Brandon; Stephens, Scott; Kelly, Maggi",pp. 37-49(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000001/art00002;jsessionid=ryzut6qgslyq.x-ic-live-01,"We compared the ability of several classification and regression algorithms to predict forest stand structure metrics and standard surface fuel models. Our study area spans a dense, topographically complex Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forest. We used clustering, regression trees, and support vector machine algorithms to analyze high density (average 9 pulses/m2), discrete return, small-footprint lidar data, along with multispectral imagery. Stand structure metric predictions generally decreased with increased canopy penetration. For example, from the top of canopy, we predicted canopy height (r2=0.87), canopy cover (r2=0.83), basal area (r2=0.82), shrub cover (r2=0.62), shrub height (r2=0.59), combined fuel loads (r2=0.48), and fuel bed depth (r2=0.35). While the general fuel types were predicted accurately, specific surface fuel model predictions were poor (76 percent and<50 percent correct classification, respectively) using all algorithms. These fuel components are critical inputs for wildfire behavior modeling, which ultimately support forest management decisions. This comprehensive examination of the relative utility of lidar and optical imagery will be useful for forest science and management."
Improved Nonsubsampled Contourlet Transform for Multi-sensor Image Registration,"Wang, Ruirui; Ma, Jianwen; Huang, Huaguo; Shi, Wei",pp. 51-66(16),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000001/art00003;jsessionid=ryzut6qgslyq.x-ic-live-01,"Homologous feature point extraction is a key problem in the multi-sensor image registration. In this paper, a new feature point extraction method using nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) and an adaptive shrink operator (ASO_NSCT) for multi-sensor image registration is proposed. Moreover, this proposed feature matching is different from the traditional feature matching strategies and is performed using a similarity measure computed from neighborhood circles in low-frequency bands. Then, a number of reliable matched couples with even distributions are obtained, which assures the accuracy of the registration. Applications of the proposed algorithm to different optical images as well as optical and synthetic aperture radar images show that, in each case, a large number of accurate matched couples could be identified. Additionally, the RMSE patterns are analyzed and comparisons of the parameters are carried out between the registration models and the actual ground structures, which further demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

Both aircraft velocity and attitude instability are taken into account in modeling image motion. Effects of aircraft pitch, roll, and yaw on image motion are analyzed based on geometric relations in designated coordinate systems. The image motion is mathematically modeled by image motion velocity multiplied by exposure time. Quantitative analysis to image motion velocity is then conducted in simulation experiments. The results have shown that image motion caused by aircraft velocity is space invariant while image motion caused by aircraft attitude instability is more complicated. Pitch, roll, and yaw all contribute to image motion to different extents. Pitch dominates the along-track image motion and both roll and yaw greatly contribute to the cross-track image motion. These results provide a valuable base for image motion compensation to ensure high accuracy imagery in aerial photogrammetry."
Using Optical Projection in Close-range Photogrammetry for 6DOF Sensor Positioning,"Zheng, Benrui; Dong, Yue; Davies, Angela; Mullany, Brigid; Morse, Edward",pp. 79-86(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2013/00000079/00000001/art00005;jsessionid=ryzut6qgslyq.x-ic-live-01,"A novel, low cost, non-contact, six degrees of freedom (DOF) measurement technique is proposed that enables real-time measurement of a small lightweight module’s location. Straight forward applications of the proposed technique include robot calibration by installing the module to the end effector of a robot arm, and head-tracking in a typical virtual reality environment by attaching the module to a human head. The technique is based on a combination of photogrammetry and optical pattern projection. The module generates an optical pattern that is observable on the surrounding walls, and photogrammetry is used to measure the absolute coordinates of features in the projected optical pattern with respect to a defined global coordinate system. By combining these absolute coordinates with the known angular information of the optical projection beams, a minimization algorithm can be used to extract the absolute coordinates and angular orientation of the module itself. Experimental agreement of 1 to 5 parts in 103was obtained by translating the module over 0.9 m and by rotating it through 60°. Numerical simulations were conducted to demonstrate that optimum design of the projected pattern gives a lower associated measurement uncertainty than is possible by direct photogrammetric measurement with traditional tie points. This paper documents the proof of principle and describes how the measurement can be further improved."

A Piecewise Catenary Curve Model Growing for 3D Power Line Reconstruction,"Jwa, Yoonseok; Sohn, Gunho",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000012/art00001;jsessionid=1gdxygo94i920.x-ic-live-03,"The three-dimensional (3D) modeling of power lines is one of the most critical processing steps for identifying vegetation encroachment on high-voltage power lines, which often results in electrical shock hazards, fires, and outages, as well as verifying the current capacity of existing power lines and thus supplying the increasing demand for electricity. Today’s state-of-the art techniques are used to reconstruct power line models, however, still require human intervention to a certain extent, which hinders the rapid response needed for effectively managing power line risks. We propose an alternative solution to automate the procedures to reconstruct a 3D power line model from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data. The proposed method starts by extracting power line candidate points, which are converted into a catenary curve model representing a power line. This initial model is allowed to progressively grow to produce a complete power line model by producing hypothetical growing models and selecting optimal one. A stochastic constrained non-linear adjustment method is developed for estimating catenary curve model parameters. An evaluation of the proposed approach over a complex power line scene demonstrates that the proposed method is promising for automatically reconstructing 3D power line model from ALS data, and thus provides benefits for efficient and reliable power line risk management."
Application of Lidar Terrain Surfaces for Soil Moisture Modeling,"Southee, Florence Margaret; Treitz, Paul M.; Scott, Neal A.",pp. 1241-1251(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000012/art00002;jsessionid=1gdxygo94i920.x-ic-live-03,"Soil moisture gradients and nutrient fertility are used to classify forest types in Ontario, Canada based on ecological land classification (ELC). An existing lidar dataset for the Romeo Malette Forest near Timmins, Ontario was used to derive three terrain indices (topographic wetness index (TWI), percent elevation index (PEI), and canopy height model (CHM)) at varying resolutions (2 m, 5 m, 10 m and 20 m) to determine the resolution that best characterizes soil moisture patterns in a boreal forest landscape. Depression removal algorithms were examined to determine how they affect the TWI, and thus, soil moisture estimation. This paper stresses the importance of gathering data at a resolution that is sufficient for mapping fine-scale basin features to accurately model soil moisture in forested environments. The results of this research indicate that 5 m resolution data provided the best overall relationship with measured seasonal soil moisture. More generally, the results indicate that high spatial resolution variables (i.e., 2 m, 5 m) may be more suited to modeling soil moisture trends at shallow depths (0 to 15 cm), while coarser resolutions (i.e., 10 m, 20 m) may be more adept at resolving trends over greater depths (0 to 40 cm)."
A Semi-Analytical Model for the Multitemporal Prediction of Chlorophyll-ain an Iowa Lake Using Hyperion Data,"Sugumaran, Ramanathan; Thomas, Justin",pp. 1253-1260(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000012/art00003;jsessionid=1gdxygo94i920.x-ic-live-03,"The aim of this study was to use an analytical approach to monitor water quality in an Iowa lake using multitemporal Hyperion satellite imagery. Cloud-free hyperspectral images were acquired from the Hyperion sensor on individual days in June, July, and August of 2006. Water samples with accurate locations using GPS were collected simultaneously with image acquisition. Water samples were analyzed for various water quality constituents. Chlorophyll-a (CHL), was estimated for each sampling date using a bio-optical model with Specific Inherent Optical Properties (SIOPs) of the lake and light field variables derived from a radiative transfer numerical model. The model was then applied to the Hyperion images to create spatially continuous CHL maps for the study area every month. These results were compared with traditional linear regression model outputs. Maps produced using the bio-optical model effectively demonstrated spatial and temporal variability of CHL for the lake. The CHL concentration from this model across the lake ranged from 28 to 121μg/L for the month of June, 18 to 111μg/L for July, and 31 to 125μg/L for August. The validation and accuracy assessment for the bio-optical model with in-situ data showed R2values of 0.90978, 0.96794 and 0.93057 for June, July, and August, respectively, and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient values of 0.499478, 0.733072, and 0.878757 for June, July, and August, respectively."
Determination of Optimum Classifier and Feature Subset in Hyperspectral Images based on Ant Colony System,"Samadzadegan, Farhad; Hasani, Hadiseh; Schenk, Toni",pp. 1261-1273(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000012/art00004;jsessionid=1gdxygo94i920.x-ic-live-03,"Recent advances in hyperspectral remote sensing technology allow the discrimination of complex land-cover classes that have similar spectral reflectance. The reliability and robustness of Support Vector Machines (SVM) in high dimensional space makes it an efficient tool for the classification of hyperspectral images. However, two optimization issues have a strong effect on the SVM performance: optimum parameter determination and optimum feature subset selection. There is an intricate relationship between these two issues, and we propose in this paper to determine the SVM parameters and the feature subset simultaneously by Ant Colony System (ACS). We compare our approach with three powerful meta-heuristic optimization algorithms, namely, Simulated Annealing (SA), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Bees Algorithm (BA). Experimental results with two AVIRIS datasets clearly demonstrate the superiority of the ACS algorithm in that it improves the classification accuracy and decreases the size of the selected feature subset. In both datasets the classification accuracy improves by about 7 percent and 95 redundant bands are eliminated."
Automated Delineation of Individual Tree Crowns from Lidar Data by Multi-Scale Analysis and Segmentation,"Jing, Linhai; Hu, Baoxin; Li, Jili; Noland, Thomas",pp. 1275-1284(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000012/art00005;jsessionid=1gdxygo94i920.x-ic-live-03,"A canopy height model (CHM) derived from lidar data can be segmented to obtain individual tree crowns. However, branches, tree crowns, and tree clusters usually have similar shapes and overlapping sizes. This causes current individual tree crown delineation methods for CHMs to work less effectively on closed canopy deciduous or mixed wood forests consisting of various-sized tree crowns. Based on mult-scale analysis and segmentation, an innovative tree crown delineation method was developed in this study. In this method, the scale levels of target tree crowns are first morphologically determined; the CHM is filtered at the multiple scale levels; and local maxima within each filtered CHM are taken as markers to segment the original CHM using the marker-controlled watershed method. After tree crown segments are selected from the multiple resulting segmentation maps and integrated together, a complete tree crown map is generated. In an experiment on natural forests in Ontario, Canada, the proposed method yielded crown maps having a good consistency with manual and visual interpretation. For instance, when compared to a manually delineated forest map, the automated method correctly delineated about 69 percent, 65 percent, and 73 percent of the tree crowns from plots of closed canopy coniferous, deciduous, and mixed wood forests, respectively."

The errors between a set of photogrammetrically-derived measurements on a clinical mannequin with those made by an experienced nursing sister were found to be negligible (less than 0.5 mm) at the 5 percent level of significance. The four cameras were individually calibrated and the parameters and distortion patterns compared. To assess the impact of camera calibration, the validation imagery was also processed with both average and nominal calibration parameter sets. It was found that the average parameter set produced measurement errors similar to those produced by the individual calibrations, but using the nominal calibration set produced less accurate measurements. The project demonstrates that a low-cost photogrammetric system is as accurate as manual measurements and at the same time provides a safe, non-contact measurement environment and a visual record of the subjects."

The photorealistic modeling of large-scale real world scenes such as urban environments has become increasingly interesting to the vision, graphics, and photogrammetry communities. In this paper, we present an automatic approach to window and facade detection from mobile lidar data. The proposed method combines bottom-up with top-down strategies to extract facade planes from noisy lidar point clouds. The window detection is achieved through a two-step approach: potential window point detection and window localization. The facade pattern is automatically inferred to enhance the robustness of the window detection. Experimental results on six datasets result in 71.2 percent and 88.9 percent in the first two datasets, 100 percent for the rest four datasets in terms of completeness rate, and 100 percent correctness rate for all the tested datasets, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution for planar facades with rectilinear windows. The application potential includes generation of building facade models with street-level details and texture synthesis for producing realistic occlusion-free facade texture."

A representative seamline is extracted as follows. First, the straight skeleton of the overlapping area of adjacent images is extracted. Second, vector roads in the overlapping regions are overlaid with the extracted skeleton to build a weighted graph G (V, E). Dijkstra’s algorithm is applied to find the lowest-cost path that connects two intersections of the polygons of two adjacent images. The lowest-cost path is considered as a seamline candidate. Finally, the seamline candidate is refined by considering its surrounding pixels. The refined seamline is employed as the final seamline. The resultant seamlines commonly follow the centerlines of roads as much as possible, and the mosaic image appears more seamless. Moreover, the vector-based approach is typically more efficient than the existing raster-based approaches: the vector-based approach is nearly ten times faster than a raster–based representative."

Brightness temperatures at 3.9[H9262]m, and 11[H9262]m channels (BT 3.9, and BT 11, respectively) and differences of brightness temperatures between 3.9[H9262]m and 4.0[H9262]m, and between 11[H9262]m and 12[H9262]m (BT 3.9-BT 4.0, and BT 11-BT 12, respectively) are used to identify nighttime water pixels by a support vector machines (SVM) classifier. Prominent flood locations are detected by a change detection process using a reference water-land map. To test the effectiveness of the proposed method, two flood cases caused by heavy rains were chosen as trial scenarios. The nighttime mapping results are validated with the flood maps, which are obtained from the visual interpretation based on the daytime flood identification results. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is effective for the delineation of inundated areas with standing water during the nighttime."

Motivated by the dramatically improved potential of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM), this paper describes a different approach for water constituent retrieval where both thermal and visible spectral bands of the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM [H11001]) instrument on board Landsat-7 are utilized. In this effort, Landsat data is integrated with a 3D hydrodynamic model to obtain profiles of particles and dissolved matter in the near shore zone in the vicinity of two river discharges. The procedure is based upon performing many hydrodynamic simulations by adjusting input environmental/physical variables and generating Look-Up-Tables (LUTs). The best match, obtained using optimization, demonstrated an average root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of 0.68 percent, i.e., 0.0068 reflectance units, calculated over the two river plumes. It is concluded that calibrating a physics-based model using the Landsat-7 imagery can provide a more lucid insight into the dynamics of spatially non-uniform waters."
Automatic Generation of 2.5D Terrain Models without Occluding Routes of Interest,"Deng, Hao; Zhang, Liqiang; Ma, Jingtao; Zhang, Liang; Chen, Dong",pp. 1175-1185(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000011/art00005;jsessionid=3hcmklkb8btha.x-ic-live-01,"When a car drives in mountainous regions, the views based on conventional perspective projection often suffer from features of interest being occluded. We propose a method for generating disocclusion views in mountainous regions. The terrain is segmented to build a potential set of occluders; and then an optimized viewpoint is determined, and elevations are rearranged. To obtain a smooth deformed terrain, a smooth displacement function is introduced to deform the level-of-detail terrain models. Compared with previous methods, the merit of this study lies in automatically generating disocclusion views with temporal coherence, while keeping the details of the deformed terrain the same as the original terrain. Experiments performed on the 4098 pixel 4098 pixel mountainous terrain landscape prove that the disocclusion views can achieve 42 to 58 frames/second. Moreover, the shapes of the features of interest on the driving route without occlusion and the spatial configuration of geographical landmarks in its neighborhood can be easily recognized."
A Supervised and Fuzzy-based Approach to Determine Optimal Multi-resolution Image Segmentation Parameters,"Tong, Hengjian; Maxwell, Travis; Zhang, Yun; Dey, Vivek",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000010/art00001;jsessionid=3ogdwj7pek4vk.x-ic-live-03,"Image segmentation is important for object-based classification. One of the most advanced image segmentation techniques is multi-resolution segmentation implemented by eCognition®. Multi-resolution segmentation requires users to determine a set of proper segmentation parameters through a trial-and-error process. To achieve accurate segmentations of objects of different sizes, several sets of segmentation parameters are required: one for each level. However, the trial-and-error process is time consuming and operator dependent. To overcome these problems, this paper introduces a supervised and fuzzy-based approach to determine optimal segmentation parameters for eCognition®. This approach is referred to as the Fuzzy-based Segmentation Parameter optimizer (FBSP optimizer) in this paper. It is based on the idea of discrepancy evaluation to control the merging of sub-segments to reach a target segment. Experiments demonstrate that the approach improves the segmentation accuracy by more than 16 percent, reduces the operation time from two hours to one-half hour, and is operator independent."
Automated Georegistration of High-Resolution Satellite Imagery using a RPC Model with Airborne Lidar Information,"Oh, Jaehong; Lee, Changno; Eo, Yangdam; Bethel, James",pp. 1045-1056(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000010/art00002;jsessionid=3ogdwj7pek4vk.x-ic-live-03,"A large amount high-resolution satellite imagery (HRSI) has been available in the commercial market because of its value in creating accurate base maps for various applications. As massive amounts of HRSI are acquired globally by satellites with short revisit times, automated but accurate georegistration is still required despite advances in precise orbit tracking and estimation. Motivated by the attractive properties of airborne lidar data, such as their high resolution and accuracy, this study proposes a new automated method for refining the HRSI with rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs) using airborne lidar information. By projecting the lidar intensity return into the HRSI space, the image matching complexity is reduced to a simple, 2D case. The true challenge is in overcoming the difference between the HRSI and the lidar intensity return to allow for reliable matching. To this end, this paper proposes a new method based on simple relative edge cross correlation (RECC) with a screening method to prevent false matching. To make the approach more robust, data snooping was added for a final detection of outliers. Experiments were performed using three Kompsat-2 images and the potential of the approach was confirmed, showing sub-pixel accuracy."
Generation of a U.S. National Urban Land-Use Product,"Falcone, James A.; Homer, Collin G.",pp. 1057-1068(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000010/art00003;jsessionid=3ogdwj7pek4vk.x-ic-live-03,"Characterization of urban land uses is essential for many applications. However, differentiating among thematicallydetailed urban land uses (residential, commercial, industrial, institutional, recreational, etc.) over broad areas is challenging, in part because image-based solutions are not ideal for establishing the contextual basis for identifying economic function and use. At present no current United States national-scale mapping exists for urban land uses similar to the classical Anderson Level II classification. This paper describes a product that maps urban land uses, and is linked to and corresponds with the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2006. In this product, NLCD urban pixels, in addition to their current imperviousness intensity classification, are assigned one of nine urban use classes based on information drawn from multiple data sources. These sources include detailed infrastructure information, population characteristics, and historical land use. The result is a method for creating a 30 m national-scale grid providing thematically-detailed urban land use information which complements the NLCD. Initial results for 10 major metropolitan areas are provided as an on-line link. Accuracy assessment of initial products yielded an overall accuracy of 81.6 percent."
A Flexible Mathematical Method for Camera Calibration in Digital Aerial Photogrammetry,"Tang, Rongfu; Fritsch, Dieter; Cramer, Michael; Schneider, Werner",pp. 1069-1077(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000010/art00004;jsessionid=3ogdwj7pek4vk.x-ic-live-03,"Self-calibration plays a significant role in the automatic interior/exterior orientation of camera systems. This paper presents a new family of self-calibration additional parameters (APs) for digital airborne camera calibration. Photogrammetric self-calibration can (to a very large extent) be considered as a function approximation problem in mathematics. Based on the rigorous approximation theory, a new family of so-calledLegendre self-calibration APsis developed from the orthogonal Legendre Polynomials. An approach is suggested to assess the full potential of in-situ camera calibration. The performance of Legendre APs is investigated in many field tests on the DMC, UltracamX, UltracamXp and DigiCAM camera systems. The external accuracy in the tests can reach 0.2 GSD and 0.4 GSD in horizontal and vertical dimensions, respectively. The posterior standard deviation estimation of image measurements is approx. 0.12 pixel or even less. The advantages of Legendre APs are illustrated over the conventional counterparts. From both the theoretical and practical views, Legendre APs are orthogonal, rigorous, flexible, and effective for calibrating frame-format airborne cameras."
Mapping Individual Tree Species in an Urban Forest Using Airborne Lidar Data and Hyperspectral Imagery,"Zhang, Caiyun; Qiu, Fang",pp. 1079-1087(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000010/art00005;jsessionid=3ogdwj7pek4vk.x-ic-live-03,"We developed a neural network based approach to identify urban tree species at the individual tree level from lidar and hyperspectral imagery. This approach is capable of modeling the characteristics of multiple spectral signatures within each species using an internally unsupervised engine, and is able to catch spectral differences between species using an externally supervised system. To generate a species-level map for an urban forest with high spatial heterogeneity and species diversity, we conducted a treetop-based species identification. This can avoid the problems of double-sided illumination, shadow, and mixed pixels, encountered in the crown-based species classification. The study indicates lidar data in conjunction with hyperspectral imagery are not only capable of detecting individual trees and estimating their tree metrics, but also identifying their species types using the developed algorithm. The integration of these two data sources has great potential to take the place of traditional field surveys."
Operational Utilization of Aerial Multispectral Remote Sensing during Oil Spill Response,"Svejkovsky, Jan; Lehr, William; Muskat, Judd; Graettinger, George; Mullin, Joseph",pp. 1089-1102(14),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000010/art00006;jsessionid=3ogdwj7pek4vk.x-ic-live-03,"A rapidly deployable aerial multispectral sensor utilizing four channels in the visible-near-IR and one channel in the thermal IR was developed along with processing software to identify oil-on-water and map its spatial extents and thickness distribution patterns. Following validation over natural oil seeps and at Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement’s (BSEE’s) Ohmsett test tank, the system was utilized operationally on a near-daily basis for three months during the Deepwater Horizon (MC-252) spill in the Gulf of Mexico in summer 2010. Digital, GIS-compatible analyses were produced and disseminated following each flight mission. The analysis products were utilized for a multitude of response activities including daily offshore oil recovery planning, oil trajectory modeling, dispersant application effect documentation, beached oil mapping and documentation of the relative oil amount along the spill’s offshore perimeter. The system’s prime limitation was its relatively narrow imaging footprint and low sun angle requirement to minimize sunglint, both of which limited the total area that could be imaged each day. This paper discusses the system’s various applications as well as limitations that were encountered during its use in the Deepwater Horizon incident."
Evaluating the Benefits of Octree-based Indexing for Lidar Data,"Mosa, Abu Saleh Mohammad; Schön, Bianca; Bertolotto, Michela; Laefer, Debra F.",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000009/art00001;jsessionid=gjis8m6t4ffc3.x-ic-live-01,"Very large three-dimensional (3D) point datasets are increasingly common, such as from Light Detection and Ranging (lidar). Increasingly, there are attempts to exploit these 3D point data sets beyond mere visualization. However, current Spatial Information Systems provide only limited 3D support. Even commercial systems advertising in-built, 3D data types provide only minimal functionality. Specifically, there is no effective means of indexing large 3D point datasets, which is crucial for efficient analysis and engineering use. Also, many datasets are information rich (e.g., contain color or some other associated semantic information), which has yet to be fully exploited. This paper presents the implementation in a commercial spatial database of a spatial indexing technique using an octree data structure and highlights its advantages for sparse, as well as uniformly distributed, aerial lidar data. The implementation outperforms an existing r-tree index within the software, and offers additional functionality of attributebased 3D grouping."

In this study, the RUSLE model was used to evaluate soil erosion risk based on soil samples, a soil type map, digital elevation model (DEM) data, and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify major factors influencing soil erosion risks. A regression model based on DEM-derived slope gradient and TM-derived fractional soil and vegetation images was developed to map soil erosion risk distribution in a forest ecosystem in Zhejiang, China. The developed method has the potential to quickly examine spatial distribution of soil erosion risks. This study provides a new insight for evaluating soil erosion risks in forest ecosystems with the integration of remote sensing and GIS."
A Variational Gradient-based Fusion Method for Visible and SWIR Imagery,"Li, Huifang; Zhang, Liangpei; Shen, Huanfeng; Li, Pingxiang",pp. 947-958(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000009/art00003;jsessionid=gjis8m6t4ffc3.x-ic-live-01,"This paper presents a new variational gradient-based fusion method for visible and short-wave infrared (SWIR) imagery. The proposed method enables spatial enhancement and dehazing of visible imagery. Integrating gradients from SWIR imagery into visible imagery produces a single image with true color and sharp gradients. A constraint based on band correlation is included to improve the enhancement and implement dehazing. The band correlation is according to the quantitative relationship between the wavelength and the atmospheric effect caused by Rayleigh scattering. In this study, both clear and hazy Landsat ETM[H11001] images are used in the experiments. By visual assessment, the gradient of the fused image is more salient than that of the original image, and the true color is well preserved. With the inclusion of the band correlation constraint, the proposed fusion method yields almost haze-free results. Quantitatively, the Metric Q of the fused images is significantly higher than that of the original images; the largest increase of the Metric Q in the experimental results is from 0.0114 to 0.0611. Moreover, for the results of the proposed method, the Metric Q increase in the visible bands declines from blue band to red band."

This paper describes a novel system for semi-automatic quality control of existing topographic geo-spatial data via automatic image analysis. The goal is to reduce the manual effort for quality control of a GIS database to a minimum. The core of the system is a semantic network in which different image analysis operators can be included. The image analysis operators are created for specific applications, i.e., the quality control of specific object classes which are most relevant. Images which can be used in the system are aerial images, high-resolution satellite imagery, and low-resolution satellite imagery. A prototype of the system has been in use for several years at public mapping organizations. From the experience gained during this time, we give a detailed report on the system performance and an evaluation of the results."
Topographic Corrections of Satellite Data for Regional Monitoring,"Goslee, Sarah C.",pp. 973-981(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000009/art00005;jsessionid=gjis8m6t4ffc3.x-ic-live-01,"The increased availability of satellite imagery has made regional monitoring programs possible. To compare images taken at different times, variation in reflectance caused by the interaction of sun position and topography must be corrected. Previous studies of topographic correction methods have often used only single scenes taken under good conditions, and even then have found mixed effects. Six correction methods were tested on two Landsat scenes (TM and ETM +) in central Pennsylvania obtained at low, medium, and high solar elevations. The effects of the corrections on band reflectance values and two ratio-based vegetation indices were assessed. Lambertian methods should not be used for regional monitoring of vegetation: these corrections are not band-specific, and thus do not remove topographic effects on vegetation indices. Instead, non-Lambertian methods such as the c-correction or Minnaert methods, particularly cover-based modifications of the latter, should be used. No methods provide effective correction under conditions of low or negative illumination, though such conditions are often found. An integrated approach including atmospheric corrections may offer a way to reduce topographic effects even at low illumination."
Bundle Block Adjustment of Weakly Connected Aerial Imagery,"Zhang, Yongjun; Xiong, Xiaodong; Shen, Xiang; Ji, Zheng",pp. 983-989(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000009/art00006;jsessionid=gjis8m6t4ffc3.x-ic-live-01,"In aerial photogrammetry of island and reef areas, traditional aerial triangulation cannot be performed because many images in the block are partially or even completely covered by water, and thus there are not enough tie points among adjacent images. To solve this problem, an effective algorithm of position and orientation system (POS) integrated bundle block adjustment is proposed. The exterior orientation parameters of each image are modeled as functions of corresponding POS observations and their estimated systematic errors. A POS integrated bundle adjustment model is designed with the purpose of effectively eliminating the systematic errors of inertial measurement unit observations. Experimental results of three sets of island aerial images show that the proposed approach can compensate for the systematic errors of POS observations effectively. The topo-graphic mapping requirements of hilly terrain at 1:2 000 scale can be fulfilled, provided that at least one ground control point is used in the bundle adjustment."
Objects-based Image Analysis for Mapping Natura 2000 Habitats to Improve Forest Management,"Hernando, Ana; Arroyo, Lara A.; Velázquez, Javier; Tejera, Rosario",pp. 991-999(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000009/art00007;jsessionid=gjis8m6t4ffc3.x-ic-live-01,"Natura 2000 is a European network of protected areas established under the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC). According to the Habitats Directive, habitat maps must be periodically updated, which requires the development of cost- and time-efficient mapping practices. In this study, we propose a methodology for habitat mapping using very high spatial resolution (QuickBird) images with Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA). We classified five segmentation levels: level 5 incorporated the prior knowledge of the study area into the analysis; level 4 and 1 were used to identify arable areas and land covers, respectively. The information contained in levels 1, 4, and 5 was then combined to classify plant species in level 2. Finally, habitats were classified in level 3 using level 2 class-related features. The habitat map obtained had an overall accuracy of 86.3 percent. Classification accuracies were higher for tree-and pasture-dominated habitats than for shrub-dominated habitats."
Phenology-based Crop Classification Algorithm and its Implications on Agricultural Water Use Assessments in California’s Central Valley,"Zhong, Liheng; Gong, Peng; Biging, Greg S.",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000008/art00001;jsessionid=1x3rfmbgnx24e.x-ic-live-03,"The overarching goal of this study was to map specific crop types in the Central Valley, California and estimate the effect of classification uncertainty on the calculation of crop evapotranspiration (ETc). A phenology-based classification (PBC) approach was developed to identify crop types based on phenological and spectral metrics derived from the time series of Landsat TM/ETM+ imagery. Phenological metrics, calculated by fitting asymmetric double sigmoid functions to temporal profiles of enhanced vegetation index (EVI), were capable of separating crop types with distinct crop calendars. An innovative method was used to compute spectral metrics to represent crops’ spectral characteristics at certain phenological stages instead of any specific imaging date. Crop mapping using these metrics showed a stable performance without influences of low-quality data and inter-annual differences in imaging dates. The requirement for ground reference data by the PBC approach was low because classification algorithms were mostly built according to the knowledge on crop calendars and agricultural practices. Techniques including image segmentation, data fusion with MODIS imagery, and decision tree were incorporated to make the approach effective and efficient. Though moderate accuracy (ε65.0 percent) was achieved, ETc calculated by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) 56 method showed that the estimate of water use was not likely to be significantly affected by the classification error in PBC. All these advantages imply the strength of the PBC approach in the regular crop mapping of the Central Valley."
"Mapping Crop Types, Irrigated Areas, and Cropping Intensities in Heterogeneous Landscapes of Southern India Using Multi-Temporal Medium-Resolution Imagery","Heller, Elizabeth; Rhemtulla, Jeanine M.; Lele, Sharachchandra; Kalacska, Margaret; Badiger, Shrinivas; Sengupta, Raja; Ramankutty, Navin",pp. 815-827(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000008/art00002;jsessionid=1x3rfmbgnx24e.x-ic-live-03,"In regions of water scarcity, mapping individual crops, cropping intensities and irrigation can contribute significantly to understanding agricultural water use. But such mapping is challenging in landscapes dominated by small-scale traditional agricultural land holdings with high spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Here, we assessed the benefit of using multi-temporal 24 m resolution LISS-III imagery to characterize cropping systems in the Malaprabha basin of southern India. We used hierarchical stacked supervised classification to create three increasingly detailed maps showing: (a) single rainfed paddy rice versus continuously irrigated sugarcane, (b) irrigated versus rainfed areas, and (c) multiple cropping. Although increasing detail was accompanied by decreasing overall accuracies (89 percent, 74.6 percent and 60.1 percent respectively), using multi-temporal imagery out-performed single imagery alone in all cases. Results also led to higher estimates of total (69.8 percent) and irrigated (34.7 percent) cropland than previous single-imagery studies and census data, revealing the high uncertainty in crop estimates in this region."
A Shape-matching Cropping Index (CI) Mapping Method to Determine Agricultural Cropland Intensities in China using MODIS Time-series Data,"Liu, Jianhong; Zhu, Wenquan; Cui, Xuefeng",pp. 829-837(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000008/art00003;jsessionid=1x3rfmbgnx24e.x-ic-live-03,"As an important indicator of cropping intensity, Cropping Index (CI) is defined as the number of peaks in the Vegetation Index (VI) time-series curve in a year. The existing CI mapping algorithms (e.g., the cross-fitting and the second order difference algorithm) are vulnerable to noise contained in the VI time series and need a priori knowledge and some extra constraints which could not be directly derived from the VI time-series data. In this paper, a shape-matching method is developed which can map CI directly from the preprocessed VI time-series data without the de-noising processes. This shape-matching method utilizes a decision-making process to find out the true peaks in the VI time-series curve based on a rank order mathematical morphology algorithm. The processing procedure involves five steps: (a) determination of the temporal moving window size, (b) detection of local maximum/minimum points, (c) exclusion of false maximum/minimum points, (d) determination of the threshold for the minimum growth amplitude, and (e) mapping of CI. This shape-matching method only needs two input parameters, the temporal moving window size and the threshold for the minimum growth amplitude, which can be both directly derived from the VI time-series data with some selected test pixels. Moreover, the response of the shape-matching method is relatively insensitive to the exact values of its design parameters, making it more flexible and effective in adapting to other regions. This new method is applied to map the CIs in Jiangsu Province, China, in 2010, based on the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time-series data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product. The overall CI mapping accuracy for the shape-matching method is 80 percent, which is much higher than the CI mapping accuracy of 60 percent for the second order difference algorithm. This shape-matching method can be further applied to other regions with a grid-search for its optimal parameters using some test pixels."
Mapping Fragmented Agricultural Systems in the Sudano-Sahelian Environments of Africa Using Random Forest and Ensemble Metrics of Coarse Resolution MODIS Imagery,"Vintrou, Elodie; Soumaré, Mamy; Bernard, Simon; Bégué, Agnès; Baron, Christian; Lo Seen, Danny",pp. 839-848(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000008/art00004;jsessionid=1x3rfmbgnx24e.x-ic-live-03,"We worked on the assumption that agricultural systems shaped the landscape through human cropping practices, and that the resulting landscape can be described with a set of coarse resolution satellite-derived metrics (spectral, textural, temporal, and spatial metrics). A Random Forest classification model was developed at the village scale in South Mali, based on 100 samples, with data on the main type of agricultural system in each village (three-class typology), and 30 MODIS-derived and socio-environmental metrics calculated on agricultural areas. The model was found to perform well (overall accuracy of 60 percent) and was stable. Class A (food crops) and B (intensive agriculture) displayed good producer’s accuracy (70 percent and 67 percent, respectively), while class C (mixed agriculture) was less accurate (50 percent). The most important metrics were shown to be the annual mean of NDVI, followed by the phenology transition dates and texture metrics. However, when considering each set of metrics separately, texture emerged as the most discriminating factor (with 53 percent of global accuracy). This result, i.e., that even coarse resolution imagery contains textural information that can be used for crop mapping, is new. Such maps could be used in food security systems as an indicator of system vulnerability, or as spatial inputs for crop yield models."

A hybrid model combining the SEBAL and RESET models (S-RESET) was developed to effectively estimate actual ET (water use) of the agriculture sector around the Phoenix metropolitan area. To examine how irrigated agriculture water consumption varies with climate, the S-RESET model was applied under wet and dry climatic conditions. Results show that the average ET for active agriculture is 9.3 mm/day (± 3.8mm/day) during the study period. Seasonal water use was 438 mm for 2000 (drought) and 494 mm for 2008 (wet). Based on the seasonal ET, we concluded that farmers in arid region use the same amount of water regardless of climatic conditions, implying that the agriculture sector as a whole may not be sensitive to drought as long as there is sufficient water from irrigation. This finding carries significant implications for the region’s water security."
Determining Irrigated Areas and Quantifying Blue Water Use in Europe Using Remote Sensing Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) products and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) Data,"Romaguera, Mireia; Krol, Maarten S.; Salama, Mhd.

The method compares actual ET (ETactual), or crop water use, values from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) and remote sensing based ETactual estimates obtained from Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellites. Since GLDAS simulations do not account for extra water supply due to irrigation, it is expected that they underestimate ETactualduring the cropping season in irrigated areas. However, remote sensing techniques based on the energy balance are able to observe the total ETactual. In order to isolate irrigation effects from other fluctuations that may lead to discrepancies between the different ETactualproducts, the bias between model simulations and remote sensing observations was estimated using reference targets of rainfed (non-irrigated) croplands on a daily basis in different areas across the study region (Europe). Analysis of the yearly values of ETb(irrigated area and volume obtained for croplands in Europe for 2008) showed that the method identified irrigation when yearly values were higher than 50 mm. The accuracy of the method was assessed by analyzing the spatial representativity of the calculated biases and evaluating the daily ETbvalues obtained. The irrigated areas were compared with the results provided by Siebert et al.(2007) and Thenkabail et al.(2009b), obtaining a spatial match of 47 and 72 percent, respectively, with overestimation of irrigated area on a country scale. Additional evaluation with the ETbresults of Mekonnen and Hoekstra (2011) showed 75 percent of overlap for ±50 mm range. Finally, validation with in situ data on irrigation volumes proved the cogency of our method with less than 20 percent difference between derived and measured values."

Our objectives were to assess whether cultivated area in central Iraq, as estimated using Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery, changed during and as a result of three decades of war and sanctions, and to determine which period of conflict experienced the greatest change. We created multi-temporal features of maximum normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) per pixel and used decision tree analysis to classify pixels with high maximum NDVI as cultivated. Validation with higher resolution imagery showed a 94 percent overall classification accuracy and a kappa statistic of 0.88. The results indicated that cultivated area changed little between the Iran-Iraq War (1980 to 1988) and the Gulf War (1990 to 1991), increased by 20 percent (from 1.72 to 2.04 Mha) during the period of United Nations sanctions (1990 to 2003), and dropped to below pre-sanction levels during Operation Iraqi Freedom (2003 to 2011)."

An algorithm that deals with feature extraction, keypoint matching, outlier detection, and image warping is experimented in this study. The methods currently available in the literature rely on techniques, such as the scale-invariant feature transform, between-edge cost minimization, normalized cross correlation, least-squares image matching, random sample consensus, iterated data snooping, and thin-plate splines. Their basics are highlighted and encoded into a computer program. The test images are excerpts from digital files created by the multispectral SPOT-5 and Formosat-2 sensors, side-looking ERS-2, and Envisat synthetic aperture radars, and by the panchromatic Ikonos and QuickBird sensors. Suburban areas, housing rooftops, the countryside and hilly plantations are studied. The co-registered images are displayed with block sub-images in a criss-cross pattern. Besides the imagery, the registration accuracy is expressed by the root mean square error. Toward the end, this paper also includes a few opinions on issues that are believed to hinder a correct correspondence between diverse images."
A Framework for Supervised Image Classification with Incomplete Training Samples,"Guo, Qinghua; Li, Wenkai; Liu, Desheng; Chen, Jin",pp. 595-604(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000006/art00002;jsessionid=6mv783v2g663c.x-ic-live-01,"For traditional supervised classification methods, all landcover types need to be exhaustively labeled to train the classifier. However, there are situations where the training sample classes are incomplete due to a lack of understanding of ground cover types in the image. In this study we propose a one-by-one (OBO) classification framework to address this incomplete training sample problem. The OBO approach is based on a one-class classifier (positive and unlabeled learning algorithm), and it extracts the land-cover type from the image one at a time. The performance of the proposed method was compared with a traditional supervised classifier using a high spatial resolution image. The average accuracy of the new method is 76.34 percent across different training sample sizes, whereas the accuracy of the classical approach is 66.46 percent, with an increase of 9.88 percent. The results demonstrate that the proposed new framework provides significantly higher classification accuracy than the classical approach at the 95 percent confidence level, and shows promise in dealing with the incomplete training sample problem for supervised image classification."

Timothy; White, Scott M.; Sinton, John M.",pp. 605-616(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000006/art00003;jsessionid=6mv783v2g663c.x-ic-live-01,"This paper presents a novel approach to semi-automated classification of volcanic morphology on the seafloor using high-resolution multibeam sonar bathymetry and side-scan sonar backscatter imagery. The classification methodology combines a fuzzy inference system and neural network theory in an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and is capable of rapidly classifying submarine lava morphology based on bathymetry-derived surface geometry and backscatter-derived attributes of acoustics and texture. The system has been applied to a study area on a seafloor spreading ridge, the Galápagos Spreading Center (GSC), in order to quantify the distribution and relative abundance of lava flow types, which can be used to indicate variations in eruption and emplacement dynamics. A detailed assessment shows the classification has an overall accuracy of almost 90 percent with a kappa coefficient of 0.84. The neuro-fuzzy method described here is shown to be an efficient and reliable tool for classification of submarine lava morphology."
Error Propagation in Raster Data Integration,"Christman, Zachary J.; Rogan, John",pp. 617-624(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000006/art00004;jsessionid=6mv783v2g663c.x-ic-live-01,"Integrating raster-based categorical maps from multiple sources necessitates the transformation of geometric characteristics to compare maps, as in land change analyses. By projecting maps to a new geographic reference framework and scaling pixel values to a new size, distortions of map information are introduced that can affect the proportion and arrangement of thematic classes across the landscape. Using a sample land cover dataset depicting a heterogeneous landscape, this paper examines these impacts using three common raster-based transformation methods and introduces a new vector-based method that minimizes error propagation. While relative class area was best preserved by a nearest-neighbor resampling method, distortions to the contiguity of thematic classes and the overall fragmentation of the landscape were minimized when using the vectorbased projection and resampling method. Results demonstrate that more than a third of pixel values of a categorical map may be affected by common projection and scaling methods and reinforce the need for careful attention to impacts of error propagation in categorical data transformations."
Spatial Resolution Imagery Requirements for Identifying Structure Damage in a Hurricane Disaster,"Battersby, Sarah E.; Hodgson, Michael E.; Wang, Jiayu",pp. 625-635(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000006/art00005;jsessionid=6mv783v2g663c.x-ic-live-01,"In disaster response, timely collection and exploitation of remotely sensed imagery is of increasing importance. Image exploitation approaches during the immediate (first few days) aftermath of a disaster are predominantly through visual analysis rather than automated classification methods. While the temporal needs for obtaining the imagery are fairly clear (within a one- to three-day window), there have only been educated guesses about the spatial resolution requirements necessary for the imagery for visual analysis. In this paper, we report results from an empirical study to identify the coarsest spatial resolution that is adequate for tasks required immediately following a major disaster. The study was conducted using cognitive science experimental methods and evaluated the performance of individuals with varying image interpretation skills in the task of mapping hurricane-related residential structural damage. Through this study, we found 1.5 m as a threshold for the coarsest spatial resolution imagery that can successfully be used for this task. The results of the study are discussed in terms of the likelihood of collection of this type of imagery within the temporal window required for emergency management operations."
Towards Operational Automatic Flood Detection Using EOS/MODIS Data,"Sun, Donglian; Yu, Yunyue; Zhang, Rui; Li, Sanmei; Goldberg, Mitchell D.",pp. 637-646(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000006/art00006;jsessionid=6mv783v2g663c.x-ic-live-01,"This study investigates how to derive water fraction and flood map from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) using a Regression Tree (RT) approach, which can integrate all predictors. The New Orleans, Louisiana floods in August 2005 were selected as a case study. MODIS surface reflectance with matched water fraction data were used for training. The tree-based regression models were obtained automatically through learning process. The tree structure reveals that near-infrared reflectance is more important than the difference and ratio between near-infrared and visible channels for water fraction estimate. Flood distributions were generated using the differences in water fraction values between after and before the flooding. The derived water fractions were evaluated against 30 m Thematic Mapper (TM) data from Landsat observations. Water fractions derived from the MODIS and TM data agree well (R20.94, bias 0.38 percent, and RMSE 4.35 percent). The results show that the RT approach in dynamic monitoring of floods is acceptable."

Waste tires are complex spectrally-variable targets, mixing geographically and spectrally with other land covers like water and shadow. Additionally, few training sets are available. We describe a methodology combining visual analysis and the use of a univariate decision tree to locate waste tire piles in 8,498 sq km of QuickBird imagery along the United States-Mexico border. A total of 89 sites were identified as possible waste tire disposal sites and targeted for field inspection. Excluding two sites previously known to the analyst and eleven sites that were inaccessible to the inspectors, 66 of target sites (87 percent) were correctly identified by this methodology as containing tires. Three sites were determined to be false positives (4 percent errors of commission) through ground verification, but errors of omission were not able to be determined in this study."
Urban Tree Cover Mapping with Relief-corrected Aerial Imagery and Lidar,"Lehrbass, Brad; Wang, Jinfei",pp. 473-484(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000005/art00002;jsessionid=5iqigtmftok4o.x-ic-live-01,"Urban tree canopy cover is often mapped by classifying high-resolution multispectral imagery. However, it can be difficult to differentiate low-lying vegetation from tree cover using optical data alone. Combining a lidar-derived Normalized Digital Surface Model (NDSM) improves classification accuracy, but the optical imagery is often imperfectly aligned with the NDSM. Aerial imagery is normally orthorectified using the ground elevation. However, tall objects in the orthorectified imagery still suffer from relief displacement. This can cause classification errors when lidar and the aerial imagery are combined.This study presents an approach for urban tree cover mapping composed of two parts: a method for correcting the relief displacement of trees in previously orthorectified aerial imagery, and an object-based classification method which combines relief-corrected multispectral aerial imagery with a lidar-derived NDSM. Using these methods, the tree cover was mapped for a 1,600 ha region of London, Ontario, Canada with improved positional and classification accuracy."

Simple band ratio algorithms, band tuning methods, semi-empirical algorithms, and the modified Gaussian model (MGM) parameters were used to estimate CHL and PC from multiple source spectral datasets of two eutrophic central Indiana reservoirs: Eagle Creek and Morse. The spectral datasets were collected over a three-year period (2005 to 2007) using two field-based (ASD Field-Spec; Ocean Optics USB4000) spectroradiometers Spectral parameters used in these mapping algorithms were examined for their correlation to the CHL and PC concentrations. The results demonstrate for estimating CHL, simple and modified band ratios performed well; for PC estimation, the highest performing models include the algorithms using MGM strength and band tuning methodology."
Estimating Urban Leaf Area Index (LAI) of Individual Trees with Hyperspectral Data,"Jensen, Ryan R.; Hardin, Perry J.; Hardin, Andrew J.",pp. 495-504(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000005/art00004;jsessionid=5iqigtmftok4o.x-ic-live-01,"This study estimated leaf area index (LAI) of individual urban trees as a function of spectral features derived from airborne hyperspectral data. Candidate features included spectral indexes, principal components, and calibrated reflectance values. Hyperspectral images were acquired over Provo, Utah area, and LAI of 204 deciduous trees was measured in the field. These tree canopies were identified on the images, and spectral features were extracted using both whole canopy and mean-lit spectra techniques. Multiple regression and artificial neural networks were used to model leaf area and determine which spectral features were most strongly related to it. Results established that simple hyperspectral vegetation indexes explained more variation in urban tree LAI than either principal component scores or simple band reflectance values. The neural network model trained with a subset of those indexes explained more variation in LAI (R2= 64.8 percent) than any of the multiple regression models tested."

The initialization problem has proved difficult and a variety of initialization techniques have been proposed. We present a new method that takes advantage of the scaled orthographic projection to compute direct linear solutions that approximate the image network geometry. The algorithm includes two relative orientation methods adapted from previous work, and incorporates a recently developed orthographic bundle adjustment method. Following initial network orientation, image coordinates are corrected for perspective to obtain an intermediate solution which is converted into perspective projection parameters and a final bundle adjustment is performed. The method has been tested using several image sets and has proven to be effective at various fields of view, with a variety of imaging network geometries, and with different object point geometries."

The typical photogrammetric relative precision realized was 1:175,000, corresponding to an accuracy of better than 1 mm at the jig reference points. The validation of the mirrored surface achieved a relative precision of 1:300,000. Photogrammetry was also used to characterize the dish mirror panels. The rear surface of the panels was mapped, as it made possible a denser target array and quicker image capture than if the reflective surface was used. The targets were produced with a digital projector, and the typical measurement precision attained was 1:150,000. This paper describes the equipment and techniques required to provide the required accuracy and precision for the jig and panel surfaces."

Emphasized are areas in which further development and research are desirable. A brief discussion of the concepts and implementation of the African Cultural Heritage Sites and Landscapes Project, as executed by the Zamani Research Group at the University of Cape Town, is incorporated into the paper. This database integrates spatial and non-spatial data and focuses on architectural heritage sites and cultural landscapes. The spatial data comprises of 3D laser scans, GIS’s for each site and its environment, stereo images, panoramas, ground plans, elevations and sections derived from laser scan models, contextual photography and videos as well as 3D landscape models. The database is primarily designed as a resource for research and higher education. However, the spatial data acquired for the project are presently used in a number of restoration and conservation projects. An important further objective is the creation of a permanent digital record. The project, funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, is a joint initiative of the Zamani Research Group at the University of Cape Town and JStor, New York."
Cell-based Automatic Deformation Computation by Analyzing Terrestrial Lidar Point Clouds,"Wu, Jing; Gilliéron, Pierre-Yves; Merminod, Bertrand",pp. 317-329(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000004/art00002;jsessionid=5bkm7g5nshh14.x-ic-live-02,"This paper presents a cell-based approach for computing the deformation of a monitored object by analyzing point cloud data from terrestrial lidar. This approach can automatically generate an informative deformation description (called “deformation map”) with distinctive deformation characteristics for different partial areas. The approach consists of three major computing steps: (a) “split” - the space of the monitored object is divided into 3D uniform cells, (b) “detect” - deformation parameters for each cell (called “meta-deformation”) are estimated by comparing the point clouds in the cell sampled at Epochs I and II, and (c) “merge” - the adjacent cells with similar meta-deformation are combined together in a partial area with a consistent “sub-deformation.” The main contributions of this paper are: (a) a hybrid deformation model for incremental and comprehensive deformation representation, including meta-deformation, sub-deformation and deformation map, (b) a systematic procedure of “split-detect-merge” to automatically and gradually estimate the hybrid deformation model, and (c) a complete validation with a couple of synthetic and real datasets."
Automated Extraction of Road Markings from Mobile Lidar Point Clouds,"Yang, Bisheng; Fang, Lina; Li, Qingquan; Li, Jonathan",pp. 331-338(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000004/art00003;jsessionid=5bkm7g5nshh14.x-ic-live-02,"Among implicit information of laser points, the strength of reflection of laser points is closely related to the property of road materials which helps detecting road markings. This paper presents a novel approach to automatically extracting road markings from mobile lidar point clouds. An interpolation method is first used to generate a georeferenced feature image of the point cloud, which helps to isolate the points of road surfaces. Then, an algorithm is used to separate these points within a range according to their strength of reflection. The separated points are further segmented to remove non-road points based on height threshold. Finally, the outlines of road markings are extracted from the segmented points using the semantic knowledge of road markings. The results demonstrated that our method was very promising for automatic extraction of road markings from lidar point clouds collected by a land-based mobile lidar system, an Optech Lynx Mobile Mapper."

The mathematical model for both the measurements of the HDL-64E S2 scanner and their georeferencing by a GNSS/INS system is presented and discussed. A planar feature based least squares adjustment approach is utilized in order to derive an optimal solution for the laser’s internal calibration parameters and boresight offsets. The results of the adjustment on an actual kinematic dataset along with a detailed examination of the adjustment residuals are given. An approximately 30 percent improvement in the 3D planar misclosure residual RMSE was achieved by the proposed calibration, as compared to an estimation of the laser boresight parameters only. Results also suggest that there may still be some un-modeled distortions in the range measurements from the scanner. However, despite this, the overall precision of the adjusted laser scanner data appears to make it a viable choice for high accuracy mobile scanning applications."

The rate of woody plant encroachment is increasing rapidly on rangelands of the southwestern US. However, woody plants, such as mesquite, are a possible source of bioenergy feedstock found on semi-arid lands. This study developed algorithms for determining woody plant biomass on rangelands at plot-level with a terrestrial lidar system. Two processing methods were investigated for analyzing the lidar point cloud data, namely: (a) percentile height statistics, and (b) a height bin approach. Regression models were developed for variables obtained through each processing technique and were able to explain 81 percent and 77 percent of the variance associated with the aboveground biomass using two processing methods, respectively. The results of this study revealed that terrestrial lidar can be used to accurately and efficiently estimate the aboveground biomass of woody plants in a semi-arid environment at plot level."
Terrestrial Laser Scanning for Delineating In-stream Boulders and Quantifying Habitat Complexity Measures,"Resop, Jonathan P.; Kozarek, Jessica L.; Hession, W.

Habitat complexity measures are often made using visual approximations or total station (TS) surveying that can be subjective and have limited spatial resolution. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) can measure topography at a high resolution and accuracy. Two methods, TS surveying and TLS, were compared for measuring complex topography in a boulder-dominated 100 m forested reach of the Staunton River in Shenandoah National Park, Virginia. The mean absolute difference between the two datasets was 0.11 m with 82.3 percent of the TS data within ±0.1 m of TLS. The TLS dataset was processed to remove vegetation and create a 2 cm digital elevation model (DEM). An algorithm was developed for delineating rocks within the stream channel from the DEM. A common ecological metric based on the structural complexity of the stream, percent in-stream rock cover, was calculated from the TLS dataset, and the results were compared to estimates from traditional methods. This application illustrates the potential of TLS to quantify habitat complexity measures in an automated, unbiased manner."

Aiming at reducing the technical bottlenecks of management and visualization of very large point cloud data sets, this paper proposes a new spatial organization method called 3DOR-Tree, which integrates Octree and 3D R-Tree data structures. This method utilizes Octree’s rapid convergence to generate R-Tree leaf nodes, which are inserted directly into the R-Tree, thus avoiding time-consuming point-by-point insertion operations. Furthermore, this paper extends the R-Tree structure to support LOD (level of detail) models. Based on the extended structure, a practical data management method is presented. Finally, an adaptive control method for LODS of point clouds is illustrated. Typical experimental results show that our method possesses quasi-real-time index construction speed, a good storage utilization rate, and efficient visualization performance."

Therefore, we propose a method to retrieve the spatial tree structure from 3D point clouds captured by a terrestrial laser scanner. The procedure addresses dense and noisy data sets of separate trees. Our method involves a variation of the Circular Hough Transform to determine trunk positions and a sequence of operations in voxel space. The core of the approach is the depth-first search algorithm, known from graph theory, to actually recover the tree as a graph. Furthermore, we compare results obtained from the tree graph to reference measurements of forest inventory parameters. The computation time of our method for topology representation is low and the method provides a reasonably accurate approximation of the 3D tree structure."
Automatic Registration of High-Resolution Images Using Local Properties of Features,"Han, You Kyung; Byun, Young Gi; Choi, Jae Wan; Han, Dong Yeob; Kim, Yong II",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000003/art00001;jsessionid=2erbek4tr5fde.x-ic-live-02,"We propose an automatic image-to-image registration of high-resolution satellite images using local properties and geometric locations of control points to improve the registration accuracy. First, coefficients of global affine transformation between images are extracted using a scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT)-based method, and features of the sensed image are transformed to the reference coordinate system using these coefficients. Then, a spatial distance and orientation difference between features of the reference and sensed images are additionally used to extract a large number of evenly distributed control points. The specified spatial distance is calculated between features of the sensed image that have been transformed to the reference coordinates and features of the reference image. Finally, the spatial distance integrated with Euclidean distances of invariant vectors is employed for local matching. The average orientation differences between control points of the two images are used for outlier elimination. A mapping function model consisting of an affine transformation and piecewise linear functions is applied to the control points for automatic registration of high-resolution images. The proposed method can extract a larger number of spatially well-distributed control points than SIFT-based methods. The registration accuracy for all sites calculated from manually selected checkpoints has acceptable geometric accuracy at the pixel level."

Forest replacing disturbances were first identified using a vegetation index (VI) threshold, then classified using descriptors of the disturbance/recovery trajectory: disturbance minimum, recovery slope, and recovery maximum. Three VIs (normalized difference vegetation index or NDVI; the tasseled cap greenness/brightness ratio, TC G/B; and the inverse of Landsat band 3, B3I) were used to analyze multitemporal trajectories generated using both pixels and objects. Classification accuracies using objects were better than those obtained using pixels for all VIs. The highest object-based classification accuracy was achieved using TC G/B (89 percent), followed by NDVI (88 percent) and B3I (80 percent). The diagnostic parameters in mined-land trajectories were found to be distinctly different from other landscape disturbances, leading to a satisfactory classification based on disturbance/recovery trajectories."

Conjugate points in the stereo images were measured using two methods: (a) using an automated centroid detection method, and (b) a manual measurement method to replicate real field conditions. The first experiment demonstrated that a relative error of less than 1 percent could be achieved. The second experiment showed that remounting the two cameras on the stereo bar contributed significantly to measurement error. Nevertheless, the error associated with remounting the cameras compares with that associated with the uncertainties of manually selecting conjugate points. Thus, it is demonstrated that dismounting the stereo system for practical reasons while at sea does not compromise the accuracy."

Planimetric Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE2D) close to 0.7 pixels, both for PAN and MS images, were attained using the third order 3D rational functions with the vendor’s rational polynomial coefficients data afterwards being refined by a zero order polynomial adjustment (RPC0). Furthermore, the RPC0 sensor model proved to be significantly independent regarding the number and distribution of the GCPs. The RPC0 model yielded RMSE2Dclose to 0.46 m and 1.56 m for the PAN and MS orthorectified images, respectively, using a very accurate lidar-derived digital elevation model."

Previous approaches to riparian boundary delineation utilized fixed width buffers, but using a fixed width riparian buffer only takes the watercourse into consideration; it does not consider the surrounding landscape. By hydrologically defining a riparian ecotone to occur at the 50-year flood height and incorporating digital elevation data, the spatial modeling capabilities of ArcMap®GIS are utilized to map riparian zones accurately. This approach better characterizes the watercourse and its associated floodplain. Riparian zones delineated using 10 versus 30 meter DEMs and stream course information from the National Hydrography Dataset differ significantly. Within our study areas, 30 meter DEMs are not adequate to map elevation changes for accurate riparian area delineation. The result is a robust GIS based model in an ArcMap®Toolbox format to delineate a variable-width riparian boundary."

The TC, PCA, and NDVI images were used alone and in combination with original bands for classification. Results using PC1–3, Bands 1 through 5, Bands 1 through 4, and 7 combinations were better than others, but the Bands 1 through 4 combination performed best across all dates. The highest accuracy was obtained with a mid summer (January) image (96.5 percent, Kappa 0.96) and the lowest with an early spring (September) image (86.7 percent, Kappa 0.84). The superiority of mid-summer images in generating highly accurate land-cover classifications was demonstrated by analysis of additional images under varying rainfall conditions in different years."
An Empirical Model-based Method for Signal Restoration of SWIR in ASD Field Spectroradiometry,"Lin, Chinsu; Tsogt, Khongor; Chang, Chein-I",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000002/art00001;jsessionid=5kqt0todhi6qi.x-ic-live-02,"ASD spectroradiometer field measurements in the SWIR water absorption region are sometimes problematic due to atmospheric effects such as moisture in the air. The reduced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in these wavebands makes it difficult to diagnose water stress in tree foliage using spectroscopy. This paper investigates the SNR issue in the 1,350 to 1,410nm waveband using laboratory-based experiments and practical field measurements of mountainous tree foliage spectra. With laboratory spectra data, three empirical signal models along with a Gaussian bias model were tested and validated using noisy field spectra data. Results demonstrate that a combination of either a logistic or sigmoid signal model coupled with a Gaussian bias (residual) model (LOGGM and SIGGM complex signal models) can effectively describe reflectance behaviors in the spectral region of 1,350 to 1,410 nm of red cypress (Chaemacyparis formosensis) foliage and further show that our proposed approach is promising in restoration of field spectra measurements."
Incorporating the Downscaled Landsat TM Thermal Band in Land-cover Classification using Random Forest,"Rodríguez-Galiano, V.F.; Ghimire, B.; Pardo-Igúzquiza, E.; Chica-Olmo, M.; Congalton, R.G.",pp. 129-137(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000002/art00002;jsessionid=5kqt0todhi6qi.x-ic-live-02,"Thermal information is a key parameter in numerous remote sensing applications and environmental studies. The aim of this study was to assess the improvement that incorporating the TIR band of the Landsat-5 TM sensor has in the classification of a large heterogeneous landscape located in the south of Spain. To incorporate the thermal data into the classification process, the TIR band (with spatial resolution of 120 m) was downscaled by means of a geostatistical method (Downscaling Cokriging) to achieve a spatial resolution of 30 meters. Then, the thermal information was evaluated for contribution to overall and per-class map accuracy using Random Forest classification. The addition of the TIR band to single-season and multi-seasonal Random Forest models leads to an increase in the overall accuracy of 10 percent and 5 percent, and to an increase in the kappa index of 10 percent and 5 percent, respectively. The increase in per-class kappa for the thermal, single-season, Random Forest model ranged from −3 percent to 47 percent and 0 percent to 12 percent for the thermal, multi-seasonal model."

This paper presents an integrated GNSS (IGNSS) QOS prediction methodology that can provide navigation applications with quality of GNSS positions on prospective roads in a selected route ahead of time. As a part of the methodology, this paper discusses the technique for simulating signal paths using lidar data and signal propagation models for predicting levels of satellite visibility, positional availability, and positional accuracy. Experiments were conducted, and the predicted results by IGNSS QOS were evaluated against reference data (GPS coordinates) at various environment settings. Evaluation results indicated that IGNSS QOS can predict positioning quality with reasonably a high level of confidence in open sky locations and with some uncertainties in obstructed locations."

The 12 monthly LST images for the year 2008 are transformed using principal components analysis, and then elevation, latitude, and longitude predict, through a multiple linear regression model, the first two principal components (PC-1, PC-2) that accounts for the 95.2 percent of the variance. The PC-1, PC-2 predicted images accounts for the 81.3 percent of the variance. If dimension reduction (omit PC-1 and PC-2) is applied, then 14.2 percent of variance that is explained by the PC-1 and PC-2 residuals images and it is independent from elevation, latitude, and longitude, will be subtracted. Selective variance reduction reconstructs the imagery from the two residual images as well as PC-3 to PC-12 images. The reconstructed imagery presents the magnitude the standardized LST value per pixel deviates from the elevation, latitude, and longitude predicted."
Integrating Remote Sensing and Wavelet Analysis for Studying Fine-scaled Vegetation Spatial Variation among Three Different Ecosystems,"He, Yuhong; Khan, Anum; Mui, Amy",pp. 161-168(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000002/art00005;jsessionid=5kqt0todhi6qi.x-ic-live-02,"This study investigated the optimum pixel size for detecting vegetation spatial patterns in a complex environment where three different ecosystems (grassland, shrubland, and forest) are present. Wavelet analysis indicated that ground Leaf Area Index (LAI) along the study transect is significant at a scale of 8 m. Following the sampling theorem, 2 m would be an optimum pixel size to detect potentially important vegetation patterns (possible sensors include QuickBird 2.4 m and Ikonos 3.2 m). A QuickBird image was then acquired to evaluate its suitability to identify vegetation patterns for the study area. The LAI map derived from QuickBird WDRVI (Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index) showed distinct vegetation patterns among three ecosystems. These results confirmed that the dominant spatial scale of ground vegetation biophysical properties (e.g., LAI) can aid in the selection of appropriate image resolution for monitoring multiple ecosystems."
"Integration of Polarimetric Decomposition, Object-Oriented Image Analysis, and Decision Tree Algorithms for Land-Use and Land-Cover Classification using RADARSAT-2 Polarimetric SAR Data","Qi, Zhixin; Yeh, Anthony G.O.; Li, Xia; Lin, Zheng",pp. 169-181(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000002/art00006;jsessionid=5kqt0todhi6qi.x-ic-live-02,"A novel method which integrates polarimetric decomposition, object-oriented image analysis, and decision tree algorithms is presented for land-use and land-cover (LULC) classification using RADARSAT-2 polarimetric SAR (POLSAR) data. Polarimetric decomposition which is aimed at extracting polarimetric parameters related to the physical scattering mechanisms of the observed objects can be used to support the classification of POLSAR data. The main purposes of object-oriented image analysis are delineating image objects as well as extracting various textural and spatial features from image objects to improve classification accuracy. A decision tree algorithm provides an efficient way to select features and implement classification. Compared with the Wishart supervised classification which is based on the coherency matrix, the proposed method can significantly improve the overall accuracy and kappa value of LULC classification by 17.45 percent and 0.24, respectively. Further investigation was carried out on the contribution of polarimetric decomposition, object-oriented image analysis, and decision tree algorithms to the improvement achieved by the proposed method. The investigation shows that all these three methods contribute to the improvement achieved by the proposed method."
A Comparison of Multispectral ASTER and Hyperspectral AVIRIS Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis for Sagebrush and Herbaceous Cover in Yellowstone,"Fairweather, Stacey; Potter, Christopher; Crabtree, Robert; Li, Shuang",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000001/art00001;jsessionid=74bgo0kja4b7a.x-ic-live-01,"Remote sensing techniques can provide information on habitat quality, biodiversity, and cover change at the regional scales of sagebrush-steppe dominated systems and with the repeatability necessary for resource management. In this paper, we present the results of multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis applied to Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) imagery, comparing affects of seasonality and spectral resolution on the discrimination of soil, grass/forb, and sagebrush abundance in Yellowstone National Park. Our results showed that AVIRIS, despite late season phenology, correlated well with herbaceous and sagebrush cover field measurements (R2= 0.77 and 0.75, respectively), utilizing high spectral resolution to separate soils from vegetation. However, ASTER-derived values during peak green correlated best with field measurements (0.75 and 0.78). These results demonstrated an effective method to monitor semi-arid regions with readily available imagery and highlight applications for future hyperspectral satellite missions."
Detect Residential Buildings from Lidar and Aerial Photographs through Object-Oriented Land-Use Classification,"Meng, Xuelian; Currit, Nate; Wang, Le; Yang, Xiaojun",pp. 35-44(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000001/art00002;jsessionid=74bgo0kja4b7a.x-ic-live-01,"Relating less directly to the physical reflectance from remote sensors, land-use analysis is comparably more challenging than land-cover studies, especially for residential land-uses. This research presents an object-oriented approach to detect residential land use of buildings directly from lidar data, aerial photography, and road maps to enhance urban land-use analysis. Specifically, the proposed methodology applies a multi-directional ground filter to generate a bare ground surface from lidar data, then uses a morphology-based building detection algorithm to identify buildings from lidar and aerial photographs, and finally separates residential buildings using a supervised C4.5 decision tree analysis based on seven land-use characteristics of buildings. Experiments based on the 8.25 km2study site located in Austin, Texas proved the possibility and efficiency of directly detecting and identifying residential buildings from remote sensing images with 81.1 percent of residential buildings correctly classified."
Improving Forest Growth Estimates Using a Bayesian Network Approach,"Mustafa, Yaseen T.; Stein, Alfred; Tolpekin, Valentyn A.; Van Laake, Patrick E.",pp. 45-51(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2012/00000078/00000001/art00003;jsessionid=74bgo0kja4b7a.x-ic-live-01,"Estimating the contribution of forests to carbon sequestration is commonly done by applying forest growth models. Such models inherently use field observations, such as leaf area index (LAI), whereas relevant information is also available from remotely sensed images. The purpose of this study is to improve the LAI estimated from the Physiological Principles Predicting Growth (3-PG) model by combining its output with LAI derived from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) satellite imagery. A Bayesian network (BN) approach is proposed to take care of the different structure of the inaccuracies in the two data sources. It addresses the bias in the 3-PG model and the noise of the ASTER images. Moreover, the EM algorithm is introduced into BN to estimate missing the LAI ASTER data, since they are not available for long time series due to the atmospheric conditions. This paper shows that the outputs obtained with the BN were more accurate than the 3-PG estimate, as the root mean square error reduces to 0.46, and the relative error to 5.86 percent. We conclude that the EM-algorithm within a BN can adequately handle missing LAI ASTER values, and BNs can improve the estimation of LAI values. Ultimately, this method may be used as a predicting model of LAI values, and handling the missing data of ASTER images time series."

This paper provides validation results for three burned area products with different pixel sizes: MCD45 (500 m), GlobCarbon (1 km), and L3JRC (1 km) for the Orinoco River basin, which is widely affected by fires, many of them oriented towards the conversion of Amazonian forest to cattle pasture. Accuracy measurements were based on commission and omission errors computed from 15 confusion matrices, as well as in the Pareto Boundary concept, which evaluates the impact of different pixel sizes in omission and commission errors. An edge metric was used to analyze the impact of shapes of burned patches on global accuracy. It was shown that all products underestimate burned-area and that an increase in pixel size or burned patch elongation, results in larger estimation errors."

Although optical satellite data can be orthorectified without the use of Ground Control Points (GCP) to absolute geometric accuracies of some meters up to several hundred meters depending on the satellite mission, there is still a need to improve the geometric accuracy by using GCP. The manual measurement of GCP is time consuming work, and leads, especially for larger data sets with hundreds of satellite images, to a cost and time ineffective workload. To overcome these shortcomings, an autonomous processing chain to georeference and orthorectify optical satellite data is proposed which uses reference data and digital elevation models to generate GCP and to improve sensor model parameters (namely for rigorous and universal sensor models) for a series of optical Earth observation satellite systems. Using a restrictive blunder removal strategy, the proposed procedure leads to high quality orthorectified products or at least to a geometrically consistent data set in terms of relative accuracy. The geometric processing chain is validated using SPOT-4 HRVIR, SPOT-5 HRG, IRS-P6 LISS III, and ALOS AVNIR-2 optical sensor data, for which a huge amount of satellite data (~3,200 scenes) has been processed. Relative and absolute geometric accuracies of approximately half the pixel size (linear Root Mean Square Error) are achieved."

Individual tree segmentations, usually derived from the canopy height model, are used to derive individual tree structural attributes such as tree height, crown diameter, canopy-based height, and others. In this study, we develop a new algorithm to segment individual trees from the small footprint discrete return airborne lidar point cloud. We experimentally applied the new algorithm to segment trees in a mixed conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California. The results were evaluated in terms of recall, precision, and F-score, and show that the algorithm detected 86 percent of the trees (“recall”), 94 percent of the segmented trees were correct (“precision”), and the overall F-score is 0.9. Our results indicate that the proposed algorithm has good potential in segmenting individual trees in mixed conifer stands of similar structure using small footprint, discrete return lidar data."
Bias Compensation in a Rigorous Sensor Model and Rational Function Model for High-Resolution Satellite Images,"Teo, Tee-Ann",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000012/art00001;jsessionid=qb9k8dlf4gpl.x-ic-live-01,"This paper presents three bias-compensated models for the geometric correction of high-resolution satellite images. The proposed models include the bias-compensated rigorous sensor model (RSM) in the orbital space, the bias-compensated RSM in the image space, and the bias-compensated rational function model (RFM) in the image space. The RSM and RFM use the on-board data and sensor-oriented rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs) provided in imagery metadata, respectively. Test images include QuickBird, WorldView-1, and WorldView-2 Basic images. Experimental results indicate that the bias-compensated RSM using the zero order polynomials function in the orbital space provides higher accuracy. A comparison of the bias-compensated RSM and RFM in the image space shows that these models behave similarly, and the maximum difference in root-mean-square error is less than 0.1 m. These results show that all the proposed methods obtain accuracy of better than 1 pixel, except for the translation in the image space."

Geometric features of lidar points are represented by a tensor field in this paper. For the extraction of roof patches, a region-growing method with principal features is developed from the properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the tensor field. Additionally, three new indicators for the strength of features are presented to reduce the effect of the number of points on feature identification, and a supervised method is proposed to determine the threshold of planar feature strength for the region-growing. The extraction of ridge and edge lines from the segmented roof patches is also discussed. Experiments based on airborne lidar data are described to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, with those the results compared with the PCA method."
An Assessment of Internal Neural Network Parameters Affecting Image Classification Accuracy,"Zhou, Libin; Yang, Xiaojun",pp. 1233-1240(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000012/art00003;jsessionid=qb9k8dlf4gpl.x-ic-live-01,"Neural networks are attractive intelligence techniques increasingly being used to classify remote sensor imagery. However, their performance is contingent upon a wide range of algorithm and non-algorithm factors. Despite significant progresses being made over the past two decades, there is no consistent guidance that has been established to automate the use of neural networks in remote sensing. The purpose of this study was to assess several internal parameters affecting image classification accuracy by multi-layer-perceptron (MLP) neural networks. The MLP networks have been considered as the most popular neural network architecture. We carefully configured and trained a set of neural network models with different internal parameter settings. Then, we used these models to classify an Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image into several major land cover categories, and the accuracy of each classified map was assessed. The results reveal that number of hidden layers, activation function, and training rate can substantially affect the classification accuracy and that a neural network with appropriate internal parameters can lead to a significant classification accuracy improvement for urban land covers when comparing to the outcome by the Gaussian Maximum Likelihood (GML) classifier. These findings can help design efficient neural network models for improved performance."

We explored Landsat-5 TM and Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) data, individually and fused together, for estimating sub-pixel juniper cover. Linear spectral unmixing (LSU), Constrained Energy Minimization (CEM), and Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering (MTMF) techniques were compared along with spectral-lidar fusion approaches. None of the Landsat-5 TM-derived estimates were significantly correlated with field-measured juniper cover (n = 100), while lidar-derived estimates were strongly correlated (R2= 0.74, p-value<0.001). Fusion of these estimates produced superior results to both classifications individually (R2= 0.80, p-value<0.001). The MTMF technique performed best, while a multiple regression-based fusion was the best approach to combining the two data sources. Future studies can use the best sub-pixel classification and fusion approach to quantify changes in associated ecosystem properties such as carbon."

The use of the Terrain Data Set structure allowed for embedding large data sets (such as lidar points) and archiving them after DTM creation while maintaining topographic analysis capabilities. The bathy-metric data, natively referenced to Mean Sea Level (MSL), were converted to North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88) using an inverse distance weighted average offset from the three nearest NOAA tidal benchmark stations; results of this conversion were within 6.1 centimeters of those produced by NOAA VDatum software in a quality control test area. This methodology can therefore be used in coastal regions of other countries."

Additional analyses were conducted to compare classified aerial images to ground-measured landscaped areas, landscaped areas to total parcel size, water use on residential and commercial properties, and turf areas under trees when they were leafed out and bare. Results verified the accuracy and value of this approach for municipal water management, showed more commercial properties applied water in excess of estimated needs compared to residential ones, and that small percentages of users accounted for most of the excess irrigation."

A new distance metric named Slope, Intercept, and Correlation Distance (SICD) is introduced and compared with Euclidean Distance (ED) and Mahalanobis Distance (MD). Using leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation, the estimation performance of KNN technique is then compared with a linear regression model. The research indicates that the SICD is slightly better than ED and MD but no significant differences were found between them in estimating AGC. For extreme AGC conditions, the KNN technique has a greater estimation performance than that of the linear regression model, and is a convenient and effective method for estimating AGC of Moso bamboo forests in a large area."

Processed MODIS daily vegetation index (VI) trends were consistent with previously determined impact and recovery patterns provided by the “snapshot” 25 m Landsat Thematic Mapper optical and RADARSAT-1 synthetic aperture radar satellite data. Phenological trends showed high 2004 and 2005 pre-hurricane temporal correspondence within bottomland hardwood forest communities, except during spring green-up, and temporal dissimilarity between these hardwoods and nearby cypress-tupelo swamp forests (Taxodium distichum [baldcypress] and Nyssa aquatica [water tupelo]). MODIS VI trend analyses established that one year after impact, cypress-tupelo and lightly impacted hardwood forests had recovered to near pre-hurricane conditions. In contrast, canopy recovery lagged in the moderately and severely damaged hardwood forests, possibly reflecting regeneration of pre-hurricane species and stand-level replacement by invasive trees."
A Volumetric Approach to Population Estimation Using Lidar Remote Sensing,"Lu, Zhenyu; Im, Jungho; Quackenbush, Lindi",pp. 1145-1156(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000011/art00004;jsessionid=49afse5vmj6ul.x-ic-live-01,"This research investigated the applicability of lidar data for estimating population at the census block level using a volumetric approach. The study area, near the urban downtown area of Denver, Colorado, was selected since it includes dense distribution of different types of residential buildings. A modified morphological building detection algorithm was proposed to extract buildings from the lidar-derived surfaces. The extraction results showed that the modified morphological building detection algorithm can effectively recover building pixels occluded by nearby trees. The extracted buildings were further refined to residential buildings using parcel data. Two approaches (i.e., area- and volume-based) to population estimation were investigated at the census block level. Four regression models (i.e., simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, regression tree using one variable, and regression tree using multiple variables) were used to identify the relationship between census population and the area or volume information of the residential buildings. The volume-based models overwhelmingly outperformed the area-based models in the study area, and the models using multiple variables yielded more accurate estimation than the single variable models. The volume-based regression tree model using multiple variables yielded the most accurate estimations: R2=0.89, RMSE=21 people, and RRMSE=26.8 percent in the calibration site; and R2=0.80, RMSE=27 people, and RRMSE=30.1 percent in the validation site. As the results show, the volumetric approach using lidar remote sensing is effective for population estimation in regions with heterogeneous housing characteristics."
Automatic Georeferencing of Aerial Images Using Stereo High-Resolution Satellite Images,"Oh, Jaehong; Toth, Charles K.; Grejner-Brzezinska, Dorota A.",pp. 1157-1168(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000011/art00005;jsessionid=49afse5vmj6ul.x-ic-live-01,"For airborne surveys, the GPS/INS system has become the primary source for aerial image georeferencing. However, alternative automated georeferencing is required to serve as a backup for georeferencing when GPS/INS-based georeferencing is not feasible. High-resolution satellite images (HRSI) have been globally available with better spatial resolution and increasing positional accuracy. Therefore, HRSI has high potential as a ground control source for aerial image georeferencing which usually requires accurate 3D ground control points. Unfortunately, single imagery, which is often used as a reference, contains relief displacement due to objects on the ground introducing positional errors, unless it is not true ortho-rectified which is costly and time consuming. Therefore, in this study, a stereo HRSI-based automated georeferencing approach is proposed. The use of stereo images can avoid the impact of relief displacement and requires no external height information. The proposed method is based on a multi-scale image matching approach utilizing a combination of SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) and RANSAC (RANdom SAmple Consensus). In the georeferencing step, the bundle adjustment with outlier removal of Baarda’s data snooping was utilized. Experimental results for a strip of aerial images with stereo Ikonos images showed its potential as a backup system for automated georeferencing."
Detection of Swimming Pools by Geographic Object-based Image Analysis to Support West Nile Virus Control Efforts,"Kim, Minho; Holt, James B.; Eisen, Rebecca J.; Padgett, Kerry; Reisen, William K.; Croft, Janet B.",pp. 1169-1179(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000011/art00006;jsessionid=49afse5vmj6ul.x-ic-live-01,"The recent economic crisis in United States has led to an increase in home foreclosures and subsequent abandonments. A by-product of this trend has been an associated rise in the number of neglected swimming pools, which provide new habitats for the larval stages of the Culex mosquito vectors of West Nile Virus (WNV) in urban and suburban environments. WNV has been major concern related to neglected swimming pools in California. Our research focused on using very high spatial resolution (VHR) satellite imagery and processing techniques, including image pansharpening, normalized difference water index, and geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA), to develop a geographic information system (GIS) database of swimming pool locations. This research demonstrated that GEOBIA with VHR imagery could produce a GIS database of swimming pools with the high accuracy of 94 percent. The analytic approach of this research is expected to economically facilitate the location of swimming pools for ground inspection and mosquito control."
A Comprehensive Analysis of Building Damage in the 12 January 2010 Mw7 Haiti Earthquake Using High-Resolution Satelliteand Aerial Imagery,"Corbane, Christina; Saito, Keiko; Dell’Oro, Luca; Bjorgo, Einar; Gill, Stuart P.D.; Emmanuel Piard, Boby; Huyck, Charles K.; Kemper, Thomas; Lemoine, Guido; Spence, Robin J.S.; Shankar, Ravi; Senegas, Olivier; Ghesquiere, Francis; Lallemant, David; Evans, Galen B.; Gartley, Ross A.; Toro, Joaquin; Ghosh, Shubharoop; Svekla, Walter D.; Adams, Beverley J.; Eguchi, Ronald T.",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000010/art00001;jsessionid=878tbh0k0qs02.x-ic-live-02,"The paper provides an account of how three key relief organizations worked together after the devastating Haiti earthquake to produce the first damage assessment based mainly on the use of remotely-sensed imagery. This assessment was jointly conducted by the World Bank (WB), the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) Operational Satellite Applications Programme (UNOSAT), and the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC). This paper discusses the data sources used for the assessment, the methodologies employed to evaluate building damage, and a set of independent studies to validate the final damage results. Finally, a vision of the role of remote sensing technologies in future disasters is presented that serves as a road map for methodological improvements."
Building Extraction and Rubble Mapping for City Port-au-Prince Post-2010 Earthquake with GeoEye-1 Imagery and Lidar Data,"Ural, Serkan; Hussain, Ejaz; Kim, KyoHyouk; Fu, Chiung-Shiuan; Shan, Jie",pp. 1011-1023(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000010/art00002;jsessionid=878tbh0k0qs02.x-ic-live-02,"This paper uses GeoEye-1 imagery and airborne lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) data to map buildings and their rubble in Port-au-Prince caused by the Haiti earthquake on 12 January 2010. This is achieved by performing an object-based one-class-at-a-time land cover classification of the image and lidar data using spectral, textural and height information. Classification accuracy is about 87 percent overall, and approximately 80 percent for buildings and rubble. Comparison of manually-selected 200 actual damaged buildings within an area of two sq. km in the city center shows an accuracy of over 90 percent for building and rubble mapping. 3D building models for approximately 55,000 buildings covering an area of 30 sq. km over Port-au-Prince were generated. It is found that most of the damage is to the concrete and masonry structures in the well planned areas of the city and very little damage to the shelters and the temporary type houses with metal sheet roofs. The study demonstrates that fusing optical imagery and lidar data can effectively map the nature, severity, extent and damage patterns caused by earthquakes in densely populated urban areas like Port-au-Prince."
Damage Assessment of 2010 Haiti Earthquake with Post-Earthquake Satellite Image by Support Vector Selection and Adaptation,"Taskin Kaya, Gülsen; Musaoglu, Nebiye; Ersoy, Okan K.",pp. 1025-1035(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000010/art00003;jsessionid=878tbh0k0qs02.x-ic-live-02,"Remote sensing technology is a powerful tool to extract regions damaged after an earthquake. There are two methodological approaches in detection of earthquake damage: mono-temporal and multi-temporal. Especially for providing effective emergency management, the mono-temporal approach is generally preferred in extraction of earthquake damage as it does not depend on availability of pre-earthquake imagery. For this purpose, a novel method called support vector selection and adaptation (SVSA) has been introduced to detect the damaged regions from a post-earthquake image. In this study, the SVSA method was applied to the region where the Haiti Presidential Palace and Cathedral is located, and the damaged regions were identified. The performance of the SVSA method in identification of the damaged regions was evaluated by comparing the thematic maps obtained by classifying pre- and post-earthquake images. Additionally, the damage patterns for the city of Port-au-Prince were estimated by the SVSA."

Earth Observation (EO)-based damage assessment was among the tools used to coordinate relief efforts; most of the published maps, however, are still based on weather-dependent optical data and visual interpretation. Only recently, methods based on radar data began to emerge, although not yet consolidated. In this paper we elaborate on a method for damage assessment on urban areas set up on the occasion of the 2008 Sichuan event and refined on the 2009 L’Aquila earthquake; direct investigation of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, providing an even larger statistical base thanks to the extent of the Port-au-Prince urban area, allowed pinpointing some characteristic behaviors potentially useful to improve damage assessment results. In particular, we note how results changed thanks to a more reliable and accurate revision of reference data and outline a possible starting point for correction of damage over/underestimation. Quantitative results are provided."
Change Detection Applying Landscape Metrics on High Remote Sensing Images,"Malinverni, Eva Savina",pp. 1045-1056(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000010/art00005;jsessionid=878tbh0k0qs02.x-ic-live-02,"The Haiti earthquake produced a big effort in the remote sensing data collection. Many international surveying organizations were involved to collect, process, and use the spatial information to rescue the population. Here, a change detection methodology based on landscape metrics, derived by the landscape ecology and implemented in FRAGSTAST software is presented. Some of these metrics were applied to Pre-event and Post-event classified images (QuickBird and Ikonos). The attention was focused on ten test areas, characterized by different spatial patterns and urban structures. The land-cover classification (Urban and Other) was provided by an unsupervised K-Means algorithm in ILWIS open source software. The final results and their temporal comparison have allowed localization of the earthquake damages and the occurred changes, and also analyzing the fragmentation of the urban morphology. The GIS management of the information has improved the thematic map production, with useful results very for damage assessment."
A Novel Method for Urban Road Damage Detection Using Very High Resolution Satellite Imagery and Road Map,"Li, Peijun; Xu, Haiqing; Song, Benqin",pp. 1057-1066(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000010/art00006;jsessionid=878tbh0k0qs02.x-ic-live-02,"In this paper, a novel method for detecting earthquake damage to urban road networks using very high resolution (VHR) satellite images is proposed. The study focuses on road blockage caused by rubble from collapsed buildings. The road regions were first extracted from a pre-event road map. The damage to the road network was then detected from the post-event VHR image of the road regions using object-based classification, where both spectral and texture information was used. The damage to adjacent buildings was also extracted and used to refine the initial result of the road damage detection. The proposed method was evaluated using bitemporal VHR images and the road map of Port au Prince, Haiti, which was heavily hit by an earthquake in January 2010. The experimental results showed that the proposed method outperformed the direct use of various data combinations in road damage detection and achieved the best performance, with an overall accuracy (OA) of 81.50 percent and a Kappa coefficient of 61.23 percent. In particular, when the refinement step with building damage information in the area adjacent to the road was applied, the OA and Kappa were significantly improved."

Traditional methods have limitations: ground-based mapping is slow and largely limited to façade information, and image-based mapping is typically restricted to vertical (roof) views. Here, we assess the value of photogrammetrically processed airborne oblique, multi-perspective Pictometry data, in a two-step approach: (a) supervised classification into façades, intact roofs, destroyed roofs and vegetation using 22 image-derived features, and (b) combining the classification results from different viewing directions into a per-building damage score adapted from the European Macroseismic Scale (EMS 98) for damage classification (no-moderate damage, heavy damage, destruction). Overall classification accuracies for the four classes and for the building damage of 70 percent and 63 percent, respectively, were achieved. Image stereo overlap helped classify façades, but problems with the relatively vague EMS damage class definitions were encountered, and subjectivity in training data generation affected overall classification by up to 10 percent."

Communication was rapidly established between the widely distributed response teams and data providers to define imaging requirements and sensor tasking opportunities. Data acquired from a variety of sources were received and archived by the USGS, and these products were subsequently distributed using the Hazards Data Distribution System (HDDS) and other mechanisms. Within six weeks after the earthquake, over 600,000 files representing 54 terabytes of data were provided to the response community. The USGS directly supported a wide variety of groups in their use of these data to characterize post-earthquake conditions and to make comparisons with pre-event imagery. The rapid and continuing response achieved was enabled by existing imaging and ground systems, and skilled personnel adept in all aspects of satellite data acquisition, processing, distribution and analysis. The information derived from image interpretation assisted senior planners and on-site teams to direct assistance where it was most needed."
Seismic-zonation of Port-au-Prince Using Pixel- and Object-based Imaging Analysis Methods on ASTER GDEM,"Yong, Alan; Hough, Susan E.; Cox, Brady R.; Rathje, Ellen M.; Bachhuber, Jeff; Dulberg, Ranon; Hulslander, David; Christiansen, Lisa; Abrams, Michael J.",pp. 909-921(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000009/art00003;jsessionid=1vli5ghwp3u4s.x-ic-live-02,"We report about a preliminary study to evaluate the use of semi-automated imaging analysis of remotely-sensed DEM and field geophysical measurements to develop a seismic-zonation map of Port-au-Prince, Haiti. For in situ data, Vs30 values are derived from the MASW technique deployed in and around the city. For satellite imagery, we use an ASTER GDEM of Hispaniola. We apply both pixel- and object-based imaging methods on the ASTER GDEM to explore local topography (absolute elevation values) and classify terrain types such as mountains, alluvial fans and basins/near-shore regions. We assign NEHRP seismic site class ranges based on available Vs30 values. A comparison of results from imagery-based methods to results from traditional geologic-based approaches reveals good overall correspondence. We conclude that image analysis of RS data provides reliable first-order site characterization results in the absence of local data and can be useful to refine detailed site maps with sparse local data."

All DLR/ZKI damage maps are based on a specific analysis approach, including preprocessing procedures and visual interpretation on a grid-basis. As the satellite-based mapping response globally was so extensive for this event, problems resulting from the large number and inconsistency of satellite maps generated internationally are addressed. In order to avoid this kind of “mapping challenge” in future the setting-up of an international working group to elaborate global guidelines and cooperation procedures for better coherence of international satellite rapid mapping efforts for extreme events such as the Haiti earthquake is suggested."

Damaged buildings are identified by changes to their shadows between pre- and post-event data. The approach makes use of object-based image analysis concepts to extract relevant information on damage distribution. The methodology selected requires preand post-disaster images with similar sun angles and will only be suitable for the detection of collapsed (or partly collapsed) structures. The new methodology proved to be effective for the Carrefour area despite using satellite images of different qualities with inadequate image (co-)registration, producing positively validated results within an acceptable processing time, and was, to the best of our knowledge, the only automated damage assessment method to have delivered appropriate results to requesting relief organizations within a few days of the Haiti earthquake."

Mars Rover Localization based on Feature Matching between Ground and Orbital Imagery,"Di, Kaichang; Liu, Zhaoqin; Yue, Zongyu",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000008/art00001;jsessionid=1vfbhbsz8ar9r.x-ic-live-02,"Mars rover localization is usually realized with data from odometers, inertial measurement units, and stereo cameras. Location errors accumulate inevitably during any long-range rover traverse when data from only these ground-based sensors is employed. This paper presents a new approach to rover localization based on feature extraction and matching between ground (rover) and orbital imagery. This new approach can localize the rover in orbital imagery, eliminating the accumulated localization error and thereby improving the localization accuracy for long range rover traverse. The proposed approach is tested using NAVCAM images acquired by the Spirit and Opportunity rovers at multiple positions along with HIRISE orbital imagery covering the two landing sites. Results show that this new approach is effective in areas where there are outstanding rocks or outcroppings. The accuracy of this new localization approach is better than one pixel of the HIRISE image (which is 0.25 m)."

For both the original reflectance and a continuum removed dataset, least angle regression (LARS) and random forest classification were used to identify a single set of optimal wavelengths across all sampled dates, a set of optimal wavelengths for each date, and the dates for which Ailanthus is most separable from other species. Leaf classification accuracy was found to vary with both dates and bands used. Contrary to expectations that early spring would provide the best separability, July and August were also identified as potentially good months for species differentiation. Applying continuum removal generally reduced classification error. Band selection using LARS improved classification accuracy. The optimal spectral bands were selected from across the spectrum, typically including 401 to 431 nm, 1,115 nm, and 1,985 to 1,995 nm."

This system consists of a digital, off-the-shelf camera and a laser distance meter which is mounted on an in-house support that permits independent orientation of the distance meter. Combining the image, the distance and the support orientation from different points of view, we can obtain a scaled 3D model that permits us to make an inventory of a building under construction with a relative error below 0.7 percent."

The inherent characteristics of Eucalypt crowns are challenging to remotely sensed tree crown extraction. This paper develops and applies an object-based tree crown delineation approach suitable for estimating canopy cover of Eucalypts in tropical savannas. A two level segmentation was undertaken upon QuickBird data. First, a broad segmentation masked out non-Eucalypt dominant communities; and second, a finer segmentation and ruleset identified seed objects within crowns, and then expanded these objects to cover entire crown extents. Of the 1,604 tree crowns manually observed within the scene, 84.3 percent were detected by the automated seed identification process. Seventy-five percent of tree crowns extracted through the region growing process show strong overlap with their corresponding reference crowns. Results indicate the potential of this method for delineating tree crowns from Eucalypt dominant savanna and the use of this information to estimate canopy cover and tree distribution patterns."

This paper describes a new empirical method of comparing range extraction and discrimination performance of different algorithms, based on a ranging-lab setup with multiple, adjustable screen targets, with precisely-measured separations. We present the results of comparing three different algorithms described in the scientific literature. The results show distinct differences and also indicate that there is no “one-size-fits-all” approach: the choice of a specific algorithm and adjustable parameter settings are highly application-dependent."

The time of day is indicated by the filmed images of clocks. Measurements of a surviving building and of its shadows within the film, along with a solar position calculator, indicate the time of year was early spring. A different shadow feature, independent of the building’s current measurements (other than its orientation), indicates that the film was most likely shot between 24 March and 30 March 1906."
A Triangulation-based Hierarchical Image Matching Method for Wide-Baseline Images,"Wu, Bo; Zhang, Yunsheng; Zhu, Qing",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000007/art00001;jsessionid=d11fq1cpem0k9.x-ic-live-03,"This paper presents a triangulation-based hierarchical image matching method for wide-baseline images. The method includes the following three steps: (a) image orientation by incorporating the SIFT algorithm with the RANSAC approach, (b) feature matching based on the self-adaptive triangle constraint, which includes point-to-point matching and subsequent point-to-area matching, and (c) triangulation constrained dense matching based on the previous matched results. Two new constraints, the triangulation-based disparity constraint and triangulation-based gradient orientation constraint, are developed to alleviate the matching ambiguity for wide-baseline images. A triangulation based affine-adaptive cross-correlation is developed to help find correct matches even in the image regions with large perspective distortions. Experiments using Mars ground wide-baseline images and terrestrial wide-baseline images revealed that the proposed method is capable of generating reliable and dense matching results for terrain mapping and surface reconstruction from the wide-baseline images."

This is essential for implementing carbon crediting programs for ameliorating the effects of global warming. Although none of the developed models was powerful in predicting SOC, a stepwise regression model was selected since it provided the lowest validation root mean square error (RMSE) of 10.4 metric tons per hectare (ton/ha). Using this model, a SOC map for the basin was constructed by applying map algebra. The total SOC content to 0.2 m depth of the basin was calculated to be 9,423,986.4 metric tons with SOC density of 26.3 ton/ha. This study suggested that, in semi-arid environments and using the statistical modeling techniques that were tested, TM-based SOC models cannot be used for implementing carbon crediting programs; however, they can estimate total surface SOC pools in large areas to within a few percent error."
A Multidirectional and Multiscale Morphological Index for Automatic Building Extraction from Multispectral GeoEye-1 Imagery,"Huang, Xin; Zhang, Liangpei",pp. 721-732(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000007/art00003;jsessionid=d11fq1cpem0k9.x-ic-live-03,"This study proposes a novel morphological building index (MBI) for automatic building extraction from high-resolution remotely sensed imagery. The basic idea of MBI is to build a relationship between the implicit characteristics of buildings (e.g., brightness, size, and contrast) and the properties of morphological operators (e.g., reconstruction, granulometry, and directionality). Buildings are extracted by performing a threshold on the MBI feature image. Subsequently, the shape features, such as area and length-width ratio, are used to refine the binary building map. In order to validate the proposed algorithm, a comparative study was performed between MBI, a recently developed texture-derived built-up presence index (PanTex), and the widely used object-based approach. Experiments were conducted on a multispectral GeoEye-1 image, covering a study area of 5.5 km by 5.3 km in Hongshan district of Wuhan, central China. In experiments, MBI achieved satisfactory results and outperformed other algorithms in terms of both accuracies and visual inspection. The effects of parameters of MBI were also analyzed in detail, including directions, sizes and the binaryzation threshold."
A Support Vector Regression Approach to Estimate Forest Biophysical Parameters at the Object Level Using Airborne Lidar Transects and QuickBird Data,"Chen, Gang; Hay, Geoffrey J.",pp. 733-741(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000007/art00004;jsessionid=d11fq1cpem0k9.x-ic-live-03,"A potential solution to reduce high acquisition costs for airborne lidar (light detection and ranging) data is to combine lidar transects and optical satellite imagery to characterize forest vertical structure. Although multiple regression is typically used for such modeling, it seldom fully captures the complex relationships between forest variables. In an effort to improve these relationships, this study investigated the potential of Support Vector Regression (SVR), a machine learning technique, to generalize (lidar-measured) forest canopy height from four lidar transects (representing 8.8 percent, 17.6 percent, 26.4 percent and 35.2 percent area of the site) to the entire study area using QuickBird imagery. The best estimated canopy height was then linked with field measurements to predict actual canopy height, above-ground biomass (AGB) and volume. GEOgraphic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) was used to generate all estimates at a small tree/cluster level with a mean object size (MOS) of 0.04 ha for conifer and deciduous trees. Results show that for all lidar transect samples, SVR models achieved better performance for estimating canopy height than multiple regression. By using SVR and a single lidar transect (i.e., 8.8 percent of the study area), the following relationships were found between predicted and field-measured canopy height (R2: 0.81; RMSE: 4.0 m), AGB (R2: 0.76; RMSE: 63.1 Mg/ha) and volume (R2: 0.64; RMSE: 156.9 m3/ha)."
A Slope-based Method for Matching Elevation Surfaces,"Streutker, David R.; Glenn, Nancy F.; Shrestha, Rupesh",pp. 743-750(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000007/art00005;jsessionid=d11fq1cpem0k9.x-ic-live-03,"A method is presented for the co-registration of overlapping elevation surfaces based on local slope analysis. Comparison and statistical analysis of local slope versus local elevation difference between overlapping surfaces allows for the estimation of both vertical and horizontal offsets between the two surfaces. This method is then used to re-align the flightlines of a Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) dataset collected in southern Idaho resulting in a dataset with significantly higher accuracy than the original. The relative horizontal accuracy is doubled, with a final value of approximately 25 to 30 cm, while the relative vertical accuracy is improved by several centimeters to a final value of approximately 6 to 7 cm."

Next, the data sets were compared to each another using a variety of criteria. Finally, automated methods were used to create maps of propeller scars and the accuracy of each map was analyzed. Significant findings include• Digital airborne ADS40-52, DMC, and ULTRACAM imagery can be used to effectively map benthic habitat and propeller scars.• Imagery from the DMC and ADS40-52 had the highest spatial accuracy.• Spectral separatability of benthic habitat class and propeller scars is best in the DMC and the ADS40-52 imagery.• The accuracy of propeller scar maps was highest for maps produced from the ADS40-52 data."
A “New Hybrid” Modeling for Geometric Processing of Radarsat-2 data without User’s GCP,"Toutin, Thierry; Omari, Khalid",pp. 601-608(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000006/art00002;jsessionid=25w9qb0l9b77n.x-ic-live-03,"The objective of the research study is to use the synergy of 3D empirical (Rational Function Model (RFM) and physical (Toutin’s) geometric models to develop a “new hybrid” model for the geometric processing of Radarsat-2 data without collecting ground control point (GCP). After independently evaluating the processing and the accuracy of each model using accurate differential GPS points, RFM was thus used to generate few “virtual” RFM points at the highest elevation of the study site. In addition to information of the metadata, these “virtual” points were input as GCPs in Toutin’s model. This “new hybrid model consistently achieved pixel accuracy, with better results for steep looking angles than the two other models. Its main advantage was, in addition, to be used without collecting GCP, increasing the applicability of Radarsat-2 data in remote areas."

As a basic research topic in photogrammetry and computer vision, it is desirable to perform a comprehensive investigation on the accuracy and automation of wide-baseline mapping. This paper presents the results of a systematic accuracy analysis of wide-baseline mapping through theoretical derivation and Monte Carlo simulation. Automated bundle adjustment and 3D wide-baseline mapping techniques are developed and tested using wide-baseline images acquired by the Spirit Rover. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques and verify that the mapping capability of rover stereo images can be extended from tens of meters (hard-baseline) to hundreds of meters using wide-baseline mapping techniques."
ASTER/Terra Imagery and a Multilevel Semantic Network for Semi-automated Classification of Landforms in a Subtropical Area,"Camargo, F.F.; Almeida, C.M.; Florenzano, T.G.; Heipke, C.; Feitosa, R.Q.; Costa, G.A.O.P.",pp. 619-629(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000006/art00004;jsessionid=25w9qb0l9b77n.x-ic-live-03,"This research is committed to develop a semi-automated landforms classification method for a subtropical area located in the southeast of Brazil, using optical medium-resolution imagery from ASTER/Terra. A four-level semantic network driven by a set of spectral, textural, and geomorphometric variables was used. The textural and geomorpho-metric variables were extracted from an ASTER/Terra DEM. The semantic network was initially conceived to classify macro morphogenetic landforms and was then further detailed to allow a finer classification, which amounted to eleven classes of morphographic landforms. In order to assess the classification accuracy, statistical indices were derived from a contingency table obtained by means of a comparison between the classified scene and a reference map. The final agreement indices for the macro and detailed landforms classifications were 76 percent and 80 percent, respectively. The employed object-based image analysis has proved to be a suitable method for semiautomated procedures in the classification of landforms."
Precise Orthoimage Generation of Dunhuang Wall Painting,"Zhang, Yongjun; Zhang, Zuxun; Sun, Mingwei; Ke, Tao",pp. 631-640(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000006/art00005;jsessionid=25w9qb0l9b77n.x-ic-live-03,"Wall painting plays an important role in the culture relics of the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang, P.R. China. A novel approach of generating a high-resolution orthoimage of the wall painting is proposed. Since the photographic object is nearly flat and also the forward overlap between adjacent images is smaller than 60 percent, the main difficulty to be resolved is the high correlation problem among the unknowns. Improved models of relative orientation and bundle adjustment with virtual constraints have been developed to resolve the high correlation problem. A Voronoi diagram of projective footprints is applied to automatically determine the mosaic lines of ortho-rectified images. The color quality of the generated orthoimage is improved through global minimization of the color differences among overlapped images. The experimental results show that the proposed approach has great potential for conservation of wall paintings with sub-millimeter to millimeter precision."
Mapping Evapotranspiration from ASTER Data through GIS Spatial Integration of Vegetation and Terrain Features,"Mariotto, Isabella; Gutschick, Vincent P.; Clason, Dennis L.",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000005/art00001;jsessionid=1pduln9b2bi9x.x-ic-live-01,"Accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) is difficult to obtain over heterogeneous landscapes presenting spectrally diverse land covers and topographic terrains. The goal of this study is to build advanced remote sensing and surface energy balance algorithms to map ET in a heterogeneous semi-arid area. ET of 12 different land covers is computed by applying the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) modified for roughness, vegetation index, and topographic-corrected reflectance, with comparison to the JIC model. A GIS raster/vector platform is used to integrate multispectral thermal and reflectance imagery with meteorological, terrain, land-cover, and astronomical data. SEBAL computed with all the modifications showed the best agreement with the ground measurements, compared to the SEBAL versions without any single modification, and it could significantly discriminate ET among 75.8 percent of vegetation types (at threshold differences in ET >0.5 mm/day). SEBAL without any modifications could not discriminate any vegetation types."
A New Stereo Algorithm based on Snakes,"Simioni, Emanuele; Naletto, Giampiero; Forlani, Gianfranco; Cremonese, Gabriele; Da Deppo, Vania; Massironi, Matteo; Segato, Elisa",pp. 495-507(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000005/art00002;jsessionid=1pduln9b2bi9x.x-ic-live-01,"As part of the ongoing activities for the European space mission BepiColombo to Mercury, a new stereo-matching algorithm is here proposed: this algorithm uses deformable surfaces, or snakes, to find a dense disparity map. Subject to both external and internal forces, respectively represented by the similarity function and by smoothness constraints on the disparity map, a “deformable” disparity map evolves from an initial approximate state to an optimal one in which the algorithm has reached convergence.This algorithm is expected to provide one of the image matching tools for the Digital Terrain Model generation procedure that will be used by the BepiColombo stereo camera. To check the algorithm, tests have been performed on synthetic images derived from3Dmodels of geological features relevant to planetary science. The results show that it is possible to obtain an image measurement accuracy comparable to the one attainable with the Least Squares Matching algorithm. In addition, less object smoothing can be obtained since the object points are not derived by a large scale averaging over a terrain patch, as for example, in area-based methods; this means that more details of the terrain can be captured. Finally, because of the continuity constraint, this method is also expected to be robust in case of blunders in the reconstruction of the parallax field."

Lineament analysis using satellite imagery was employed to identify surface expressions of subsurface fracturing for possible new well locations. An imagery integration approach was developed to evaluate satellite imagery for lineament analysis in terrain where the influences of human development and vegetation confound lineament interpretation. Four satellite sensors (ASTER, Landsat-7 ETM+, QuickBird, RADARSAT-1) and a DEM were used for lineament mapping a volcanic region of Nicaragua. Image processing and interpretations obtained 12 complementary products, which were synthesized into a raster image of lineament-zone coincidence for creating a lineament delineation map. Nine of the 11 previously mapped faults were identified from the coincidence-based map along with 26 new lineaments. The locations of ten new lineaments were confirmed by field observation. RADARSAT-1 products were best for minimizing anthropogenic features but not able to identify all the geological lineaments."

The results demonstrated that discrete return, small-footprint lidar with high point density (9.46 points/m2) can provide strong predictions of true sagebrush height (R2of 0.84 to 0.86), but with a consistent underestimation of approximately 30 percent. Our results provided the first successful lidar-based descriptors of sagebrush shape with R2values of 0.65, 0.74, and 0.78 for respective predictions of shortest canopy diameter, longest canopy diameter, and canopy area. Future studies can extend lidar-derived shrub height and shape measurements to canopy volume, cover, and biomass estimates."

This paper explains the methodology of expanding a sensor model for in-orbit geometric calibration of the PRISM radiometers on the Japanese ALOS satellite. PRISM has three optical systems for forward, nadir, and backward views each with a 2.5 m nominal spatial resolution. Algorithms for the geometric processing of the PRISM images are proposed and implemented. It is shown how self calibration and orientation of the sensor can be done without having precise knowledge of the payload geometry and attitude data. Several cases and procedures are studied with the established sensor model, including weight matrices, attitude offsets, attitude drifts, and focal length estimations. It is concluded that self calibration of the PRISM cameras can be done effectively with a rigorous sensor model. Even if the post-launch parameters are not available, sub-pixel geometric accuracy can be achieved."

The OB-MAD method, which utilizes shape and textural information of objects derived from MAD components, produced the highest accuracy with respect to wetland change detection and successfully minimized the influence from the geometric distortion and shadow on the changed area."

An initial, empirical assessment of the accuracy and characteristics of the GDEM was carried out using a globally-distributed sample dataset. Statistical and visual analyses of the GDEM, using known reference DEMs and ground control points (GCPs) for comparison, revealed a systematic bias in the ASTER GDEM elevations, higher average noise levels, and a lower effective ground resolution compared to the reference data, as well as numerous topo-graphic artifacts and anomalies. The GDEM appears to meet its accuracy specifications when compared to the reference DEMs, but compared to the GCPs, some of the areas are questionable. In areas that lack good quality terrain data, the GDEM may prove useful, but must be used with care."

These image-derived parameters are evaluated against those from in situ measurements at 244 SNOTEL stations in the Pacific Northwest, during the 2006 to 2008 hydrological years. Results indicate that biases are mainly from scale difference between images and in situ observations and that the Method 2/MODISMC8 combination performs the best. Three SCD maps (one for each year) have very similar distribution patterns, although the SCOD and SCED maps vary from year to year and from area to area."
A Genetic Programming Approach to Estimate Vegetation Cover in the Context of Soil Erosion Assessment,"Puente, Cesar; Olague, Gustavo; Smith, Stephen V.; Bullock, Stephen H.; Hinojosa-Corona, Alejandro; González-Botello, Miguel A.",pp. 363-376(14),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000004/art00004;jsessionid=wggdb2vrg0oj.x-ic-live-03,"This work describes a genetic programming (GP) approach that creates vegetation indices (VI’s) to automatically detect the sum of healthy, dry, and dead vegetation. Nowadays, it is acknowledged that VI’s are the most popular method for extracting vegetation information from satellite imagery. In particular, erosion models like the “Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation” (RUSLE) can use VI’s as input to measure the effects of the RUSLE soil cover factor (C). However, the results are generally incomplete, because most indices recognize only healthy vegetation. The aim of this study is to devise a novel approach for designing new VI’s that are better - correlated with C, using field and satellite information. Our approach consists on stating the problem in terms of optimization through GP learning, building novel indices by iteratively recombining a set of numerical operators and spectral channels until the best composite operator is found. Experimental results illustrate the efficiency and reliability of our approach in contrast with traditional indices like those of the NDVI and SAVI family. This study provides evidence that similar problems related to soil erosion assessment could be analyzed with our proposed methodology."

Several historical databases have been simulated to assess the influence and significance of this feature in the classification. The causes, nature, and evolution of classification errors as the database currency varies are analyzed; and the impact of these errors on change detection during the updating process is evaluated. The results show that the addition of historical land-use information increases the overall accuracy of image classifications. During a database updating process, changes are detected by comparing the historical land-use with the classification results. The main drawback of employing historical land-use as a descriptive feature in image classification for change detection is that the percentage of undetectable errors significantly increases as more accurate is the database information."
Automated Methods for Measuring DBH and Tree Heights with a Commercial Scanning Lidar,"Huang, Huabing; Li, Zhan; Gong, Peng; Cheng, Xiao; Clinton, Nick; Cao, Chunxiang; Ni, Wenjian; Wang, Lei",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000003/art00001;jsessionid=357adqh4ajvep.x-ic-live-03,"Accurate forest structural parameters are crucial to forest inventory, and modeling of the carbon cycle and wildlife habitat. Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) is particularly suitable to the measurement of forest structural parameters. In this paper, we describe a pilot study to extract forest structural parameters, such as tree height, diameter at breast height (DBH), and position of individual tree using a terrestrial lidar (LMS-Z360i; Riegel, Inc.). The lidar was operated to acquire both vertical and horizontal scanning in the field in order to obtain a point cloud of the whole scene. An Iterative Closet Point (ICP) algorithm was introduced to obtain the transformation matrix of each range image and to mosaic multiple range images together. Based on the mosaiced data set, a variable scale and threshold filtering method was used to separate ground from the vegetation. Meanwhile, a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and a Canopy Height Model (CHM) were generated from the classified point cloud. A stem detection algorithm was used to extract the location of individual trees. A slice above 1.3 m from the ground was extracted and rasterized. A circle fitting algorithm combined with the Hough transform was used to retrieve the DBH based on the rasterized grid. Tree heights were calculated using the height difference between the minimum and maximum Z values within the position of each individual tree with a 1 m buffer. All of the 26 trees were detected correctly, tree height and DBH were determined with a precision of 0.76 m and 3.4 cm, respectively, comparing with those visually measured in the lidar data. Our methods and results confirm that terrestrial lidar can provide nondestructive, high-resolution, and automatic determination of parameters required in forest inventory."

We evaluate the potential of automatically extracted skeletons from terrestrial lidar data as a basis for modeling canopy structure. The automatic and species independent evaluation method for lidar data of trees is based on the SKELTRE algorithm. The SKELTRE skeleton is a graphical representation of the branch hierarchy. The extraction of the branch hierarchy utilizes a graph splitting procedure to extract the branches from the skeleton. Analyzing the distance between the point cloud points and the skeleton is the key to the branch diameter. Frequency distributions of branch length and diameter were chosen to test the algorithm performance in comparison to manually measured data and resulted in a correlation of up to 0.78 for the branch length and up to 0.99 for the branch diameter.

MMAC is a generalized tree crown mapping algorithm which can accommodate multiple heads in a crown as well as overlapping crowns. The MMAC algorithm comprises three steps: bottom up erosion (BUE) which identifies stand candidates, top down dilation (TDD) which estimates the crown periphery, and an active contour model (ACM) which delineates crown contours. Three sample plots were selected in Alishan National Scenic Area, Taiwan, (predominantly alder, sugi, and red cypress) for evaluation of the algorithm. When compared with ground survey data, the algorithm achieved an average detection accuracy of 24 percent omission error and 13 percent commission error in identifying individual trees in mountainous forest stands. Detection accuracy is potentially related to stand density."

The normalization is data-driven, can be fully automated, and involves scaling differences in observed intensity between returns collocated in space but registered to different laser scanning swaths. The scaling is proportional to the overall rate of attenuation f of laser energy. The utility of this approach for applications of lidar over forests was evaluated by examining classification results of broad cover types obtained using observed and normalized intensity measurements in an Oregon study area. The normalization was more effective for single returns, leading to a 53 percent reduction in intensity coefficient of variation between observed and range-normalized measurements. The poor cover type classification accuracy (44.4 percent; kappa 0.167) obtained by using observed intensities of first returns improved substantially to 75.6 percent (kappa 0.624) when using above-ground, single returns and f = 2.04."

To assess how well these indices are able to capture the vertical structure of forest stands, they are compared to Oliver and Larson’s (1996) four stages of forest stand development. Best subsets regressions indicated that no single index is able to separate all four stages adequately. However, the predicted Lorey’s height index is optimal for separating early from mid succession stages (p<.0001) and a combination of height and complexity indices performed best to discriminate between mid- and late-succession stages (p<.0001)."

Their potential use as observational inputs to models is demonstrated using a wind-risk model for the UK, ForestGALES. Relative heights above ground were used as biophysical parameter estimators. Top Height was estimated with R2=0.73, RMSE=4.5 m. Diameter at breast height estimates differed for conifer-dominated stands (R2=0.72, RMSE=0.07 m) and for stands containing mostly broadleaves (R2=0.41, RMSE=0.11 m). Ground elevation estimation produced R2=0.997, RMSE=2.2 m. These three parameters were applied to ForestGALES for stand-level assessment of wind-throw risk. Stability is sensitive to small differences in tree dimensions, and therefore vegetation parameters require greater accuracy than those currently retrievable from GLAS to more reliably determine risk of wind-throw. Future satellite lidar missions such as NASA’s DESDynI sensor aim to produce improved vegetation parameter estimation plus greater spatial coverage which would offer more appropriate inputs for forestry models."

Two types of metrics hypothesized to have relationship with forest types were derived from the canopy return part of the waveform. The first type of metrics is quantile-based metrics reflecting the vertical distribution of canopy return energy, and the second type is statistical characteristics of the Gaussian components of canopy return part. Support Vector Machine classification was applied to different combinations of the metrics to find their relationship with different forest types. The results showed that the second type of metrics, indicating the canopy stratum characteristics, showed great promise in separating broad-leaved and needle-leaved forests with the accuracy ranging from 88.68 percent to 90.57 percent and Kappa statistic from 0.7406 to 0.7868."

First, a new algorithm is introduced for determination of principal orientations of a building, thus benefiting to improve the correctness and robustness of boundary segment extraction in aerial imagery. A new dynamic selection strategy based on lidar point density analysis and K-means clustering is then proposed to identify boundary segments from non-boundary segments. Second, 3D boundary segments are determined by incorporating lidar data and the 2D segments extracted from multi-view imagery. Finally, a new strategy for 3D building model reconstruction including automatic recovery of lost boundaries and robust reconstruction of rooftop patches is introduced. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach can provide high quality 3D models with high-correctness, high-completeness, and good geometric accuracy."
National Land-Cover Data and Census of Agriculture Estimates of Agricultural Land-Use Area Differ in the Northeastern United States,"Goslee, Sarah C.",pp. 141-147(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000002/art00002;jsessionid=1qk021m9mui8k.x-ic-live-01,"The landscape of the northeastern United States is a complex mixture of forest, agriculture, and development. Many urgent social and environmental issues require spatially-referenced information on land-use, a need potentially met by the National Land-Cover Data (NLCD). NLCD non-site-specific accuracy from 1992 and 2001 was assessed by comparing county proportions of cropland and agricultural grassland (pasture/hay) area to those recorded in the USDA Census of Agriculture (COA) for 1992 and 2002. Estimates of total agricultural area corresponded closely (r2= 0.91 for 1992; 0.85 for 2001/2), but NLCD performed poorly at distinguishing between cropland and grassland (r2= 0.64 and 0.80 for cropland in 1992 and 2001; 0.50 and 0.44 for grassland in those years). High forest cover reduced accuracy. Landscape complexity and patch size may impede classification accuracy. Accuracy varied greatly by state, even within a single mapping region. The NLCD is the best available source of spatial land-cover, but may not be suitable for applications requiring agricultural subclass data."
Sub-canopy Soil Moisture Modeling in n-Dimensional Spectral Feature Space,"Ghulam, Abduwasit; Kusky, Timothy M.; Teyip, Tashpolat; Qin, Qiming",pp. 149-156(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000002/art00003;jsessionid=1qk021m9mui8k.x-ic-live-01,"This paper attempts to quantify soil moisture in various canopy cover conditions using n-dimensional spectral signatures, including land surface temperature, vegetation index, albedo, and others. First, the feature vector between the pixels and various moisture contents was indentified. Normalization of the varying distance from a user-defined initial state to any pixel location, and coefficients related with n-dimensional spectral feature space were calculated, assigning weights to each parameter. Then, a soil moisture index was developed using a linear combination of the first order polynomials. The Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (eFAST) was used to calculate the relative variance contribution of model input parameters to the variance of soil moisture predictions. Results derived from satellite data including Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery demonstrated significant correlations between the index and soil moisture obtained for different ecosystems and vegetation cover. The best agreement, the coefficient of determination (R2), between the index and soil moisture were 0.58 and 0.65 for ETM+ and MODIS data, respectively. eFAST sensitivity analysis indicates that land surface temperature might be the most determinant factor in soil moisture estimation, then albedo, followed by NDVI."
Validation of ASTER GDEM for the Area of Greece,"Chrysoulakis, N.; Abrams, M.; Kamarianakis, Y.; Stanislawski, M.",pp. 157-165(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000002/art00004;jsessionid=1qk021m9mui8k.x-ic-live-01,"The ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM), which was released in June 2009, provides elevation data for over 99 percent of Earth’s land area. GDEM was found to contain significant anomalies mainly caused by residual clouds in the ASTER scenes, or by the algorithm used to generate the final GDEM from the variable number of individual DEMs. In this paper, the GDEM, for the whole area of Greece was validated by comparing it with reference DEMs with higher resolution derived either from aerial stereo imagery, or from ASTER raw data analysis; as well as with elevation values provided by a number of Geodetic Control Points (GCP) and GPS measurements. The vertical accuracy (at 95 percent confidence) was calculated to be more than 30 m (RMSE = 16.01 m) when compared to the GCPs, whereas the vertical accuracy was calculated around 20 m (RMSE = 11.08 m) when compared with the GPS derived elevations. It can be therefore stated that the current version of ASTER GDEM overall does not meet its pre-production estimated vertical accuracy of 20 m at 95 percent confidence over Greece, however, it can be used in several applications, such as topographic analysis, hydrological and geomorphological modeling, landscape visualization, and energy balance studies."
A Genetic Algorithm Approach to Moving Threshold Optimization for Binary Change Detection,"Im, Jungho; Lu, Zhenyu; Jensen, John R.",pp. 167-180(14),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000002/art00005;jsessionid=1qk021m9mui8k.x-ic-live-01,"This study investigated the use of a genetic algorithm (GA) approach, a widely used optimization method, to identify optimum thresholds for remote sensing-based binary change detection. Automated GA-based calibration models using a moving threshold window (MTW) were developed and tested using a case study. Two sets of the bi-temporal QuickBird imagery were used to evaluate the new optimization models. The GA-based models using MTW were free from the assumption of symmetry of thresholds for difference- or ratio-type of change-enhanced images, unlike traditional binary change detection methods, allowing more flexibility and efficiency in selecting optimum thresholds. Exhaustive search techniques using symmetric threshold window (STW) and MTW were evaluated for comparison. The stability of the GA-based models in terms of accuracy variation was also examined. The GA-based calibration models successfully identified optimum thresholds without a significant decrease in accuracy. The GA-based models using MTW outperformed the GA-based model using STW in both calibration and validation, revealing that optimum thresholds tended to be asymmetric. Multiple change-enhanced images generally resulted in better performance than single change-enhanced images based on the GA-based models."
Utilizing Temporally Invariant Calibration Sites to Classify Multiple Dates and Types of Satellite Imagery,"Fortier, Joe; Rogan, John; Woodcock, Curtis E.; Runfola, Daniel Miller",pp. 181-189(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000002/art00006;jsessionid=1qk021m9mui8k.x-ic-live-01,"Mapping past time periods (retrospective mapping) using remotely sensed data is hindered by a lack of coincident calibration and validation information. The identification of features of same ground cover invariant across time and their use as calibration and validation data addresses this challenge by: (a) streamlining the process of image calibration for multiple dates, and (b) allowing each image to generate its own spectral signature. This study investigates the use of temporally invariant calibration and validation data to map land-cover in Massachusetts, employing five satellite images collected from five separate dates and different sensors. The results indicate that this technique can be used to produce land cover classifications of similar overall map accuracy to published mapping studies. Classification accuracy using this method is highly dependent on the characteristics (radiometric, spectral, and spatial) of the satellite imagery."
Parameterizing Support Vector Machines for Land Cover Classification,"Yang, Xiaojun",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000001/art00001;jsessionid=2049trf6kmaic.x-ic-live-02,"The support vector machine is a group of relatively novel statistical learning algorithms that have not been extensively exploited in the remote sensing community. In previous studies they have been found to generally outperform some popular classifiers. Several recent studies found that training samples and input data dimensionalities can affect image classification accuracies by those popular classifiers and support vector machines alike. The current study extends beyond these recent research frameworks and into another important inquiry area addressing the impacts of internal parameterization on the performance of support vector machines for land-cover classification. A set of support vector machines with different combinations of kernel types, parameters, and error penalty are carefully constructed to classify a Landsat Thematic Mapper image into eight major land-cover categories using identical training data. The accuracy of each classified map is further evaluated using identical reference data. The results reveal that kernel types and error penalty can substantially affect the classification accuracy, and that a careful selection of parameter settings can help improve the performance of the support vector classification. These findings reported here can help establish a practical guidance on the use of support vector machines for land-cover classification from remote sensor data."
Modeling the Probability of Misclassification in a Map of Land Cover Change,"Burnicki, Amy C.",pp. 39-49(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000001/art00002;jsessionid=2049trf6kmaic.x-ic-live-02,"An empirical model was developed to produce a spatially-explicit classification error probability surface for a map of land-cover change resulting from post-classification change analysis. The role of contextual information in predicting change classification error was assessed by testing the significance of variables identifying the absence or presence of classification error in the time-series maps and variables describing landscape composition and structure. A generalized additive model relating errors in classifying change to the series of predictor variables successfully explained over 90 percent of model residual deviance. Predictors capturing the location of classification error in the time-series were the primary determinants of change classification error. However, several predictors describing landscape characteristics were included in the final model. Their inclusion resulted in a sharper delineation between low- and high-error probability regions and a better understanding of the nature of change classification error."
Comparison of Global- and Local-scale Pansharpening for Rapid Assessment of Humanitarian Emergencies,"Kim, Minho; Holt, James B.; Madden, Marguerite",pp. 51-63(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000001/art00003;jsessionid=2049trf6kmaic.x-ic-live-02,"We compared global-scale pansharpening of full- or large-scene QuickBird satellite imagery with local-scale pansharpening of a subset of these scenes by using modified intensity-hue-saturation (MIHS), principal component analysis (PCA), multiplicative (MP), and high pass filter (HPF) methods. The spectral properties of all pansharpened images were evaluated by using quantitative indices such as erreur relative globale adimensionnelle de synthèse (ERGAS), correlation coefficient (CC), relative difference to mean (RDM), and relative difference to standard deviation (RDS). This study discovered that local-scale pansharpening was generally lower and higher than the global-scale approach in terms of ERGAS and CC, respectively. In particular, local-scale HPF produced pansharpening results very close to the original multispectral image with less than 0.18 percent and 0.07 percent of RDM and RDS, respectively. Local-scale fusion results with PCA and MP were similar to those of the global-scale approach. Local-scale pansharpening that uses very high spatial resolution imagery could lead to the rapid assessment of the magnitude and severity of humanitarian situations by producing a color image of high spatial resolution with reduced processing time."
Remote Sensing Classification Using Fractal Dimensions over a Subtropical Hilly Region,"Zhu, Ji; Shi, Jiancheng; Chu, Hanfang; Hu, Jiawen; Li, Xiaozhou; Li, Wei",pp. 65-74(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000001/art00004;jsessionid=2049trf6kmaic.x-ic-live-02,"Subtropical hilly regions in China have various and complex surface features, which are difficult to identify in remote-sensing images. A new algorithm for calculating the fractal dimension of a single pixel of a remote-sensing image is presented. The fractal dimension data for a scene captured in an ETM+(i.e., Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) image were used to compose a new image together with the second and fourth bands of the ETM+image. Using the new image, the land-use/land-cover types and forest categories in the region were identified using a maximum likelihood classification. The accuracy assessment of the classification gave an overall accuracy of 80.69 percent and a Khatvalue of 0.78. The proposed method is a little more accurate than the method that does not use fractal dimension data, especially for identification of different types of vegetation in the region."
Delineation of Impervious Surface from Multispectral Imagery and Lidar Incorporating Knowledge Based Expert System Rules,"Germaine, Kreh A.; Hung, Ming-Chih",pp. 75-85(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2011/00000077/00000001/art00005;jsessionid=2049trf6kmaic.x-ic-live-02,"An attempt to delineate impervious surfaces in the City of Scottsbluff, Nebraska, was made using multispectral high spatial resolution imagery and lidar data. An ISODATA classification was performed and results aggregated into two parent classes, impervious and pervious. The ISODATA classification yielded an overall accuracy of 91.0 percent with a Kappa of 82.0 percent. A Knowledge Based Expert System (KBES) set of rules was designed incorporating the imagery classification with lidar data to derive two models, Cover Height and Cover Slope, to provide critical information not available from multispectral imagery. The rules were applied to the initial ISODATA classification to improve the classification accuracy to an overall accuracy of 94.0 percent with a Kappa of 87.9 percent. In this study, it was shown that lidar holds promise for improving the accuracy of impervious surface measurement, as well as the potential identification and measurement of other significant planimetric features such as buildings and trees."
Precise Georefrencing of Long Strips of ALOS Imagery,"Fraser, C.

The provision of GCPs can be very costly and is often not feasible in remote regions, the very areas where mapping from satellite imagery shows significant potential. In order to drastically reduce the number of GCPs required for georeferencing from HRSI, a generic sensor orientation model incorporating strip adjustment capability has been adopted. Under this approach, the metadata for each separate scene is merged to produce a single, continuous set of orbit and attitude parameters, such that the entire strip of tens of images can be treated as a single image. The merging of orbit data results in a considerable reduction in both the number of unknown parameters and the number of required GCPs in the sensor orientation. RPCs are then generated from the adjusted orientation data for each image forming the strip or block. Application of the method to very long strips of ALOS PRSIM imagery is reported in this paper. The results of experimental testing indicate that one-pixel level accuracy can be achieved over strip lengths of more than 50 ALOS images, or 1,500 km, with as few as four GCPs."

These images, however, often lack necessary spectral information due to technological limitations. This study integrates spectral information (temperature and moisture) derived from Landsat-7 ETM+ imagery with Ikonos imagery to derive high-resolution impervious surface information. Furthermore, three popular methods, including linear regression modeling, artificial neural network, and regression tree have been developed and compared using a paired t-test statistic. Analysis of results reveal that Tasseled Cap components particularly greenness and wetness of Ikonos imagery are most important in estimating sub-pixel imperviousness. Also, to some extent the brightness temperature derived from Landsat-7 ETM+ image helps in better estimation of impervious surfaces. Moreover, a comparative analysis indicates that the non-linear approaches yielded statistically better results. Particularly, the regression tree model generated best results with highest Pearson’s r (0.939) and lowest mean absolute error (8.307)."
Migration Patterns of Two Endangered Sympatric Species from a Remote Sensing Perspective,"Wang, Tiejun; Skidmore, Andrew K.; Zeng, Zhigao; Beck, Pieter S.A.; Si, Yali; Song, Yanling; Liu, Xuehua; Prins, Herbert H.T.",pp. 1343-1352(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000012/art00002;jsessionid=1eo04pr3jibw2.x-ic-live-01,"Giant pandas(Ailuropoda melanoleuca)and golden takin(Budorcas taxicolor bedfordi)are large mammals that occur together throughout the southern part of the Qinling Mountains in China. Both species have the habit of altitudinal migration in a mixed forest-bamboo landscape. Although previous studies have reported that the migration patterns of giant pandas and golden takin seem different, little is known about these differences in relation to their food quality and quantity. We used radio-telemetry data from six giant pandas and three golden takin groups to determine whether differences in their migration patterns are related to satellitederived plant phenology (a surrogate of food quality) and bamboo abundance (a surrogate of food quantity). Our results suggest that the altitudinal migration patterns of both the giant panda and the golden takin follow the phenological development of plants in the study area, and the difference between them seems to be attributable to the difference in the phenology of bamboo and non-bamboo plants, and thus the abundance and quality of food available to these two species."
A Piecewise Approach to Epipolar Resampling of Pushbroom Satellite Images Based on RPC,"Oh, Jaehong; Lee, Won Hee; Toth, Charles K.; Grejner-Brzezinska, Dorota A.; Lee, Changno",pp. 1353-1363(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000012/art00003;jsessionid=1eo04pr3jibw2.x-ic-live-01,"Epipolar line determination and image resampling are important steps for stereo image processing. Unlike frame cameras that have well-known epipolar geometry, the pushbroom camera does not produce straight epipolar lines and the epipolar pair does not exist for the entire scene. These properties make it difficult to establish epipolar geometry of the pushbroom camera for epipolar image resampling. Therefore, some researchers have adopted approximate models to avoid these problems. In this study, a new method for the conjugate epipolar curve pair determination and epipolar resampling of spaceborne pushbroom images based on RPC is proposed. The proposed method assumes that the conjugate epipolar curve pairs exist approximately for the local scene area and the global epipolar pairs can also exist if the local pairs are sequentially linked. Then, epipolar image resampling is established by reassigning the generated conjugate epipolar curve pair points to satisfy the epipolar resampling image condition. Ikonos stereo images are tested for the evaluation, and the proposed method showed a maximum y-parallax of 1.25 pixels for manually measured tie points, while the resampling method by the parallel projection model showed a maximum of 4.59 pixels."
Total Variation Methods for Three Dimensional Lidar Image Denoising,"Crosby, Frank; Zhou, Haomin; Huynh, Quyen",pp. 1365-1371(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000012/art00004;jsessionid=1eo04pr3jibw2.x-ic-live-01,"New imaging capabilities have given rise to higher dimensional image processing. This paper presents a generalization of total variation (TV) based denoising model with a specific application to three-dimensional flash lidar imagery. The generalization uses a weighted norm, rather than the standard Euclidean measure, that accounts for sampling differences that may exist along different axes. We compare this new method against successive two-dimensional denoising and three-dimensional TV denoising. The results show that denoising with a weighted norm presents much better object recognition for multi-plane objects compared with both of the other methods. Further, it does not blur single plane objects beyond the result obtained with two-dimensional denoising."

Using a building model enhanced by facade grammar, multiple reflections at building facades are analyzed using ray tracing techniques and scatterers are localized in azimuth, range, and elevation. In a case study, salient signatures of a TerraSAR-X image are analyzed based on simulated SAR reflectivity maps. Phase centers of trihedral reflections are mapped onto the building model and the physical correspondence of scatterers to building features is investigated. Surfaces contributing to salient scatterers are identified at the building model. Eventually, the use of SAR simulation to support PSI is shown from two aspects: (a) for providing a-priori information about building layover, and (b) for extending knowledge about the nature of dominant scatterers."
Reflectance Spectroscopy of Biochemical Components as Indicators of Tea (Camellia Sinensis) Quality,"Bian, Meng; Skidmore, Andrew K.; Schlerf, Martin; Fei, Teng; Liu, Yanfang; Wang, Tiejun",pp. 1385-1392(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000012/art00006;jsessionid=1eo04pr3jibw2.x-ic-live-01,"The potential of reflectance spectroscopy to estimate the concentration of biochemical compounds related to tea (Camellia sinensis (L.)) quality (total tea polyphenols and free amino acids) is demonstrated. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) was performed to establish the relationship between reflectance and biochemicals for leaf powders as well as fresh leaves. Highest accuracy was found for tea powders with a cross-validated r2of 0.97 for tea polyphenols and 0.99 for free amino acids, and the root mean square error of cross validations (RMSECVS) are 8.36 mg g−1and 1.01 mg g−1for the two chemicals. The accuracy achieved at leaf level was slightly lower, with results yielding cross-validated r2of 0.91 and 0.93 with RMSECVS of 13.74 mg g−1and 2.32 mg g−1for tea polyphenols and free amino acids, respectively. Important wavelengths for prediction of the two biochemicals from powder and leaf spectra were identified using the PLSR bcoefficients as indicators. Wavelengths of 1,131 nm, 1,654 nm, 1,666 nm, 1,738 nm and 1,752 nm were identified as bands related to absorption by total tea polyphenols, while 1,492 nm represented the absorption feature of free amino acids. The results obtained using fresh leaves indicate that hyperspectral remote sensing may be useful for routine monitoring of tea chemistry at landscape scale."

Through fusion of environmental data and physical modeling, a vicarious calibration approach was implemented. Results, which were demonstrated to agree with data from previous field campaigns, indicate the Landsat-5 thermal band has been calibrated to better than 1 K over the 24 years in orbit. The data indicate the sensor exhibits a small gain error (approximately constant over time) and a bias shift for all data post-1999. The lifetime calibration error can be reduced to 0.49 K, in reference to a 300 K blackbody, by a pair of linear corrections. This study established that the methodology presented can be implemented to achieve a very high level of radiometric integrity, applicable to both historic and current data from remote thermal infrared systems."

We cmried out experiments with data of two multispectral images: Landsat TM data for a semi-arid area in the Horqin sandy land, China, and ASTER data for the Kasumigaura Lake region, Japan, a high humidity, warm temperature zone. Accuracy assessment of tl1e MSCM results in comparison with those of the suppo1t vector machine (SVM) and maximum likelihood classification (MLC) methods showed that the MSCM yielded better classification results.

Error matrices were calculated using independent validation sites and producer's, user's, and overall accuracy, Kappa Index of Agreement, and transformed divergence were analyzed to compare the performance of each classification and determine detection thresholds. Results indicate a strong relationship between target size and classification accuracy (R2= 0.94) as well as an increasingly prominent role played by training site selection as target size decreased. Strong spectral separability and good classification accuracies were achieved for targets >25 percent cover. Sub-pixel targets <25 percent in size were not detectable. This study highligilts the effect of target size upon classification accuracy and has direct implications for invasive plant research and rare target detection."

Orchards statistics from high-resolution images in Florida and Western Cape province (South Africa) citrus producing areas show that pixel unmixing between adjacent fields can be avoided for pixel sizes below 10 to 15 m, while within fields mixing (canopy, soil, and weeds) is inevitable with multi- and hyperspectral sensors. A virtual 3D environment was constructed in which off-nadir pointing simulations were made for different field orientations. Spectral similarity based contribution indices were derived to find overflight times and viewing angles that reduce the impact of seasonality, soil and weeds. Although no single optimal view direction was found for all scenarios, optimal results in mature orchards were consistently obtained by early acquisitions and low oblique viewing perpendicular to or at a 45° angle with the row orientation, opposite to the solar azimuth."

From the TERRA-ASTER images of Extremadura area (Spain), the Ground Control Point (GCP), ICP, and ICL data were acquired using differential GPS through field survey, and the planimetric positional accuracy was analyzed by both the conventional method (using ICP) and the proposed method (using ICL). Comparing conventional and proposed methods, the results indicated that modulus statistics are similar (e.g., RMSE of Geometric Correction 1 were 17.5 for the conventional method and 17.2 m for proposed method). But as additional results, azimuthal component statistics was calculated (e.g., mean direction: 247.2° in Geometric Correction 1), and several tests were made which showed the error distribution are not uniform and normal."

These innovations lead to improved automation of the photogrammetric workflow so that point clouds are created at sub-pixel accuracy, at very dense intervals, and in near real-time, thereby eroding the unique selling proposition of lidar scanners.Two test projects compare point clouds from aerial and street-side lidar systems with those created from images. We show that the photogrammetric accuracy compares well with the lidar-method, yet the density of surface points is much higher from images, and the throughput is commensurate with a fully automated all-digital approach. Beyond this density, we identify 15 additional advantages of the photogrammetric approach."
A Two-step Displacement Correction Algorithm for Registration of Lidar Point Clouds and Aerial Images without Orientation Parameters,"Wu, Huayi; Li, Yong; Li, Jonathan; Gong, Jianya",pp. 1135-1145(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000010/art00002;jsessionid=eoh8p8o2g39e6.x-ic-live-02,"This paper presents a novel linear registration algorithm for lidar point clouds and aerial images without orientation parameters. First, preprocessing is conducted to classify the lidar point clouds into ground points, building points, and aboveground, non-building points. After preprocessing, the algorithm consists of two sequential steps, i.e., Tilt Displacement Correction and Height Displacement Correction. As the kernel of the proposed registration algorithm, the mathematical model for Height Displacement Correction is a set of linear formulas analytically deduced from the rigorous geometric function of a single image. The proposed registration algorithm does not require any orientation parameters for the image, which greatly lowers the requirements for image acquisition. Due to the model’s linearity, the proposed algorithm is computationally efficient. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can register aerial images without orientation parameters at the same accuracy level of space resection based on collinear equations. This result fulfills the requirement for the fusion of lidar range data and aerial images in most large-scale urban modeling applications."
Functional Linear Analysis of in situ Hyperspectral Data for Assessing CDOM in Rivers,"Yu, Qian; Tian, Yong Q.; Chen, Robert F.; Liu, Anna; Gardner, G.

To reduce the uncertainty, we developed a functional linear model (FLM) to analyze spectral responses to CDOM concentrations observed in a cruise along two rivers and a tidal bay. The analysis was supported with the measurement of high spatial resolution underwater CDOM concentrations and concurrent in situ above-surface hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance. The functional linear model is able to explain up to 91percent of CDOM observations (R2= 0.91, RMSE = 0.0206). The dummy variables of local environmental factors included in the estimation improve CDOM assessment in coastal water. Our analysis suggests that the pattern changes of the FLM coefficient curves provide useful information for understanding the spectral signal interference from turbidity and chlorophyll. This work presents a feasibility study of in situ remote sensing of CDOM on a shipboard platform."
Land Cover Classification in a Complex Urban-Rural Landscape with QuickBird Imagery,"Lu, Dengsheng; Hetrick, Scott; Moran, Emilio",pp. 1159-1168(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000010/art00004;jsessionid=eoh8p8o2g39e6.x-ic-live-02,"High spatial resolution images have been increasingly used for urban land-use/land-cover classification, but the high spectral variation within the same land-cover, the spectral confusion among different land-covers, and the shadow problem often lead to poor classification performance based on the traditional per-pixel spectral-based classification methods. This paper explores approaches to improve urban land-cover classification with QuickBird imagery. Traditional per-pixel spectral-based supervised classification, incorporation of textural images and multispectral images, spectral-spatial classifier, and segmentation-based classification are examined in a relatively new developing urban landscape, Lucas do Rio Verde in Mato Grosso State, Brazil. This research shows that use of spatial information during the image classification procedure, either through the integrated use of textural and spectral images or through the use of segmentation-based classification method, can significantly improve land-cover classification performance."
Active Contour and Hill Climbing for Tree Crown Detection and Delineation,"Ke, Yinghai; Zhang, Wenhua; Quackenbush, Lindi J.",pp. 1169-1181(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000010/art00005;jsessionid=eoh8p8o2g39e6.x-ic-live-02,"This paper presents a new approach for individual tree crown detection and delineation that is applicable under various imaging conditions. The approach extracts crown area using a region-based active contour model and then detects tree tops within the crown area by considering both spectral and shape characteristics of the crown. The detected tree tops allow subsequent clustering of crown pixels using a new hill-climbing algorithm. We tested the approach on a Norway spruce stand using three types of high spatial resolution imagery: an Emerge natural color vertical aerial image, an off-nadir QuickBird panchromatic image, and a natural color digital orthoimage. In comparison to the published region growing algorithm, our approach improved tree crown detection by over 10 percent for all three types of imagery, and provided accurate tree crown diameter estimation, which has utility in tree volume estimation, species composition, and forest health analysis."
Registration of Terrestrial Photogrammetric Data Using Natural Surfaces as Control,"Levin, Shahaf; Filin, Sagi",pp. 1183-1193(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000010/art00006;jsessionid=eoh8p8o2g39e6.x-ic-live-02,"We present a model for the alignment of image sets using topographic data as control information. Traditional photogrammetric practices are point-based and require wellmeasured and clearly marked entities within the scene; for repeated measurement, their demarcation should also be durable. Nonetheless, placement of photogrammetric control points oftentimes cannot be readily implemented within the area for documentation. In many of those cases, some form of topographic model, either coarse or fine, exists or can be readily established. This topographic description provides a broad and markerless coverage of control information, which, if modeled appropriately, can substitute the use of a control-point network in the alignment process. We present in this paper a registration model for terrestrial images based on surfaces as control information. The paper addresses both the problem of acquiring mutual corresponding entities and registration based on varying resolutions. The application of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a mapping of an archeological site and for registration of a set of terrestrial images of an open, unstructured scene using airborne laser scanning data. Results show both the applicability of such a model and that estimation comparable in quality to point based observations can be achieved."
Triangulating the Past – Recovering Portugal’s Aerial Images Repository,"Redweik, Paula; Roque, Dora; Marques, António; Matildes, Rita; Marques, Fernando",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000009/art00001;jsessionid=917pntaobse2b.x-ic-live-03,"Although traditional and web map producers strive to deliver up-to-date products and old aerial photographs do not fit in their concept, other users are rather interested in old aerial images and in temporal series. In Portugal, aerial surveys for mapping purposes started by the late thirties of the twentieth century as documented by the oldest existing aerial photos collection in the archives of the IGEOE in Lisbon. Being the oldest visual witnesses of the country, the relevance of the information they contain is unquestionable. The objective of this project is the recovery of an important national aerial photographic heritage hibernating in analogue format in the archives. In a test block, strategies to recover radiometry and spatial orientation were developed and successfully tested in order to make the photos accessible and workable by the modern scientific community and by the general public. A photo-geographic database has also been organized and made available."

The main topics of the evaluation phase are the analysis of geometric accuracy and sensor calibration, the radiometric performance including on-site radiometric calibration and multi-spectral land classifications, the performance of photogrammetric Digital Surface Model (DSM) generation, and the potential of manual stereoplotting from digital images. Within this paper, only results obtained at the Institute of Photogrammetry (IFP), Universitaet Stuttgart will be presented, comprehensively proving the high performance of digital camera systems and processing. The IFP served as the pilot center and additionally concentrated on the investigation of camera geometry and the image based generation of height data."
New Era of Cartosat Satellites for Large Scale Mapping,"Radhadevi, P.V.; Solanki, S.S.; Nagasubramanian, V.; Mahapatra, Archana; Reddy, D.

Cartosat series of satellites with stereo mapping capability have become the mainstay towards large scale mapping for urban and rural applications. Algorithms for processing of high-resolution Indian remote sensing satellite data has been developed at ADRIN and is used for operational generation of data products. Variations in the sensor model with respect to the viewing geometries of Cartosat-1 and Cartosat-2 are explained in the paper. Finally, an assessment of the mapping potential of the satellites is discussed. The geometric accuracy achieved from Cartosat-1 and Cartosat-2 images over the same checkpoints are compared. DEM, geometric accuracy, and capability for topographic feature capture are good enough for making 1:10 000 and 1:7 000 scale maps from Cartosat-1 and Cartosat-2, respectively. Based on the error estimation and analysis, it is concluded that if the strict photogrammetric processing model and ground control points are employed, high-resolution satellite imagery can be used for the generation and update of topographic maps of scale 1:10 000 and larger."
Comparison of Matching Algorithms for DSM Generation in Urban Areas from Ikonos Imagery,"Alobeid, Abdalla; Jacobsen, Karsten; Heipke, Christian",pp. 1041-1050(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000009/art00004;jsessionid=917pntaobse2b.x-ic-live-03,"The extraction of the third dimension from remote sensing data is a well known technique. Since in a number of countries aerial images and laser scanner data are unavailable, expensive or classified, stereoscopic high-resolution optical satellite images provide a viable alternative for generating digital surface and digital terrain models. Especially the automatic extraction of highly accurate 3D surface models in urban areas is still a very complicated task due to occlusions, large differences in height and the variety of objects and surface material.In this paper an analysis and a visual and quantitative comparison of three different matching algorithms for generating urban DSMs based on very high-resolution satellite images is presented. The three algorithms are least squares matching (LSM) in a region growing fashion, dynamic programming (DP) and semiglobal matching (SGM). The characteristics of the three algorithms as applied to four different Ikonos stereo pairs with a ground sampling distance of 1 m are shown. The following results were obtained: visually, in the LSM results the shape of the buildings is considerably smoothed. While in the DP results the building shape is sharper, only little detail is visible on the building roofs, and streaking along the epipolar lines causes problems. With SGM more details can be extracted and the results visually have the best quality. Based on reference data for the different test sites, the standard deviation of the building heights determined by LSM and DP is in the range of one pixel or slightly better, while it is in the range of half a pixel for SGM."
Investigations on Surface Reflection Models for Intensity Normalization in Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) Data,"Jutzi, Boris; Gross, Hermann",pp. 1051-1060(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000009/art00005;jsessionid=917pntaobse2b.x-ic-live-03,"The analysis of laser scanner data is of great interest for gaining geospatial information. Especially for segmentation, classification, or visualization purposes, the intensity measured with a laser scanner device can be helpful. For automatic intensity normalization, various aspects are of concern, like beam divergence and atmospheric attenuation, both depending on the range. Additionally, the intensity is influenced by the incidence angle between beam propagation direction and surface orientation. To gain the surface orientation, the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix for object points within a nearby environment are determined. After normalization the intensity does no longer depend on the incidence angle and is influenced by the material of the surface only. For surface reflection modeling, (a) the Lambertian, (b) the extended Lambertian, and (c) the Phong reflection model are introduced, to consider diffuse and specular backscattering characteristics of the surface. An airborne measurement campaign was carried out to investigate the influences of the incidence angle on the measured intensity. For investigations, 17 urban areas, such as traffic, building, and vegetation regions were studied and the derived improvements are depicted. The investigation shows that large intensity variation caused by the object surface orientation and the distance between sensor and object can be normalized by utilizing the standard Lambertian reflection model"

It then discusses the most important PSI products and their performances, analyzing their spatial sampling, the so-called residual topographic error and PSI geocoding, the average displacement rates, and the deformation time series. As C-band products are concerned, the paper reports some relevant PSI validation results, which come from the ESAfunded Terrafirma Validation Project. Regarding the X-band, it describes the results obtained over the City of Barcelona by processing 13 TerraSAR-X images. The last part discusses the main limits of PSI."

In a case study, this paper presents results of a precision and geometrical accuracy investigation of extracted double-bounce lines in SAR images. Two TerraSAR-X (TSX) acquisitions of a complex urban scene are compared to simulated SAR images. Using a new line detection method, double-bounce lines are extracted from simulated and real imagery with sub-pixel accuracy. The deviation of an extracted double-bounce line polygon with regard to both an interpolated line and ground truth is analyzed and discussed. First, it is shown that Gaussian functions model the deviation of the interpolated line from the polygon sufficiently well. Second, the absolute geometrical accuracy of the extracted double-bounce lines is evaluated with respect to ground truth. Results of the case study confirm that double-bounce lines provide reliable geometrical information, for instance, for building extraction and SAR image classification."

In the last decades they were successfully applied to many different regression and classification problems. Their characteristics and convergence properties are well studied and relatively well understood, but they were originally designed to work with real-valued data. The main focus of this paper is the classification of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (POLSAR) data which are a complexvalued signal. Instead of using an arbitrarily projection of this complex-valued data to the real domain, the paper proposes the usage of complex-valued MLPs (CV-MLPs), which are an extension of MLPs to the complex domain. The paper provides a detailed yet general derivation of the complex backpropagation algorithm and mentions related problems as well as possible solutions. Furthermore, it evaluates the performance of CV-MLPs in a land-cover classification task in POLSAR images under several learning conditions, and compares the proposed classifier with standard methods. The experimental results show that CV-MLPs are successfully applicable to classification tasks in POLSAR data. They show good convergence properties and a better performance if compared to real-valued MLPs."

Two approaches to aggregating census enumeration areas (EAs) based on image-derived measures of vegetation objects were tested: (a) merging adjacent EAs according to vegetation measures, and (b) image segmentation. Both approaches exploit readily available functions within commercial GEOBIA software. Image-derived neighborhood maps were compared to a reference map derived by spatial clustering of slum index values (from census data), to provide a relative assessment of potential map utility. A size-constrained iterative segmentation approach to aggregation was more successful than standard image segmentation or feature merge techniques. The segmentation approaches account for size and shape characteristics, enabling more realistic neighborhood boundaries to be delineated. The percentage of vegetation patches within each EA yielded more realistic delineation of potential neighborhoods than mean vegetation patch size per EA."

The GLAS-derived and field-derived canopy heights portrayed good correlation (R2= 0.8354).This study also examined two representative fire fuel models within forests in East-Central Mississippi. GLAS waveforms were compared with field data for fire fuel models 9 and 10 of the fire fuel models described by Anderson (1982).

A pair of QuickBird stereo images covering downtown Shanghai were used for analysis. Multi-source data including GPS survey data, aerial images, and lidar data collected in the same area were used for Ground Control Points (GCPs) and Independent Check Points (ICPs) measurements and accuracy analysis. The vendor-provided Rational Function Model followed by a translation and scale correction model in image space was used to introduce the ground control and improve geo-positioning accuracy. The experimental results revealed that there is a clear dependency of geo-positioning accuracy on elevation where the GCPs are placed. Using the vendor-provided RFM and several GCPs across all the elevation ranges improves the overall geo-positioning accuracy."

Absolute accuracy is both predicted using error propagation and measured using reference points. Shear, a form of relative accuracy, is also assessed between each overlapping stereo pair of images. Accuracy is assessed for two different processing approaches: extraction from individual stereo pairs, and extraction from stereo pairs following the fusion of information across all overlapping stereo pairs. The latter approach was implemented with Metric Information Network (MIN) processing, an efficient process with results equivalent to a simultaneous block adjustment. Both approaches used no ground control, although in a separate sub-experiment, MIN processing was supplemented with a sparse set of ground control (GPS surveyed) points."

While the machine learning community has been enthusiastic in developing various training algorithms, little research has been conducted to evaluate the performance of these algorithms in image classification by neural networks. We introduce and evaluate nine commonly-used training algorithms in terms of their performance in land-cover classification from remotely sensed data by the multi-layer-perceptron (MLP) neural networks. MLP has been considered as the most popular neural network architecture. The training algorithms we consider are Steepest Gradient Descent, Gradient Descent with Momentum, Resilient Propagation, Fletcher-Reeves, Polak-Ribiere, Powell-Beale, Scaled Conjugate Gradient, BFGS (Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb, and Shanno), and Levenberg- Marquardt. We use each algorithm to train the MLP networks multiple times using identical training samples, and then apply each of the resultant network models to derive landcover information from a Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image. The training algorithms are further evaluated according to their training efficiency, capability of convergence, classification accuracy, and stability of the classification accuracy. It is found that the performance of these algorithms varies substantially and selecting an appropriate algorithm can lead to a fast and efficient training and an increase in land-cover classification accuracy by artificial neural networks."

Here, for the purposes of hydrocarbon analog modeling, the outcrop was required to be accurately surveyed, so that key stratigraphic surfaces could be mapped in three dimensions. Because the outcrop strata were vertically orientated, these surfaces could be tracked over a wide area; however, to provide a true reconstruction of the geology, it was necessary to also model localized vertical cliffs providing a cross-section through the stratigraphy. Terrestrial lidar was utilized to cover these cliff sections which were poorly represented in the 2.5D aerial data. The integrated outcrop surface was textured with metric aerial and terrestrial imagery providing a photorealistic model that could be used for interpretation by geologists. This formed the basis for building a geocellular model of the geological volume, which was used to assist in the understanding of subsurface reservoirs where data are often limited."
Linearization of NDVI Based on its Relationship with Vegetation Fraction,"Jiang, Zhangyan; Huete, Alfredo R.",pp. 965-975(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000008/art00007;jsessionid=3n99a1dgb7t8t.x-ic-live-01,"The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is widely used for global monitoring of land surface vegetation dynamics from space. However, it is well documented that the NDVI approaches saturation asymptotically over highly vegetated areas. In this study, a linearized NDVI (LNDVI) is derived by introducing a linearity-adjustment factor, b, into the NDVI equation to improve the linearity of the relationship with vegetation fraction and mitigate the saturation problem encountered by NDVI. The linearity of the LNDVI is demonstrated using a ground-observed data set and a modelsimulated data set. A functional relationship and consistence of LNDVI with other NDVI adaptations are found, providing independent justification of the value of the NDVI adaptations. Due to its improved linearity with vegetation fraction, this index would provide more accurate monitoring of vegetation dynamics and estimation of biophysical parameters. The LNDVI can be derived from historical NDVI datasets directly without knowledge of input reflectances."

The median percentage of error in the best and worst models was 25 percent and 50 percent, respectively. Neural network models generally provided better predictions than multiple regression models. The factors most highly related to population density included spectral variance in reflectance; contrast between urban vegetation and dark material (e.g., asphalt); contrast between vegetation and bare soil; total albedo, and thermal temperature."
Climate and Land-Use Effects on Interannual fAPAR Variability from MODIS 250 m Data,"Linderman, Marc; Zeng, Yu; Rowhani, Pedram",pp. 807-816(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000007/art00002;jsessionid=33suhafq89e45.x-ic-live-02,"The goals of this research were to examine the effects of climate, land-use, and plot-level characteristics on interan-nual change of vegetation characteristics. Using mixed-effects regression models, we examined the influences of climatic limiting factors and plot-level characteristics on annual fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fAPAR) estimates from MODIS 250 m resolution data across agricultural and restored prairie plots in Iowa. Prairie plots had significantly higher annual fAPAR and less year-to-year variability than highly intensive agriculture. Comparisons between fixed and random effects models show that differential climate responses between land-use types explain approximately 85 percent of between pixel differences. Year-to-year climate differences and pixel scale land-use factors explained approximately 48 percent of agriculture within-plot trends and interannual variability and 54 percent of prairie year-to-year variance. Agriculture responses were predominantly influenced by precipitation and prairies were primarily influenced by incident radiation and age since restoration."
A Volumetric Approach to Change Detection in Satellite Images,"Pollard, Thomas B.; Eden, Ibrahim; Mundy, Joseph L.; Cooper, David B.",pp. 817-831(15),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000007/art00003;jsessionid=33suhafq89e45.x-ic-live-02,"The increasing availability of very high resolution satellite imagery has spurred interest in automatically detecting very fine detailed changes in an area over time, a particularly useful tool for analyzing activity in dense urban areas. However, attempting automated change detection at this resolution is difficult due to the motion parallax of elevated structures. This paper presents a comprehensive solution to change detection in areas of significant 3D relief using a new framework called volumetric appearance modeling (VAM). This approach can manage the complications of unknown and changing world surfaces by maintaining a 3D voxel-based model, where probability distributions for surface occupancy and image appearance are stored in each voxel. These distributions are continuously updated as new images are received using an adaptive learning procedure. This representation is demonstrated to produce accurate change detection results under conditions of variable illumination and viewpoint as well as haze conditions present in satellite imagery. The volumetric representation also supports automatic sensor model correction to align incoming imagery to a common geographic reference. This registration approach is demonstrated to achieve geo-positioning accuracy on the order of the ground sampling distance (GSD) or better."

Three MLAS included random forest (RF), classification and regression tree (CART), and maximum likelihood classification (MLC). Comparisons were based on several criteria: overall accuracy, sensitivity to data set size, and noise. Our results indicated that first, the random forest and CART approach can achieve substantial improvements in accuracy over the traditional MLC method. Random forest produced the highest overall accuracy (91.3 percent) the kappa coefficient 0.8943, with marsh class accuracies ranging from 77.4 percent to 90.0 percent. Secondly, the random forest method was least sensitive to reduction in training sample size, and it was most resistant to the presence of noise compared to CART and MLC. The comparison between three MLAS revealed that the random forest approach was most resistant to training data deficiencies while improved land-cover map accuracy in marsh area."
An Innovative Image Space Clustering Technique for Automatic Road Network Vectorization,"Mokhtarzade, M.; Valadan Zoej, M.J.; Ebadi, H.; Sahebi, M.R.",pp. 841-852(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000007/art00005;jsessionid=33suhafq89e45.x-ic-live-02,"Road vectorization aims to delineate road centerlines from aerial and satellite images. In this paper, binary road image space clustering techniques, which are used to determine key points on the road, are expanded to a more accurate and reliable algorithm, the Increasing Ellipse Clustering technique. Accurate noise cluster recognition and omission are two strengths of the proposed algorithm. In order to establish the true connections between predetermined key points on the road, a very fast, novel, and reliable fuzzy ellipse-shaped clustering methodology is introduced. Different accuracy assessment parameters are established and evaluated based on results obtained for simulated and real road binary images. The sub-pixel geometric accuracy of the extracted road network, with a completeness of more than 80 percent, demonstrates the promising results of the vectorization algorithm that is presented in this paper."
Evaluation of the Influence of Local Fuel Homogeneity on Fire Hazard through Landsat-5 TM Texture Measures,"Vega-García, Cristina; Tatay-Nieto, Jaime; Blanco, Ricardo; Chuvieco, Emilio",pp. 853-864(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000007/art00006;jsessionid=33suhafq89e45.x-ic-live-02,"This study analyzed the relationship between landscape homogeneity and fire hazard for a certain area and time period (1984 to 1995), by using logit models. Homogeneity was measured though eight texture measurements computed on visible and NIR bands of Landstat-5 TM data with varying kernel sizes. Several significant models could be developed to predict future burning at the pixel level for the study period. The best spectral band for detecting proneness to burn was TM1, the blue band, and best results were achieved with large window sizes and the Homogeneity texture measure."
"Acquisition, Orthorectification, and Object-based Classification of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Imagery for Rangeland Monitoring","Laliberte, Andrea S.; Herrick, Jeffrey E.; Rango, Albert; Winters, Craig",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000006/art00001;jsessionid=3sptam0fup7ep.x-ic-live-03,"The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for natural resource applications has increased considerably in recent years due to their greater availability, the miniaturization of sensors, and the ability to deploy a UAV relatively quickly and repeatedly at low altitudes. We examine in this paper the potential of using a small UAV for rangeland inventory, assessment and monitoring. Imagery with a ground resolved distance of 8 cm was acquired over a 290 ha site in southwestern Idaho. We developed a semi-automated orthorectification procedure suitable for handling large numbers of small-footprint UAV images. The geometric accuracy of the orthorectified image mosaics ranged from 1.5 m to 2 m. We used object-based hierarchical image analysis to classify imagery of plots measured concurrently on the ground using standard rangeland monitoring procedures. Correlations between image-and ground-based estimates of percent cover resulted in r-squared values ranging from 0.86 to 0.98. Time estimates indicated a greater efficiency for the image-based method compared to ground measurements. The overall classification accuracies for the two image mosaics were 83 percent and 88 percent. Even under the current limitations of operating a UAV in the National Airspace, the results of this study show that UAVs can be used successfully to obtain imagery for rangeland monitoring, and that the remote sensing approach can either complement or replace some ground-based measurements. We discuss details of the UAV mission, image processing and analysis, and accuracy assessment."
A Pixel Based Regeneration Index using Time Series Similarity and Spatial Context,"Lhermitte, Stefaan; Verbesselt, Jan; Verstraeten, Willem W.; Coppin, Pol",pp. 673-682(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000006/art00002;jsessionid=3sptam0fup7ep.x-ic-live-03,"Although the regeneration index based on control plots provides a valuable tool to quantify fire impact and subsequent vegetation regrowth, the practical implementation at large scale levels remains limited due to the need for detailed reference maps. The objective of this research therefore was the development of an image-based selection approach for control pixels based on time series similarity (TSS). The TSS approach allows the computation of a per-pixel regeneration index on regional to global scale without the need for reference maps. Evaluation of the control plot selection approaches based on un-burnt focal pixels confirmed the validity of the TSS approach and showed optimal results for the TSSRMSDapproach with x= 4and NT= 8 due to beneficial averaging effects and minimal window size effects. As such, the effects of spatial heterogeneity and noise are minimized and a preliminary quality indicator can be derived."
A Novel Approach to Terrestrial Lidar Georeferencing,"Wilkinson, Benjamin E.; Mohamed, Ahmed H.; Dewitt, Bon A.; Seedahmed, Gamal H.",pp. 683-690(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000006/art00003;jsessionid=3sptam0fup7ep.x-ic-live-03,This paper describes a novel method for determining the absolute orientation of lidar point clouds using GPS measurements from two antennas firmly mounted on the optical head of a lidar scanner. The solution is linear and is derived from the non-linear georeferencing model by exploiting the properties of the skew-symmetric matrix. Simulation and real world experimentation using our prototype suggest a precision of about 0.05° ( 1 mrad) for the three Euler attitude angles. The method can help alleviate problems associated with the conventional technique and can allow for an increased number of practical applications for georeferenced terrestrial lidar.

Classification accuracy assessment was calculated using an error matrix for all images. Gram-Schmidt and Principal Components spectral sharpening techniques had an overall accuracy of 90.5 percent and 89.5 percent and a kappa coefficient of 0.85 and 0.84, respectively, compared to the MS image which had an overall accuracy of 86.3 percent and a kappa coefficient of 0.79. Brovey transformation and HSV performed poorly in the supervised classification with overall accuracies of 64.2 percent and 76.8 percent and kappa coefficients of 0.48 and 0.65, respectively.

Effects of Topographic Variability and Lidar Sampling Density on Several DEM Interpolation Methods,"Guo, Qinghua; Li, Wenkai; Yu, Hong; Alvarez, Otto",pp. 701-712(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000006/art00005;jsessionid=3sptam0fup7ep.x-ic-live-03,"This study aims to quantify the effects of topographic variability (measured by coefficient variation of elevation, CV) and lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) sampling density on the DEM (Digital Elevation Model) accuracy derived from several interpolation methods at different spatial resolutions. Interpolation methods include natural neighbor (NN), inverse distance weighted (IDW), triangulated irregular network (TIN), spline, ordinary kriging (OK), and universal kriging (UK). This study is unique in that a comprehensive evaluation of the combined effects of three influencing factors (CV, sampling density, and spatial resolution) on lidar-derived DEM accuracy is carried out using different interpolation methods. Results indicate that simple interpolation methods, such as IDW, NN, and TIN, are more efficient at generating DEMs from lidar data, but kriging-based methods, such as OK and UK, are more reliable if accuracy is the most important consideration. Moreover, spatial resolution also plays an important role when generating DEMs from lidar data. Our results could be used to guide the choice of appropriate lidar interpolationmethods for DEM generation given the resolution, sampling density, and topographic variability."
Detecting Seasonal Changes in Crop Community Structure using Day and Night Digital Images,"Sakamoto, Toshihiro; Shibayama, Michio; Takada, Eiji; Inoue, Akihiro; Morita, Kazuhiro; Takahashi, Wataru; Miura, Shigenori; Kimura, Akihiko",pp. 713-726(14),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000006/art00006;jsessionid=3sptam0fup7ep.x-ic-live-03,"This study investigates a simple approach using day and night digital images to objectively measure seasonal changes in crop morphology. A paddy field in the Toyama prefecture and a barley field in the Ibaraki prefecture of Japan were observed by two commercially available digital cameras in simple waterproof cases which captured day and night images by shooting at regular intervals using an auto-flash mode. The newly developed NRBINIR(Nighttime Relative Brightness Index in Near Infra Red), based on the nighttime NIR images, had high correlations with plant length until heading (paddy; R2=0.996, barley; R2=0.996), and the total dry weight until 20 days after heading (paddy; R2=0.997). Investigating the temporal pattern of the three indexes (daytime NDVIGR, nighttime NDVIGR, and NRBINIR) coupled with field measurement data, we confirmed that the time-series data derived from inexpensive, specifically modified digital cameras are available for monitoring the seasonal changes in crop growth."

Much work has been done on frame camera imagery and/or push-broom scanner imagery, and it has been widely accepted that the RPC model can be taken as an alternative to rigorous sensor models for photogrammetric processing. However, there have been few publications discussing the application of the RPC model to SAR image processing. In this paper, we first review the geometric effects of SAR imagery and compare SAR imagery with optical satellite imagery. Then, the unbiased RPC estimators for a series of SAR images are derived. Based on numerous tests with the rigorous sensor model available, the modeling error of the RPC is analyzed. This study found that the RPC model is suitable for SAR imagery and can be used as a replacement for the rigorous sensor model for photogrammetric processing."

Ground-based measurements showed a 2.5°C increase in radiant temperature of CO2-affected soybeans.Aerial thermal infrared imagery showed distinct plumes of elevated radiant temperatures in the soybean field downwind of the two CO2point-release sites six to eight hours after gas was released. Field measurements of atmospheric CO2concentrations taken at three heights (ground, underside, and mid-canopy) guided by an air-to-ground imagery transmitter, support aerial imagery interpretations."

A 1999 map of rangeland vegetation communities was created using boosted classification tree analysis. The 1999 map and a 1985 image were utilized in a change vector analysis resulting in a classified map for 1985. Classification accuracies ranged from 72.30 percent to 83.65 percent for the 1999 map and 72.60 percent to 88.73 percent for the 1985 map, depending upon level of class detail, demonstrating that Landsat-class data can be effectively used for efficient change analysis that maintains accuracy while reducing compound error. Spatial patterns of change were compared to theories from other studies related to change in the NR and were found to be consistent with effects from fire suppression, precipitation, and urban growth but not with trophic cascade from wolves or beaver effects."
Analysis of Impervious Surface and its Impact on Urban Heat Environment using the Normalized Difference Impervious Surface Index (NDISI),"Xu, Hanqiu",pp. 557-565(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000005/art00002;jsessionid=1ltln7twf3p1j.x-ic-live-03,"The fast urban expansion has led to replacement of natural vegetation-dominated land surfaces by various impervious materials. This has a significant impact on the environment due to modification of heat energy balance. Timely understanding of spatiotemporal information of impervious surface has become more urgent as conventional methods for estimating impervious surface are very limited. In response to this need, this paper proposes a new index, normalized difference impervious surface index (NDISI), for estimating impervious surface. The application of the index to the Landsat ETM+ image of Fuzhou City and the ASTER image of Xiamen City in China has shown that the new index can efficiently enhance and extract impervious surfaces from satellite imagery, and the normalized NDISI can represent the real percentage of impervious surface. The index was further used as an indicator to investigate the impact of impervious surface on urban heat environment by examination of its quantitative relationship with land surface temperature (LST), vegetation, and water using multivariate statistical analysis. The result reveals that impervious surface has a positive exponential relationship with LST rather than a simple linear one. This suggests that the areas with high percent impervious surface will accelerate LST rise and urban heat island development."

This study tested several commonly applied classifiers to map teasel with an aerial hyperspectral image along the Interstate Highway 70 in central Missouri. A teasel/non-teasel mask was first built to exclude dominant land-covers that had distinct spectral differences from teasel. The spectral angle mapping (SAM) had the best results of delineating teasel from herbaceous background with its user’s and producer’s accuracies of 80 to 90 percent. Large commission errors of teasel were observed in the probability-based maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) and spectral information divergence (SID) methods. Compared with a regular land-use/land-cover classification in an unsupervised/supervised hybrid method, the post-masking SAM had much easier process of training data collection and achieved similar accuracies. It could be an optimal approach for mapping teasel and other weeds in highway environments."
Detection of Sinkhole Hazards using Airborne Laser Scanning Data,"Filin, Sagi; Baruch, Amit",pp. 577-587(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000005/art00004;jsessionid=1ltln7twf3p1j.x-ic-live-03,"Airborne laser scanning technology is primarily perceived as a means for gathering detailed three-dimensional information about the surface and objects on it. The dense 3D data contain information about surface features and geohazards, some of which are of subtle form. Geohazards are usually embedded within the terrain, and scarcely form distinct shape-transition to their surroundings; therefore their detection is challenging. We address in this paper detection of subtle terrain features and demonstrate it on collapse sinkholes. Collapse sinkholes are surface depressions whose formation has severe effect on the environment and on regional development. We present an autonomous model for their extraction and characterization. Sinkholes within the studied regions appear in various size, forms, from their embryonic to a well developed formation. The level of sinkhole detection is high, and as demonstrated, the model performs well under varying landforms and surface texture, with little influence on the correctness of the extracted sinkholes. As the results show, features of approximately 20 cm deep can be identified and separated from their surroundings in the data."

Within the formulation of variance propagation, the most important consideration is the values used to describe the error of the hardware component observations including the global positioning system, inertial measurement unit, laser ranger, and laser scanner (angular encoder noise and beam divergence). Data tested yielded in general, pessimistic predictions as 85 percent of residuals were within the predicted error level. Simulated errors for varying scan angles and altitudes produced horizontal errors largely influenced by IMU subsystem error as well as angular encoder noise and beam divergence. GPS subsystem errors contribute the largest proportion of vertical error only at shallow scan angles and low altitudes. The transformation of the domination of GPS related error sources to total vertical error occurs at scan angles of 23°, 13°, and 8° at flying heights of 1,200 m, 2,000 m, and 3,000 m AGL, respectively."

We used six KH-9 images acquired in 1980 over two testfields in Central Asia. Using reseau marks on the scanned KH-9 frames, we found and corrected image distortions. In bundle orientation with Ground Control Points (GCPs) from QuickBird images, we achieved horizontal accuracies below 6 m for a flat terrain testfield and approximately 10 m for a mountainous terrain testfield. With three GCPs the image orientation horizontal accuracy degraded by only 20 percent. We generated a DEM from the KH-9 images and estimated its vertical accuracy using IceSAT laser altimetry data and an additional DEM from 1:25 000 topographic maps. The DEM RMSE was 6.18 m over flat terrain and 20.0 m over mountainous terrain."

The boundaries of these patches are then refined through the incorporation of stereo-aerial imagery while utilizing 3D geometric and spectral constraints. Precise building boundaries are derived through resolving feature matching problems and fully utilizing spectral information. Finally, an efficient manual mono-plotting procedure is introduced to remove incorrect and add missing boundaries. The performance of the developed procedures is evaluated through experimental results from real data where the correctness, completeness, and accuracy of the derived building models are evaluated through comparison with a manually generated DBM."

When the root mean squared error of the product equals the threshold of the standard the simulation results show the ASLSM is very restrictive, classifying 75 percent of products as Class 2 maps instead of Class 1 maps. If the variability of the product is greater or lesser than this threshold, results can be depicted by a family of acceptance curves. These curves can be employed by users to determine the sample size needed to limit their acceptance risk, but also by producers to analyze their rejection risk."
A Multi-scale Approach for Delineating Individual Tree Crowns with Very High Resolution Imagery,"Wang, Le",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000004/art00001;jsessionid=2f6o8alb5cjqj.x-ic-live-03,"This paper presents a multi-scale approach for delineating individual tree crowns (ITC) from high spatial resolution imagery. By analyzing the evolution of image gradients over the scale-space constructed with orthogonal wavelets, tree crown boundaries are effectively strengthened while the textures resulted from tree branches and twigs are largely suppressed. Two scale consistency checks, a scale and a geometric consistency check, were devised to account for tree crown’s radiometric and geometric characteristic. After an edge-enhanced image was acquired, a previously developed marker-controlled watershed segmentation method was adopted to delineate ITC. An experiment was carried out in a study site in California. Field measurements of crown size of 58 trees were compared with those derived from aerial imagery. An R square value of 0.68 was achieved. It was found that crown size was underestimated from the photo interpretation compared to that from the ground survey. The result can be attributed to the fact that pixels lying on the tree crown boundaries are poorly represented in the image."

The influence of MI on the performance of template matching, calculated by different histogram bins, is analyzed first. A modified PSO method (CRI-PSO) is then presented. The proposed algorithm is tested with remote sensing imagery from different sensors and for different seasons. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is robust in practical scenarios and outperforms the standard PSO, multi-start PSO, and cross-correlation algorithms in accuracy and efficiency with our test data. The proposed method can be used for position estimation of aircraft, object recognition, and image retrieval."

Currently, sign condition changes are inspected manually in the field, which is time consuming, costly, and sometimes dangerous. This paper first proposes a novel algorithm to detect three condition changes: missing, tilted, and blocked signs, using GPS data and video log images. The algorithm consists of three steps: (a) Multi-Scale Sign Image Matching (M-SIM), (b) Image feature analysis, and (c) Sign condition change detection and classification. The algorithm was tested using images with simulated sign condition changes and actual video images taken in Fiscal Year (FY) 2003 and 2005 by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (LADOTD). The tests demonstrate the algorithm is effective to detect three types of sign condition changes. Out of 34,000 actual video log images, the algorithm detected and classified 100 percent of the missing signs, 72.7 percent of the tilted signs, and 66.7 percent of the blocked signs, for an overall 74.3 percent detection rate. These results show that the algorithm is useful for developing an intelligent roadway sign condition change detection system."

Dense distribution of scanned points on object surfaces prominently implies surface features. Particularly, plane features commonly appear in a typical lidar dataset of artificial structures. To explore implicitly contained spatial information, this study developed an automatic scheme to segment a lidar point cloud dataset into coplanar point clusters. The central mechanism of the proposed method is a split-and-merge segmentation based on an octree structure. Plane fitting serves as an engine in the mechanism that evaluates how well a group of points fits to a plane. Segmented coplanar points and derived parameters of their best-fit plane are obtained through the process. This paper also provides algorithms to derive various geometric properties of segmented coplanar points, including inherent properties of a plane, intersections of planes, and properties of point distribution on a plane. Several successful cases of handling airborne and terrestrial lidar data as well as a combination of the two are demonstrated. This method should improve the efficiency of object modelling using lidar data."

However, relatively small changes in the cliff face are reliably detected only with the more accurate terrestrial lidar, and the total eroded volume estimated with the terrestrial system was 30 percent larger than the corresponding airborne estimate. Although relatively small cliff changes are not detected, the airborne system can rapidly survey long cliff lengths and provides coverage on the cliff top and beach at the cliff base."

Problems remain with the quality of such DSMs, especially in steep terrain. This paper explores the accuracy of DSMs extracted from Cartosat-1 data acquired under high and low sun elevation angle conditions in High Himalayan terrain. The metric accuracy of the DSM was estimated by comparing it with check points obtained with a differential GPS. Additionally, we used spatial discrepancy of drainage lines to estimate errors in the DSM due to spatial auto-correlation. For valleys perpendicular to the satellite track, the DSM extracted from a low sun elevation angle data showed 45 percent higher spatial accuracy than the DSM extracted from high sun elevation angle data. The results indicate that the sun elevation angle and valley orientation affect the spatial accuracy of the DSM, though metric accuracy remains comparable."
Reconstruction and Texturing of 3D Urban Terrain from Uncalibrated Monocular Images Using L1Splines,"Bulatov, Dimitri; Lavery, John E.",pp. 439-449(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000004/art00007;jsessionid=2f6o8alb5cjqj.x-ic-live-03,"We propose a five-step procedure for reconstruction and texturing of 3D urban terrain based on a novel approach for 3D surface reconstruction from optical images produced by monocular optical cameras on small, inexpensive vehicles without external referencing. The approach consists of generation of a nonparametric 2.5D L1-spline surface from a point cloud and iterative creation of parametric 3D L1-spline surfaces based on parametrizations using the previous surface. Computational results for a model house and for Gottesaue Palace in Karlsruhe, Germany are presented. The results presented here are proof of principle results that show that the L1-spline-based procedure is able to reconstruct and texture 3D urban terrain in spite of the large, abrupt changes in density of the point cloud, and that it produces results that are visually competitive with or superior to competing procedures. Future improvements (finer grids, adaptive grids and parameters, reduction of computing time) are outlined."
Land-Cover Change Detection using One-Class Support Vector Machine,"Li, Peijun; Xu, Haiqing",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000003/art00001;jsessionid=60tkmejnse8rm.x-ic-live-03,"Change detection using remote sensing has considerable potential for monitoring land-cover change. Commonly, one specific class of change is of interest in many applications. In this paper, a recently developed one-class classifier, the One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM), is proposed for the change detection of one specific class by multitemporal classification. The classifier only requires samples from the change class of interest as the training data. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated in two applications by comparing with conventional post-classification comparison methods. The results demonstrated the proposed method achieved both higher overall accuracy and higher kappa coefficient than the conventional methods, and demonstrated good potential for further application. The study also indicated that with the OCSVM, the analysis can focus only on the specific class of interest and does not need to treat other classes, thus providing highly accurate change detection. The OCSVM-based change detection method, as a general and easily implemented method, can be used for applications where only the change of one specific class is of interest."
A Study of Trajectory Models for Satellite Image Triangulation,"Jeong, In-seong; Bethel, James",pp. 265-276(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000003/art00002;jsessionid=60tkmejnse8rm.x-ic-live-03,"Many Spaceborne imagery products are provided with metadata or support data having diverse types, representations, frequencies, and conventions. According to the variability of metadata, a compatible physical sensor model approach must be constructed. Among the three components of the sensor model, i.e., trajectory model, projection equations, and parameter subset selection, the construction of the position and attitude trajectory is closely linked with the availability and type of support data. In this paper, we show how trajectory models can be implemented based on support data from six satellite image types: QuickBird, Hyperion, SPOT-3, ASTER, PRISM, and EROS-A. Triangulation for each image is implemented to investigate the feasibility and suitability of the different trajectory models. The results show the effectiveness of some of the simple models while indicating that careful use of dense ephemeris information is necessary. These results are based on having a number of high quality ground control points."
Evaluation for Damaged Degree of Vegetation by Forest Fire using Lidar and a Digital Aerial Photograph,"Kwak, Doo-Ahn; Chung, Jinwon; Lee, Woo-Kyun; Kafatos, Menas; Lee, Si Young; Cho, Hyun-Kook; Lee, Seung-Ho",pp. 277-287(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000003/art00003;jsessionid=60tkmejnse8rm.x-ic-live-03,"The amount of vegetation physically damaged by forest fire can be evaluated using lidar (Light Detection And Ranging) data because the loss of canopy height and width by forest fire can be relevant to the number of points transmitted to the ground through the canopy of the damaged forest. On the other hand, the biological damage of vegetation caused by forest fire can be obtained from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which determines the vegetation vitality. In this study, the degree of physical damage from the lidar data was classified into serious physical damage (SPD) and light physical damage (LPD). The degree of biological damage using NDVI was likewise classified into serious biological damage (SBD) and light biological damage (LBD). Finally, the damaged area was graded into four categories: (a) SPD and SBD, (b) LPD and SBD, (c) SPD and LBD, and (d) LPD and LBD. The accuracy assessment for the area classified into four grades showed an overall accuracy of 0.74, and a kappa value of 0.61 which provides improvement over previous works."
Accuracy Assessment Measures for Object-based Image Segmentation Goodness,"Clinton, Nicholas; Holt, Ashley; Scarborough, James; Yan, Li; Gong, Peng",pp. 289-299(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000003/art00004;jsessionid=60tkmejnse8rm.x-ic-live-03,"To select an image segmentation from sets of segmentation results, measures for ranking the segmentations relative to a set of reference objects are needed. We review selected vector-based measures designed to compare the results of object-based image segmentation with sets of training objects extracted from the image of interest. We describe and compare area-based and location-based measures that measure the shape similarity between segments and training objects. By implementing the measures in two object-based image processing software packages, we illustrate their use in terms of automatically identifying parsimonious parameter combinations from arbitrarily large sets of segmentation results. The results show that the measures have divergent performance in terms of the identification of parameter combinations. Clustering of the results in measure space narrows the search. We illustrate combination schemes for the measures for generating rankings of segmentation results. The ranked segmentation results are illustrated and described."
A Mathematical Expression for Stereoscopic Depth Perception,"Rosas, Humberto; Vargas, Watson; Cerón, Alexander; Domínguez, Darío; Cárdenas, Adriana",pp. 301-306(6),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000003/art00005;jsessionid=60tkmejnse8rm.x-ic-live-03,"The metric nature of stereoscopic depth perception has remained an enigma. Several mathematical formulations proposed for measuring the stereoscopic effect have not shown to be reliable. This may be due to the lack of a conceptual distinction between the 3D model geometrically obtained by intersection of visual rays (geometric model), and the 3D model perceived in the observer’s mind (perceptual model). Based on the assumption that retinal parallax is the only source of information on depth available to the brain, we developed an equation that shows real and perceptual space to be connected by a logarithmic function. This relationship has allowed us to formulate the vertical exaggeration for all sorts of stereoscopic conditions, including natural stereo-vision. The obtained formulations might involve possibilities of technological applications, such as the artificial recreation of a natural stereo-vision effect, and the design of stereoscopic instruments with a desired degree of vertical exaggeration."
Co-registration of Surfaces by 3D Least Squares Matching,"Akca, Devrim",pp. 307-318(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000003/art00006;jsessionid=60tkmejnse8rm.x-ic-live-03,"A method for the automatic co-registration of 3D surfaces is presented. The method utilizes the mathematical model of Least Squares 2D image matching and extends it for solving the 3D surface matching problem. The transformation parameters of the search surfaces are estimated with respect to a template surface. The solution is achieved when the sum of the squares of the 3D spatial (Euclidean) distances between the surfaces are minimized. The parameter estimation is achieved using the Generalized Gauss-Markov model. Execution level implementation details are given. Apart from the co-registration of the point clouds generated from spaceborne, airborne and terrestrial sensors and techniques, the proposed method is also useful for change detection, 3D comparison, and quality assessment tasks. Experiments using terrain data examples show the capabilities of the method."
Point Set Topology Extraction for Branch and Crown-level Species Classification,"Niccolai, Andrew; Niccolai, Melissa; Dearing Oliver, Chadwick",pp. 319-330(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000003/art00007;jsessionid=60tkmejnse8rm.x-ic-live-03,Contextually-based distance and proximity functions derived from the axioms of point set topology are applied at the branch and crown-level for species differentiation between eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) and eastern white pine (Pinus strobus). Point set topology is a branch of mathematics that offers methods to describe the connectivity and orientation of spatial objects and therefore allows object grouping based on spatial characteristic metrics unlike traditional fixed distance measures imposed from a global metric. Local neighborhood membership functions based on topological space are robust to variation in object sizes within a fixed image resolution and are therefore useful for describing spatial characteristics in highly variable objects such as tree morphology. We investigated the utility of topological space for describing branch-level needle orientations and crown-level patterns of high and low spectral intensity clusters. Branch-level measures of orientations within topologically-derived neighborhoods resulted in a classification accuracy of 96 percent for hemlock and pine; this represents a 23 percentage point (pp) improvement over traditional spectral feature classification. A crown-level species feature extraction and classification methodology that incorporated a local Getis (Gi*) statistic contour analysis produced species discrimination results that were improved by 8 pp for an overall accuracy of 85 percent over traditional color and shape-based feature classification.
Comparison of Geo-Object Based and Pixel-Based Change Detection of Riparian Environments using High Spatial Resolution Multi-Spectral Imagery,"Johansen, Kasper; Arroyo, Lara A.; Phinn, Stuart; Witte, Christian",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000002/art00001;jsessionid=gbde8u3cju92.x-ic-live-03,"The objectives of this research were to (a) develop a geo-object-based classification system for accurately mapping riparian land-cover classes for two QuickBird images, and (b) compare change maps derived from geo-object-based and per-pixel inputs used in three change detection techniques. The change detection techniques included post-classification comparison, image differencing, and the tasseled cap transformation. Two QuickBird images, atmospherically corrected to at-surface reflectance, were captured in May and August 2007 for a savanna woodlands area along Mimosa Creek in Central Queensland, Australia. Concurrent in-situ land-cover identification and lidar data were used for calibration and validation. The geo-object-based classification results showed that the use of class-related features and membership functions could be standardized for classifying the two QuickBird images. The geo-object-based inputs provided more accurate change detection results than those derived from the pixel-based inputs, as the geo-object-based approach reduced mis-registration and shadowing effects and allowed inclusion of context relationships."
GEOBIA Vegetation Mapping in Great Smoky Mountains National Park with Spectral and Non-spectral Ancillary Information,"Kim, Minho; Madden, Marguerite; Xu, Bo",pp. 137-149(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000002/art00002;jsessionid=gbde8u3cju92.x-ic-live-03,"Vegetation mapping was performed using geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) and very high spatial resolution (VHR) imagery for two study areas in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. This study investigated how accurately GEOBIA with ancillary data emulates manual interpretation in rugged mountain areas for multi-level vegetation classes of the National Vegetation Classification System (NVCS). It was discovered that the incorporation of texture and topographic variables with spectral data from scanned color infrared aerial photographs increased the overall accuracy of GEOBIA vegetation classification by 2.8 percent and 5.0 percent Kappa. In a separate study using multispectral Ikonos imagery, the use of elevation, aspect, slope and proximity to streams produced NVCS macro-group vegetation segmentations that resembled manual interpretation and significantly improved the overall accuracy to 76.6 percent, Kappa 0.57. Ancillary information may thus aid in GEOBIA vegetation mapping for updating vegetation inventories in rugged mountain areas."
Fuzzy Image Segmentation for Urban Land-Cover Classification,"Lizarazo, Ivan; Barros, Joana",pp. 151-162(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000002/art00003;jsessionid=gbde8u3cju92.x-ic-live-03,"A main problem of hard image segmentation is that, in complex landscapes, such as urban areas, it is very hard to produce meaningful crisp image-objects. This paper proposes a fuzzy approach for image segmentation aimed to produce fuzzy image-regions expressing degrees of membership of pixels to different target classes. This approach, called Fuzzy Image-Regions Method (FIRME), is a natural way to deal with the inherent ambiguity of remotely sensed images. The FIRME approach comprises three main stages: (a) image segmentation which creates fuzzy image-regions, (b) feature analysis which measures properties of fuzzy image regions, and (c) classification which produces the intended land-cover classes. The FIRME method was evaluated in a land-cover classification experiment using high spectral resolution imagery in an urban zone in Bogota, Colombia. Results suggest that in complex environments, fuzzy image segmentation may be a suitable alternative for GEOBIA as it produces higher thematic accuracy than the hard image segmentation and other traditional classifiers."
Real World Objects in GEOBIA through the Exploitation of Existing Digital Cartography and Image Segmentation,"Smith, Geoffrey M.; Morton, R. Daniel",pp. 163-171(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000002/art00004;jsessionid=gbde8u3cju92.x-ic-live-03,"Descriptions of Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) often identify image segmentation as the initial step. This may be reasonable in some cases, but segmentation might also be considered a “black art,” due to its image dependence and the limited amount control available to users. The resulting segments reflect the spectral structure of the image rather than the physical structure of the landscape with no one-to-one relationship between real world objects and segments. Geographic analysis often begins in the context of existing mapping. In regions with high quality large scale cartography, an obvious question is why is this information not used in the GEOBIA process? It is therefore proposed that GEOBIA be redefined to use the best existing real world feature datasets as the starting point before segmentation is considered. Such an approach would increase opportunities for integration, improve map update initiatives, and widen uptake by end user communities."
Automated Image-to-Map Discrepancy Detection using Iterative Trimming,"Radoux, Julien; Defourny, Pierre",pp. 173-181(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000002/art00005;jsessionid=gbde8u3cju92.x-ic-live-03,"Keeping existing vector databases up to date is a real challenge for GIS data providers. This study directly compares a map with a more recent image in order to detect the discrepancies between them. An automatic workflow was designed to process the image based on existing information extracted from the vector database. First, geographic object-based image analysis provided automatically labeled image segments after matching the vector database to the image. Then, discrepancies were detected using a statistical iterative trimming, where outliers were excluded based on a likelihood threshold. Applied on forest map updating, the proposed workflow was able to detect about 75 percent of the forest regeneration, and 100 percent of the clear cuts with less than 10 percent of commission errors. This discrepancy detection approach assumes that discrepancy corresponds to small proportion of the map area and is very promising in diverse applications thanks to its flexibility."
A Geographic Object-based Approach in Cellular Automata Modeling,"Moreno, Niandry; Wang, Fang; Marceau, Danielle J.",pp. 183-191(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000002/art00006;jsessionid=gbde8u3cju92.x-ic-live-03,"This paper describes an optimized implementation of an object-based cellular automata (CA) model recently developed to overcome the sensitivity of standard raster CA models to cell size and neighborhood configuration. In this CA model, space is partitioned using a vector structure in which the polygons correspond to meaningful geographical entities. The model allows the geometric transformation of each object based on the influence of its respective neighbors. In addition, it incorporates the concept of dynamic neighborhood where the neighborhood relationships among objects are expressed semantically, removing any restriction of distance in the neighborhood definition. The optimized implementation described in this paper makes use of a spatial database and spatial indexes to handle several spatial operations, which considerably reduces the computation time required for the simulations. The model is simple, flexible and robust, and can be easily adapted to various geographic areas at different scales."

In this paper, we present an approach for delineating and monitoring aggregated spatial units relevant to regional planning tasks, which has been fully validated within a 3,654 km2area in the Stuttgart Region of southwestern Germany. This has been achieved by developing algorithms for semi-automated (geo-) object-based class modeling of biotope complexes, which are aggregated, functionally homogenous (but not necessarily spectrally homogenous) units. High levels of complexity in the target classes and the need for integration of auxiliary geodata as a priori knowledge meant that different methods of information extraction were required to be combined in an operational workflow, and that new validation strategies were needed for quality assessment. A total of 31,698 biotope complexes were delineated for the entire Stuttgart Region, with an average size of 11.5 ha for each complex. Approximately 86 percent of the biotope complex boundaries were shown to have been correctly delineated."
A Self-organizing Fuzzy Segmentation (SOFS) Method for Road Detection from High Resolution Satellite Images,"Mohammadzadeh, Ali; Zoej, Mohammad Javad Valadan",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000001/art00001;jsessionid=7jcgmsfdi8o00.x-ic-live-03,"This paper proposes an image segmentation algorithm based on fuzzy logic to detect road pixels in high-resolution satellite images. Other image classification and segmentation approaches require that the number of existing classes in the image scene be specified in advance. Additionally, supervised classification algorithms require sufficient samples from an image to identify the parameters of each class. The proposed method does not require specification of the number of classes. The mean and standard deviation of road pixels are automatically calculated using one up to three samples from its surface. This is an improvement on existing classification and segmentation methods. The proposed approach is tested on both simulated and real satellite images. A QuickBird color image is segmented into road and non-road zones using mean and standard deviation values calculated using the proposed method. Finally, advanced mathematical morphology algorithms are used to extract main road centerlines from the segmented image."
The Contribution of the Fruit Component to the Hyperspectral Citrus Canopy Signal,"Somers, Ben; Delalieux, Stephanie; Verstraeten, Willem W.; Eynde, Annelies Vanden; Barry, Graham H.; Coppin, Pol",pp. 37-47(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2010/00000076/00000001/art00002;jsessionid=7jcgmsfdi8o00.x-ic-live-03,"Very few attempts have been made to qualify and quantify the contribution of fruits to the hyperspectral canopy signal. The interference of fruit may influence the effectiveness of spectral indices and radiative transfer models used to monitor leaf-related biochemical and biophysical parameters. In a series of experiments, the spectral characteristics (350 to 2,500 nm range) of fruit and its contributions to the canopy signature were investigated. Leaf, fruit, and canopy spectra were collected in a “Midknight Valencia” orange orchard, evaluated, and cross-referenced against biophysical and biochemical tree characteristics in order to gain a better insight in the contribution of citrus fruits to canopy spectral reflectance. Results indicate that the presence of fruits leads to major reflectance decreases in the infrared regions (700 to 2,500 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum. This may be explained by, on the one hand a partial obstruction of the volume scattering in the canopy, and on the other hand the significant contribution of the orange fruits to the overall equivalent canopy water thickness. In the visible (VIS: 350 to 700 nm) domain, the impact of the presence of fruit is much less evident. The occurrence of medium and heavy crop loads did not affect the visible reflectance signature significantly but was indirectly evidenced by leaf chlorosis mainly due to competition for nitrogen between the canopy elements. The knowledge gained from this study will contribute to better hyperspectral vegetation index design and improved radiative transfer models for fruit bearing perennial woody crops. What is more, the direct biochemical linkages between water, nitrogen, fruit biomass, and spectral characteristics are an important precursor for the development and implementation of an air- or space-borne crop load monitoring system for citrus orchards."

This study evaluates the influence of various factors on the shape of the returned waveform and investigates the possibility of improving terrain classification by applying waveform-derived information. The factors discussed are surface roughness, slope angle, scan angle, amplitude, and footprint size. It is statistically demonstrated that roughness is the most significant factor affecting pulse width, and that, over relatively smooth surfaces, there is no significant variation in pulse width behavior resulting from different footprint sizes. Pulse width also exhibits a relatively stable behavior when amplitude, range distance, or scan angle vary substantially. The overall accuracy of classification achieved by applying pulse width information over all the different land-cover types examined in this study (including scrub, hillside, single trees, and forest areas) was greater than 85 percent, with 94 percent achieved for open vegetation areas. Physical surface information provided by small footprint waveform data is considered to be at the microscale, therefore it is recommended to combine such information with geometry (e.g., filtering algorithms) for the optimal identification of terrain points."

An ecoregion-stratified approach was developed using a two-step processing approach that included an initial differentiation of cropland versus non-cropland and subsequent identification of individual crop types. Major crop types were mapped for the calendar years of 2002 and 2007. National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) census data were used to assess county level accuracies on a unit area basis (2002), and the NASS Crop Data Layer (CDL) was used to generate 231,616 reference data points to support a pixel-wise assessment of the MODIS crop type classification (2007) accuracy across the US portion of the GLB. County level comparisons for 2002 indicated 2.2, 6.8, 6.0, and 5.8 percent of area bias errors for corn, soybeans, wheat, and hay, respectively. Detailed pixel-wise accuracy assessments resulted in an overall crop type classification accuracy of 84 percent (Kappa 0.73) for 2007. Kappa coefficients ranged from 0.74 to 0.69 for individual ecoregions. The user’s accuracies for corn, soybean, wheat, and hay were 87, 82, 81, and 70 percent, respectively. There were spatial variations of classification performances across ecoregions, especially for soybean and hay. Field sizes had a direct impact on the variable classification performances across the GLB."

The relationship between bi-directional reflectance measurements and SOC was investigated with respect to C.I.E. color coordinates. Empirical relationships were generated for the spectral detection of SOC of two semi-arid to arid study sites. These regression models allowed the prediction of SOC with a cross-validated r20.910 (RMSEcv2.825) and r2of 0.795 (RMSEcv2.113), respectively. Because C.I.E. color coordinates were found to be appropriate parameters for predicting the SOC, reflectance values of Landsat TM bands were transformed into C.I.E. color coordinates. The C.I.E. based regression models were applied to a Landsat image to estimate SOC in the spatial domain. Concentrations predicted from satellite data corresponded well with concentration ranges derived from chemical analysis. Estimated concentrations reflect the geographic conditions and depend on annual rainfall, with a general trend to decreasing SOC with increasing aridity."
Influence of Resolution in Irrigated Area Mapping and Area Estimation,"Velpuri, N.M.; Thenkabail, P.S.; Gumma, M.K.; Biradar, C.; Dheeravath, V.; Noojipady, P.; Yuanjie, L.",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000012/art00001;jsessionid=2fbtuuc9k3ir4.x-ic-live-03,"The overarching goal of this paper was to determine how irrigated areas change with resolution (or scale) of imagery. Specific objectives investigated were to (a) map irrigated areas using four distinct spatial resolutions (or scales), (b) determine how irrigated areas change with resolutions, and (c) establish the causes of differences in resolution-based irrigated areas. The study was conducted in the very large Krishna River basin (India), which has a high degree of formal contiguous, and informal fragmented irrigated areas. The irrigated areas were mapped using satellite sensor data at four distinct resolutions: (a) NOAA AVHRR Pathfinder 10,000 m, (b) Terra MODIS 500 m, (c) Terra MODIS 250 m, and (d) Landsat ETM+ 30 m. The proportion of irrigated areas relative to Landsat 30 m derived irrigated areas (9.36 million hectares for the Krishna basin) were (a) 95 percent using MODIS 250 m, (b) 93 percent using MODIS 500 m, and (c) 86 percent using AVHRR 10,000 m. In this study, it was found that the precise location of the irrigated areas were better established using finer spatial resolution data. A strong relationship (R2= 0.74 to 0.95) was observed between irrigated areas determined using various resolutions. This study proved the hypotheses that “the finer the spatial resolution of the sensor used, greater was the irrigated area derived,” since at finer spatial resolutions, fragmented areas are detected better. Accuracies and errors were established consistently for three classes (surface water irrigated, ground water/conjunctive use irrigated, and non-irrigated) across the four resolutions mentioned above. The results showed that the Landsat data provided significantly higher overall accuracies (84 percent) when compared to MODIS 500 m (77 percent), MODIS 250 m (79 percent), and AVHRR 10,000 m (63 percent)."

Since olive farming has a great importance to the Turkish economy, an olive registration database supported by GIS and compatible with the Integrated Administrative Control System (IACS) is needed for adaptation to the European Commission Common Agricultural Policy. In this study, cadastral maps and satellite images were used to count olive trees using the OLICOUNT software developed by the Joint Research Center of the European Commission in order to develop an olive tree database. According to the analysis of the counting results for the test sites with 2,291 trees, overall omission error was 11.1 percent and commission error was 2.94 percent. These results indicate that the determination of olive trees by OLICOUNT within the area of interest has 90.37 percent accuracy that makes the method reasonably reliable."
An Object-space Simulation Method for Low-cost Digital Camera Stability Testing,"Lichti, Derek D.; Habib, Ayman; Detchev, Ivan",pp. 1407-1414(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000012/art00003;jsessionid=2fbtuuc9k3ir4.x-ic-live-03,"The widespread availability and low cost of digital cameras has been the impetus for their increased use for photogram-metric applications. The metric suitability of these cameras is critically dependent upon the stability of their interior orientation parameters (IOPs), which can be evaluated by simulation methods. Focused on aerial photogrammetry, this paper presents a new method that assesses the impact of camera stability in terms of the accuracy of object space terrain reconstruction from a large number of simulations. The results of this method are compared with those from two simulation procedures based on single-photo resection for ten sets of IOPs from three different low-cost digital cameras and are found to be in close agreement in terms of the decision about camera stability. Detailed analyses show the method is relatively insensitive to the distribution of ground control points used for camera orientation and the realism of the randomly-generated terrain, but is highly sensitive to the range of simulated terrain heights and image point measurement precision."
A New Approach for Pass-point Generation from Aerial Video Imagery,"Wilkinson, Benjamin E.; Dewitt, Bon A.; Watts, Adam C.; Mohamed, Ahmed H.; Burgess, Matthew A.",pp. 1415-1423(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000012/art00004;jsessionid=2fbtuuc9k3ir4.x-ic-live-03,"This paper presents a novel approach for automatically finding conjugate points between video images collected by a small autonomous unmanned aircraft. Our approach introduces the idea of saving the resampled patch from successive least-squares matching epochs and using them as templates for subsequent images. Tests show that this method is superior to using the first image as a template for all subsequent matching attempts. We show how the algorithm performs in terms of retention of points on successive images, distribution of points on the images, and utility when used for bundle adjustments in comparison with the conventional method of using the first image as a template. Our proposed method is able to match points on an average of 2.7 times as many images before failure compared with using the conventional method. This leads to stronger geometrical configuration, higher redundancy, and ultimately, significantly better bundle adjustment solutions."
A Simplified Analytical Model for a-priori Lidar Point-positioning Error Estimation and a Review of Lidar Error Sources,"Triglav-Čekada, Mihaela; Crosilla, Fabio; Kosmatin-Fras, Mojca",pp. 1425-1439(15),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000012/art00005;jsessionid=2fbtuuc9k3ir4.x-ic-live-03,"Although various rigorous lidar error models already exist and examples of a-posteriori studies of lidar data accuracies verified with field-work can be found in the literature, a simple measure to define a-priori error sizes is not available. In this paper, the lidar error contributions are described in detail: the basic systematic error sources, the flight-mission-related error sources, and the target-characteristic-related error sources. A review of the different error-source sizes is drawn from the literature in order to define the boundary conditions for each error size. Schenk’s geolocation equation is used as a basis for deriving a simplified error model. This model enables a quick calculation and gives a-priori plausible values for the average and maximum error size, independent of the scan and heading angles as well as being independent of any specific lidar system’s characteristics. Additionally, some notes are provided for assistance when ordering lidar data, to enable easier a-posteriori quality control."
Thematic Accuracy Consequences in Cadastre Land-cover Enrichment from a Pixel and from a Polygon Perspective,"Serra, P.; Moré, G.; Pons, X.",pp. 1441-1449(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000012/art00006;jsessionid=2fbtuuc9k3ir4.x-ic-live-03,"In this paper, cadastre agricultural cartography was enriched using crop raster maps obtained from remote sensing images. The work demonstrates the implications of applying two new terms: fidelity and purity. Per-pixel classifications and polygon enrichments were compared taking into account: (a) the consequences of using a more or less conservative strategy at the classification stage, using fidelity, and (b) the consequences of using modal thresholds at the enrichment stage when deciding which category each polygon is to be assigned to, using purity. More than 300,000 pixels and 2,800 polygons were used to measure the thematic accuracy of ten agricultural categories by means of confusion matrices. These were computed at pixel, polygon, and area level. Thematic accuracy was calculated in the classical way and without taking into account unclassified pixels as errors, as well as by paying special attention to the consequences for the classified area. The results show that polygon enrichment is a useful methodology, achieving thematic accuracies of 95.6 percent, when optimum parameters are used, while classifying 87.4 percent of the area."
A Two Stage Method to Estimate Species-specific Growing Stock,"Packalén, Petteri; Suvanto, Aki; Maltamo, Matti",pp. 1451-1460(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000012/art00007;jsessionid=2fbtuuc9k3ir4.x-ic-live-03,"Information about tree species-specific forest characteristics is often a compulsory requirement of the forest inventory system. In Finland, the use of a combination of ALS data and orthorectified aerial photographs has been studied previously, but there are some weaknesses in this approach. First, aerial photographs need radiometric correction, and second, the ALS points and aerial photographs are not properly fused due to the radial displacement. In this study, ALS points are linked to unrectified aerial photographs of known orientation parameters, which enables better fusion. Each ALS point is mapped to several aerial photographs, and the average of DN values is utilized; this averaging is considered to be a good substitute for radiometric correction. The new two-stage method is compared to the approach in which only ALS data is used. The results show the benefits of using aerial photographs together with ALS data in order to estimate tree species-specific characteristics. Compared to earlier studies, the new two-stage method shows a considerable improvement in applicability in operational use."
Assessment of 2001 NLCD Percent Tree and Impervious Cover Estimates,"Greenfield, Eric J.; Nowak, David J.; Walton, Jeffrey T.",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000011/art00001;jsessionid=2aq5ol0nkw1xi.x-ic-live-03,"The 2001 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) tree and impervious cover maps provide an opportunity to extract basic land-cover information helpful for natural resource assessments. To determine the potential utility and limitations of the 2001 NLCD data, this exploratory study compared 2001 NLCD-derived values of overall percent tree and impervious cover within geopolitical boundaries with aerial photo interpretation-derived values for the same areas. Results of the comparison reveal that NLCD underestimates tree cover and to a lesser extent, underestimates impervious cover. The underestimate appears to be consistent across the conterminous United States with no statistical differences among regions. However, there were statistical differences in the degree of underestimation of tree cover among mapping zones and of impervious cover by population density class."

Due to the numerous complexities in selecting imagery for the GLS2005, NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) sponsored the development of an automated scene selection tool, the Large Area Scene Selection Interface (LASSI), to aid in the selection of imagery for this data set. This innovative approach to scene selection applied a user-defined weighting system to various scene parameters: image cloud cover, image vegetation greenness, choice of sensor, and the ability of the Landsat-7 Scan Line Corrector (SLC)-off pair to completely fill image gaps, among others. The parameters considered in scene selection were weighted according to their relative importance to the data set, along with the algorithm’s sensitivity to that weight. This paper describes the methodology and analysis that established the parameter weighting strategy, as well as the post-screening processes used in selecting the optimal data set for GLS2005."
Adaptive Registration of Remote Sensing Images using Supervised Learning,"Eikvil, Line; Holden, Marit; Huseby, Ragnar Bang",pp. 1297-1306(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000011/art00003;jsessionid=2aq5ol0nkw1xi.x-ic-live-03,"This paper describes a system for co-registration of time series satellite images which uses a learning-based strategy. During a training phase, the system learns to recognize regions in an image suited for registration. It also learns the relationship between image characteristics and registration performance for a set of different registration algorithms. This enables intelligent selection of an appropriate registration algorithm for each region in the image, while regions unsuited for registration can be discarded. The approach is intended for co-registration of sequences of images acquired from identical or similar earth observation sensors. It has been tested for such sequences from different types of sensors, both optical and radar, with varying resolution. For images with moderate differences in content, the registration accuracy is, in general, good with an RMS error of one pixel or less."
Analysis of Dynamic Thresholds for the Normalized Difference Water Index,"Ji, Lei; Zhang, Li; Wylie, Bruce",pp. 1307-1317(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000011/art00004;jsessionid=2aq5ol0nkw1xi.x-ic-live-03,"The normalized difference water index (NDWI) has been successfully used to delineate surface water features. However, two major problems have been often encountered: (a) NDWIs calculated from different band combinations [visible, near-infrared, or shortwave-infrared (SWIR)] can generate different results, and (b) NDWI thresholds vary depending on the proportions of subpixel water/non-water components. We need to evaluate all the NDWIs for determining the best performing index and to establish appropriate thresholds for clearly identifying water features. We used the spectral data obtained from a spectral library to simulate the satellite sensors Landsat ETM+, SPOT-5, ASTER, and MODIS, and calculated the simulated NDWI in different forms. We found that the NDWI calculated from (green – SWIR)/(green + SWIR), where SWIR is the shorter wavelength region (1.2 to 1.8 mm), has the most stable threshold. We recommend this NDWI be employed for mapping water, but adjustment of the threshold based on actual situations is necessary."
A Matching Algorithm for Detecting Land Use Changes Using Case-Based Reasoning,"Li, Xia; Yeh, Anthony Gar-On; Qian, Jun-ping; Ai, Bin; Qi, Zhixin",pp. 1319-1332(14),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000011/art00005;jsessionid=2aq5ol0nkw1xi.x-ic-live-03,"The paper deals with change detection using time series SAR images. SAR provides a unique opportunity for detecting land-use changes within short intervals (e.g., monthly) in tropical and sub-tropical regions with cloud cover. Traditional change detection methods mainly rely on per-pixel spectral information but ignore per-object structural information. In this study, a new method is presented that integrates object-oriented analysis with case-based reasoning (CBR) for change detection. Object-oriented analysis is carried out to retrieve a variety of features, such as tone, shape, texture, area, and context. An incremental segmentation technique is proposed for deriving change objects from multi-temporal Radarsat images. Feature selection based on genetic algorithms is carried out to determine the optimal set of features for change detection. A CBR matching algorithm is developed to identify the temporal positions and the kind of changes. It is based on the weighted k-Nearest Neighbor classification using an accumulative similarity measure. The comparison of the four combinations of change detection methods, object-based or pixel-based plus case-based or rule-based, is carried out to validate the performance of this proposed method. The analysis shows that this integrated approach has provided an efficient way of detecting land-use changes at monthly intervals by using multi-temporal SAR images."
"Small-footprint Laser Scanning Simulator for System Validation, Error Assessment, and Algorithm Development","Kukko, Antero; Hyyppä, Juha",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000010/art00001;jsessionid=bbxj54w4vfm1.x-ic-live-01,"Airborne lidar systems have come to be extensively used in photogrammetry and mapping sciences. In this paper, a high-quality simulation approach and methods of small-footprint lidar processing are presented and discussed, validated for tree height estimation, and demonstrated for scanning geometry effects analysis and mobile mapping. The simulation method implemented combines both spatial and radiometric components to produce realistic waveform and point cloud data for system performance analysis and for algorithm development for lidar data processing and mapping purposes. Waveform data generated by the simulator were shown to demonstrate the possibilities of such an approach in system and data verification. As the related empirical data are insufficient for effective research and exploitation in mapping purposes at the moment, the simulated waveform data are needed.A tree location accuracy of 15 cm and tree height underestimation of 0.33 m was found using the simulation model for the TopEye Mk II laser scanner, compared to the artificial forest model reference data. Modeling of light interaction on object surfaces and characteristics of scanning systems provide an opportunity to simulate laser data acquisition of well-defined objects under controlled conditions. By eliminating different sources of error case-by-case, we can improve the knowledge obtained merely from the experimental studies.Data validation in the scanning geometry simulations was carried out by comparing the simulated first echo data to the environment model and, separately, to the first echo data from an independent TopoSys II flight strip that was not used for the environment model computation. The mean differences reveal that the simulator slightly overestimates the object elevations. Deviation between the real TopoSys point cloud and the environmental model was 2 to 3 times larger than that obtained for the simulated Optech and TopoSys data sets.We believe that the developed simulation and modeling is an efficient tool for determining the most reasonable set of flight parameters for any current mapping task, for analyzing change detection possibilities of repeated laser surveys, and for studying and verifying future lidar systems and concepts. However, this requires high-quality modeling of the system and extensive knowledge of the interaction between the laser beam and the object, which should be further developed in the coming years."
"Examination of the Land Surface Temperature Response for Santiago, Chile","Peña, Marco A.",pp. 1191-1200(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000010/art00002;jsessionid=bbxj54w4vfm1.x-ic-live-01,"The causes associated with the land surface temperature (LST) response of Santiago city and its rural surroundings are examined in an attempt to assess the surface urban heat island (SUHI). Seven Landsat and ASTER images acquired on summer mornings between 1998 and 2005 were processed. For each image LST was examined for urban and rural areas, and the main land-cover types, and then correlated with vegetation cover, soil moisture content, and albedo. At the time of data acquisition, the warmer conditions of the dry and poorly vegetated land-covers of the northern rural valley result in a negative SUHI intensity. Meanwhile, the colder conditions of the moist and well vegetated land-covers of the southern rural valley result in a positive SUHI intensity. The strong correlation coefficients retrieved between the above mentioned parameters for the rural area, support the wide thermal range associated with it, which is influenced by the high warming rate of its dry and poorly vegetated landcovers."
Tree Crown Detection on Multispectral VHR Satellite Imagery,"Daliakopoulos, Ioannis N.; Grillakis, Emmanouil G.; Koutroulis, Aristeidis G.; Tsanis, Ioannis K.",pp. 1201-1211(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000010/art00003;jsessionid=bbxj54w4vfm1.x-ic-live-01,"A new method called Arbor Crown Enumerator (ACE) was developed for tree crown detection from multispectral Very High-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery. ACE uses a combination of the Red band and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) thresholding, and the Laplacian of the Gauss-ian (LOG) blob detection method. This method minimizes the detection shortcomings of its individual components and provides a more accurate estimation of the number of tree crowns captured in an image sample. The ACE was applied successfully to sample images taken from a four-band QuickBird (0.7m × 0.7m) scene of Keritis watershed, in the Island of Crete. The method performs very well for different tree types, sizes and densities that may include non vegetation features such as roads and houses. Statistical analysis on the tree crown detection results from the sample images supports the agreement between the measurements and the simulations. The new method reduces considerably the effort of manual tree counting and can be used for environmental applications of fruit orchard, plantation and open forest population monitoring."
A Wavelet and IHS Integration Method to Fuse High Resolution SAR with Moderate Resolution Multispectral Images,"Hong, Gang; Zhang, Yun; Mercer, Bryan",pp. 1213-1223(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000010/art00004;jsessionid=bbxj54w4vfm1.x-ic-live-01,"Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging can be a feasible alternative or a complement to traditional optical remote sensing techniques because it does not depend on solar illumination and weather conditions. The high spatial resolution of SAR, such as the Intermap STAR-3i airborne SAR image with 1.25 m spatial resolution, makes it applicable for high spatial resolution mapping purposes. However, difficulties sometimes exist in the interpretation of SAR images. Image fusion presents an alternative to improve the interpretability of SAR images by fusing the color information from moderate spatial resolution multispectral (MS) images. In this paper, a new fusion method based on the integration of wavelet transform and IHS (Intensity, Hue, and Saturation) transform is proposed for SAR and MS fusion to maintain the spectral content of the original MS image while retaining the spatial detail of the high-resolution SAR image. Three data sets are used to evaluate the proposed fusion method: two sets are airborne SAR images with MS images at different spatial resolutions; the other set is a Radarsat image with a Landsat TM image. The fusion results are evaluated visually and statistically. The evaluation shows that successful results are achieved in the fusion of all SAR and MS images from a variety of sensors with significant spatial and spectral variations by using the proposed image fusion method."
Spectral Distance Decay,"Rocchini, Duccio; Nagendra, Harini; Ghate, Rucha; Cade, Brian S.",pp. 1225-1230(6),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000010/art00005;jsessionid=bbxj54w4vfm1.x-ic-live-01,"Remotely sensed data represents key information for character-izing and estimating biodiversity. Spectral distance among sites has proven to be a powerful approach for detecting species composition variability. Regression analysis of species similarity versus spectral distance may allow us to quantitatively estimate how beta-diversity in species changes with respect to spectral and ecological variability. In classical regression analysis, the residual sum of squares is minimized for the mean of the dependent variable distribution. However, many ecological datasets are characterized by a high number of zeroes that can add noise to the regression model. Quantile regression can be used to evaluate trend in the upper quantiles rather than a mean trend across the whole distribution of the dependent variable. In this paper, we used ordinary least square (OLS) and quantile regression to estimate the decay of species similarity versus spectral distance. The achieved decay rates were statistically nonzero (p < 0.05) considering both OLS and quantile regression. Nonetheless, OLS regression estimate of mean decay rate was only half the decay rate indicated by the upper quantiles. Moreover, the intercept value, representing the similarity reached when spectral distance approaches zero, was very low compared with the intercepts of upper quantiles, which detected high species similarity when habitats are more similar. In this paper we demonstrated the power of using quantile regressions applied to spectral distance decay in order to reveal species diversity patterns otherwise lost or underestimated by ordinary least square regression."
Synchronicity between Satellite-Measured Leaf Phenology and Rainfall Regimes in Tropical Forests,"Park, Sunyurp",pp. 1231-1237(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000010/art00006;jsessionid=bbxj54w4vfm1.x-ic-live-01,"The seasonal and interannual cycles of the canopy phenology of Hawaiian tropical ecosystems were extracted from seven-year MODIS VI data. NDVI responded sensitively to surface greenness of dry-to-mesic ecosystems, but it showed little change as mean annual precipitation (MAP) surpassed 2,000 mm. Canopy greenness seasonality was strongest in dry areas, and its strength had an inverse relationship with MAP (r = -0.75, P < 0.0001). Study results report that the photosynthetic activity of dry biomes responded synchronously to annual rainfall patterns. As MAP increased, the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) had significant variations among wet biomes, and its canopy greenness cycles lagged behind seasonal rainfall cycles. As a result, greenness peaks of dry-to-mesic environments occurred in the wet season, whereas those of wet environments (MAP > 2,000 mm) occurred in the dry season. This result leads to a conclusion that forest productivity of perhumid environments may be limited by reduced solar hours."
A Fast Approach to Best Scanline Search of Airborne Linear Pushbroom Images,"Wang, Mi; Hu, Fen; Li, Jonathan; Pan, Jun",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000009/art00001;jsessionid=1m09uui15tvqd.x-ic-live-03,"The linear pushbroom camera has become one of the most important imaging sensors in today’s photogrammetry and remote sensing practices. Airborne digital sensors (ADS) or three-line scanner (TLS) imaging system such as the ADS40 from Leica Geosystems and STARIMAGER from STAR-LABO Corporation use the pushbroom technique to collect high-resolution, multi-channel seamless image strips. As we know, the object-to-image coordinate computation serves as a core step during the process of photogrammetric images. However, each scanline captured by a linear pushbroom sensor has six exterior orientation (EO) parameters at the corresponding instant of exposure. The image point coordinates will not be accurately calculated through colinearity equations unless reasonable EO parameters are determined. Therefore, the best scanline search (BSS) has direct effects on efficiency of object-to-image coordinate computation during image processing. This paper addresses a fast BSS method based on the novel central perspective plane of scanline (CPPS) constraints. The search process is simply performed through analytical geometric calculations, which can significantly improve the efficiency of the object-to-image coordinate computation. The feasibility and robustness of the proposed method have been verified using ADS40 and STARIMAGER images. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves scanline search speed considerably with the time cost decreased by nearly 85 percent compared with the traditional methods."

Cultivated areas were first identified through large spatial scale mapping using spectral and elevation data. Within the cultivated areas, separation of banana plantations and other land-cover classes increased when including image co-occurrence texture measures and context relationships in addition to spectral information. The results showed that a pixel size of ≤2.5 m was required to accurately identify the row structure within banana plantations, which enabled object-based separation from other crops based on texture information. The user’s and producer’s accuracies for mapping banana plantations increased from 73 percent and 77 percent, respectively, to 94 percent and 93 percent after post-classification visual editing. The results indicate that the data and processing techniques used offer a reliable approach for mapping banana plants and other plantation crops."
A Generic Method for RPC Refinement Using Ground Control Information,"Xiong, Zhen; Zhang, Yun",pp. 1083-1092(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000009/art00003;jsessionid=1m09uui15tvqd.x-ic-live-03,"Geometric sensor models are used in image processing to model the relationship between object space and image space and to transform image data to conform to a map projection. An Rational Polynomial Coefficient (RCP) is a generic sensor model that can be used to transform images from a variety of different high resolution satellite and airborne remote sensing systems. To date, numerous researchers have published papers about RPC refinement, aimed at improving the accuracy of the results. So far, the Bias Compensation method is the one that is the most accepted and widely used, but this method has rigorous conditions that limit its use; namely, it can only be used to improve the RPC of images obtained from cameras with a narrow field of view and small attitude errors, such as those used on Ikonos or QuickBird satellites. In many cases, these rigorous conditions may not be satisfied (e.g., cameras with a wide field of view and some satellites with large ephemeris and attitude errors). Therefore, a more robust method that can be used to refine the RPC under a wider range of conditions is desirable. In this paper, a generic method for RPC refinement is proposed. The method first restores the sensor’s pseudo position and attitude, then adjusts these parameters using ground control points. Finally a new RPC is generated based on the sensor’s adjusted position and attitude. We commence our paper with a review of the previous ten years of research directed toward RPC refinement, and compare the characteristics of different refinement methods that have been proposed to date. We then present a methodology for a proposed generic method for RPC refinement and describe the results of two sets of experiments that compare the proposed Generic method with the Bias Compensation method. The results confirm that the Bias Compensation method works well only when the aforementioned rigorous conditions are met. The accuracy of the RPC refined by the Bias Compensation method decreased rapidly with the sensor’s position error and attitude error.In contrast to this, the Generic method proposed in this paper was found to yield highly accurate results under a variety of different sensor positions and attitudes."

Although the utilization of this technology has increased in different applications, the development of standard methodologies for the quality assurance of lidar systems and quality control of the derived data has not followed the same trend. In other words, a lack of reliable, practical, cost-effective, and commonly-acceptable methods for quality evaluation is evident. A frequently adopted procedure for quality evaluation is the comparison between lidar data and ground control points. Besides being expensive, this approach is not accurate enough for the verification of the horizontal accuracy, which is known to be worse than the vertical accuracy. This paper is dedicated to providing an accurate, economical, and convenient quality control methodology for the evaluation of lidar data. The paper starts with a brief discussion of the lidar mathematical model, which is followed by an analysis of possible random and systematic errors and their impact on the resulting surface. Based on the discussion of error sources and their impact, a tool for evaluating the quality of the derived surface is proposed. In addition to the verification of the data quality, the proposed method can be used for evaluating the system parameters and measurements. Experimental results from simulated and real data demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed tool."

Prior probabilities are designed only for overlapping spectral signatures. Accordingly, their effect on an individual class is independent of the classes that are spectrally separable from this class. The theoretical reasoning reveals that an increased prior probability, which shifts the decision boundary away from the class mean, will increase the assignment and boost the producer’s accuracy as compared to the use of equal priors; though the change of the user’s accuracy is not constant, it is expected to decrease in most cases. The tendency is just the opposite when a lower prior probability is used. A case study was conducted using Landsat TM data provided along with ERDAS Imagine®software. Two other pieces of evidence derived from the published literature are also presented."

Using the high-resolution satellite image processing system developed at The Ohio State University, DGPS (Differential Global Positioning System) controlled ground control points, and a number of check points, we demonstrated: (a) The convergence angle plays an important role in along-track or cross-track stereo mapping, especially in improvement of the accuracy in the vertical direction; (b) Regardless of stereo configuration (along-track or cross-track), the accuracy in the X (cross-track) direction is better than that in the Y (along-track) direction; and (c) Although there is a slight correlation between the convergence angle and the accuracy in the Y (along-track) direction in the case of along-track stereo configuration, no distinct relationship is found in the X (cross-track) direction. Similarly, improvement of the horizontal accuracies is found with increased convergence angles when dealing with cross-track stereo pairs."
Derivation and Validation of High-Resolution Digital Terrain Models from Mars Express HRSC Data,"Gwinner, Klaus; Scholten, Frank; Spiegel, Michael; Schmidt, Ralph; Giese, Bernd; Oberst, Jürgen; Heipke, Christian; Jaumann, Ralf; Neukum, Gerhard",pp. 1127-1142(16),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000009/art00007;jsessionid=1m09uui15tvqd.x-ic-live-03,"The High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) onboard the Mars Express mission is the first photogrammetric stereo sensor system employed for planetary remote sensing. The derivation of high-quality digital terrain models is subject to a variety of parameters, some of which show a significant variability between and also within individual datasets. Therefore, adaptive processing techniques and the use of efficient quality parameters for controlling automated processing are considered to be key requirements for DTM generation. We present the general procedure for the derivation of HRSC high-resolution DTM, representing the core element of the systematic derivation of high-level data products by the Mars Express HRSC experiment team. We also analyze test series applying specific processing variations, including a new method for signal adaptive image preprocessing. The results are assessed based on internal quality measures and compared to external terrain data. Sub-pixel scale 3D point accuracy of better than 10 m and a DTM spatial resolution of up to 50 m can be achieved for large parts of the surface of Mars within a reasonable effort. This confirms the potentials of the applied along-track multiple stereo imaging principle and allows for a considerable improvement in our knowledge of the topography of Mars."
The Land-cover Change Mapper (LCM) and its Application to Timber Harvest Monitoring in Western Canada,"Castilla, Guillermo; Guthrie, Richard H.; Hay, Geoffrey J.",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000008/art00001;jsessionid=kst5wh9pmaeg.x-ic-live-01,"We introduce an automated change detection and delineation tool for remote sensing images: the Land-cover Change Mapper (LCM). LCM rapidly generates a polygon vector layer (shapefile) of regions deemed to have undergone significant change in land-cover. In its simplest usage, LCM requires two single band or multi-band co-registered images of the same scene acquired at different dates, and as the only user-defined parameter, the minimum size for change regions. The main advantages of this tool are that (a) it is fully unsupervised, (b) it is exceptionally fast, (c) it is robust to geometric misregistration errors and variations in illumination, and (d) it produces visually pleasing outlines that resemble those obtained through manual digitization. We describe how the tool works, illustrate its application to monitoring forest clear-cuts on a 1,000 km2area in Western Canada using SPOT imagery, compare it to a commercial tool, and report on its thematic and spatial accuracy. A freeware LCM version is available on the Internet."
Enhancing Binary Change Detection Performance Using A Moving Threshold Window (MTW) Approach,"Im, Jungho; Rhee, Jinyoung; Jensen, John R.",pp. 951-961(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000008/art00002;jsessionid=kst5wh9pmaeg.x-ic-live-01,"This study introduced a new concept, the Moving Threshold Window (MTW), for binary change detection. An automated MTW-based calibration model was developed and evaluated using a case study. The MTW-based model is free from the assumption of symmetry for difference and ratio types of change-enhanced images, unlike traditional binary change detection methods. The MTW-based calibration model outperformed the traditional binary change detection methods based on the Symmetric Threshold Window (STW) for both single and multiple change-enhanced images of the study area. In most of the calibrations, the optimum thresholds resulting in the highest Kappa coefficient were asymmetric. Three major factors may explain the asymmetric characteristics of the optimum thresholds, including: different atmospheric conditions found in the two dates of imagery, different look angles associated with the two dates of imagery, and the nature of the change information. Multiple change-enhanced images generally produced higher accuracies than single change-enhanced images using both the MTW- and STW-based models."
Range of Categorical Associations for Comparison of Maps with Mixed Pixels,"Pontius, Jr., Robert Gilmore; Connors, John",pp. 963-969(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000008/art00003;jsessionid=kst5wh9pmaeg.x-ic-live-01,"This paper presents a method to compare maps that contain pixels that have partial membership to multiple categories, i.e., mixed or soft classified pixels. The method quantifies ranges for associations among categories based upon possible variations in sub-pixel spatial allocation. The paper derives the mathematical equations for constructing the range of associations based on three types of cross-tabulation matrices, the greatest matrix, the random matrix, and the least matrix. We demonstrate how the analysis can be combined with multiple resolution map comparison to specify the resolution at which clusters exist on a single map or between two maps. The method produces a range that reflects the amount of uncertainty in the categorical associations. We illustrate the procedure with both a simple example and data from the Plum Island Ecosystems study site in Massachusetts, USA."
Projection of Land Use Change Patterns using Kernel Logistic Regression,"Wu, Bo; Huang, Bo; Fung, Tung",pp. 971-979(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000008/art00004;jsessionid=kst5wh9pmaeg.x-ic-live-01,"Change analysis is probably a natural step following the detection of changes using remote sensing data. One significant topic in change analysis is to model the changes in relation to their driving factors and to project future land-use patterns. While logistic regression (LR) has been widely used in change modeling, this paper presents an improved method, kernel logistic regression (KLR), to model the nonlinear relationship between land-use change and various causal factors such as population, distance to road and facilities, surrounding land-use, and others. Traditional KLR models contain one coefficient for each training sample, rendering it inappropriate for applications of land-use change analysis with more than a few thousand samples. A feature vectors selection method for the KLR model has therefore been proposed to impose sparsity and control complexity. To test the effectiveness of KLR, a case study was implemented to model rural-urban land-use conversion in the city of Calgary, Canada during the periods 1985 to 1990 and 1990 to 1999. The KLR model was compared with a commonly used LR model in terms of the Percentage of Correct Prediction (PCP), Area under Curve (AUC), and McNamara’s test, and the results consistently demonstrated the better performance of KLR."
A Disturbance-Inventory Framework for Flexible and Reliable Landscape Monitoring,"Linke, J.; McDermid, G.J.; Laskin, D.N.; McLane, A.J.; Pape, A.; Cranston, J.; Hall-Beyer, M.; Franklin, S.E.",pp. 981-995(15),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000008/art00005;jsessionid=kst5wh9pmaeg.x-ic-live-01,"Remote sensing plays a key role in landscape monitoring, but our handling of these data in a multi-temporal time series is not yet fully developed. Of particular concern is the presence of spatial and thematic errors in independently created maps that distort measures of landscape pattern and constrain the reliability of change analysis. In addition, there is a need to incorporate continuous attributes of cover gradients for flexible map representations that support a variety of applications. In this paper, we present a framework for generating temporally and categorically dynamic land-cover maps that provide such a reliable and adaptable foundation. The centerpiece is a spatio-temporal disturbance-inventory database, created through semi-automated change detection and conditioned with boundary-matching procedures, which can be used to backdate and update both continuous and categorical reference maps. We demonstrate our approach using multi-annual Landsat imagery from a forested region in west-central Alberta, Canada, between the years 1998 and 2005."

The phase coupling, synchrony, and information entropy of NDVI at multiple temporal scales for each of these areas were examined. A higher proportion of private land (e.g., 55 percent) resulted in decrease of annual mean, coefficient of variance, seasonal maximum, and absolute value of rate of increase/ rate of decrease for NDVI values as well as increase in seasonal minimum NDVI and decrease in spatial coupling and synchrony of NDVI dynamics. Thus, a higher proportion of private land could affect regional NDVI dynamics in complex and ecologically significant ways."
Individual Object Change Detection for Monitoring the Impact of a Forest Pathogen on a Hardwood Forest,"De Chant, Tim; Kelly, Maggi",pp. 1005-1013(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000008/art00007;jsessionid=kst5wh9pmaeg.x-ic-live-01,"Sudden oak death (SOD) has caused widespread mortality in a number of tree and shrub species throughout coastal Califor-nia. As a result, canopy changes are directly visible from remotely sensed imagery. To quantify changes in horizontal canopy structure to the oak woodlands in China Camp State Park, California, USA, a heavily hit area, we developed a novel change detection technique that tracks changes to individual objects. Using 4-band, 1 m spatial resolution aerial photography, we classified four annual images (2000 to 2003) with object-based image analysis (OBIA) and employed a GIS for our change detection technique. We identified 352 gaps that contained SOD mortality in 2000 and persisted through 2003. Their median areas and perimeters did not change significantly in that time. However, those gaps that increased in size tended to be smaller than those that decreased, indicating increased mortality in newly infected areas. Our new change detection method allowed us to monitor these gaps one-by-one, revealing ecologically meaningful results that would otherwise be obscured in a landscape-scale analysis."
Spatial Change Optimization,"Chandramouli, Magesh; Huang, Bo; Xue, Lulu",pp. 1015-1022(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000008/art00008;jsessionid=kst5wh9pmaeg.x-ic-live-01,"Urban spatial analysis is becoming an increasingly complex problem due to the overwhelming demands imposed by the population and several other factors. Consequently, tools are needed to solve complex urban spatial problems that are multiobjective in nature. This study presents a multiobjec-tive optimization approach to generating alternative land use scenarios and offers a visual evaluation tool for assessing the Pareto solutions. Typically, with genetic algorithms (GA), decision makers are finally left with alternative solutions in the form of the Pareto set, from which one or a few more will be chosen. Hence, a visualization tool is employed in this study, whereby the decision makers can better evaluate the alternative solutions from the Pareto set. Modeling futuristic land uses is devised as an optimization problem wherein spatial configurations are created through the use of evolutionary algorithms. With the goal of sustainable urban land use planning, the evolutionary algorithm is designed for multiple objectives, such as maximization of per capita green space, maximization of urban housing density, maximization of public service space, and conflict resolution among neighboring land uses. The results evince the validity of the GA framework and also corroborate the utility of the virtual scenarios."
An Accuracy Index with Positional and Thematic Fuzzy Bounds for Land-use/Land-cover Maps,"Couturier, Stéphane; Mas, Jean-François; Cuevas, Gabriela; Benítez, Jorge; Vega-Guzmán, Álvaro; Coria-Tapia, Valdemar",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000007/art00001;jsessionid=54h5ovpsgadsm.x-ic-live-02,"This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for the accuracy assessment of taxonomically diverse LULC maps. A widely accepted difficulty in assessing such maps is associated with the vagueness in the interpretation of complex landscapes. For every class of the map, this method quantified the thematic and positional fuzziness of accuracy, induced by this difficulty. The labeling protocol consisted of a fuzzy comparison between the map and a reference maplet, for which degrees of positional and thematic tolerance can be user-defined. The construction of reference maplets permitted a flexible analysis (comparable with the assessment of other maps) of the positional fuzziness of the reference dataset and of the vagueness of the assessment process, while the alternate evaluation protocol, based on traditional point like data collection, did not allow such analysis."

Population in the susceptible areas was estimated to range from 108 (one meter) to 431 million (six meters) people. Among the seven land-cover types in the susceptible areas, forest and grassland account for more than 60 percent for all the increments of sea level rise. A suite of interactive visuali-zation products was also developed to understand and communicate the ramifications of potential sea level rise."
Forest Type Mapping using Object-specific Texture Measures from Multispectral Ikonos Imagery,"Kim, Minho; Madden, Marguerite; Warner, Timothy A.",pp. 819-829(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000007/art00003;jsessionid=54h5ovpsgadsm.x-ic-live-02,"This study investigated the use of a geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) approach with the incorporation of object-specific grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture measures from a multispectral Ikonos image for delineation of deciduous, evergreen, and mixed forest types in Guilford Courthouse National Military Park, North Carolina. A series of automated segmentations was produced at a range of scales, each resulting in an associated range of number and size of objects (or segments). Prior to classification, the spatial autocorrelation of each segmentation was evaluated by calculating Moran’s I using the average image digital numbers (DNs) per segment. An initial assumption was made that the optimal segmentation scales would have the lowest spatial autocorrelation, and conversely, that over- and under-segmentation would result in higher autocorrelation between segments. At these optimal segmentation scales, the automated segmentation was found to yield information comparable to manually interpreted stand-level forest maps in terms of the size and classification of images identified from a spatial autocorre-lation analysis to have an optimal segmentation, compared to those determined to have over- and under-segmentation. An overall accuracy of 79 percent with a Kappa of 0.65 was obtained at the optimal segmentation scale of 19. The addition of object-specific GLCM multiple texture analysis improved classification accuracies up to a value of 83 percent overall accuracy and a Kappa of 0.71 by reducing the confusion between evergreen and mixed forest types. Although some misclassification still remained because of local segmentation quality, a visual assessment of the texture-enhanced GEOBIA classification generally agreeable with manually interpreted forest types."
Developing Collaborative Classifiers using an Expert-based Model,"Mountrakis, Giorgos; Watts, Raymond; Luo, Lori; Wang, Jida",pp. 831-843(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000007/art00004;jsessionid=54h5ovpsgadsm.x-ic-live-02,"This paper presents a hierarchical, multi-stage adaptive strategy for image classification. We iteratively apply various classification methods (e.g., decision trees, neural networks), identify regions of parametric and geographic space where accuracy is low, and in these regions, test and apply alternate methods repeating the process until the entire image is classified. Currently, classifiers are evaluated through human input using an expert-based system; therefore, this paper acts as the proof of concept for collaborative classifiers. Because we decompose the problem into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks, our classification exhibits increased flexibility compared to existing methods since classification methods are tailored to the idiosyncrasies of specific regions. A major benefit of our approach is its scalability and collaborative support since selected low-accuracy classifiers can be easily replaced with others without affecting classification accuracy in high accuracy areas. At each stage, we develop spatially explicit accuracy metrics that provide straightforward assessment of results by non-experts and point to areas that need algorithmic improvement or ancillary data. Our approach is demonstrated in the task of detecting impervious surface areas, an important indicator for human-induced alterations to the environment, using a 2001 Landsat scene from Las Vegas, Nevada."
Automated Urban Delineation from Landsat Imagery Based on Spatial Information Processing,"Guindon, Bert; Zhang, Ying",pp. 845-858(14),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000007/art00005;jsessionid=54h5ovpsgadsm.x-ic-live-02,"Methodologies are developed and assessed for the delineation of urban areas on moderate resolution satellite images based on line feature extraction and processing. It is argued that a simple two component urban/rural road network model and a preliminary estimate of the extent of urban cover in a satellite scene can be used to quantify processing settings, such as line thresholds. As a result, urban delineation can be fully automated. Tests have been conducted with Landsat Thematic Mapper data of a candidate set of cities that exemplify the spectrum of North American urban landscapes. Producer accuracies in the range 60 to 80 percent are consistently for a variety of urban landscapes. While these performance levels are lower than those previously reported for small area, city-specific studies, they are comparable to those previously achieved in large-area, approaches (e.g., the National Land Cover Dataset initiative) that rely primarily on spectral attributes. It is concluded that better integrated use of spectral-spatial data processing have the potential to lead to improved operational urban mapping accuracies."

Satellite surveillance has several obvious advantages over current methods, which consist of expensive single-point measurements made from pressure sensors, video surveillance, etc., in/or close to the road. The main limitation of using satellite surveillance is the time resolution; the continuously changing traffic situation must be deduced from a snapshot image. In cooperation with the Norwegian Road Authorities, we have developed an approach for detection of vehicles in Quick-Bird images. The algorithm consists of a segmentation step followed by object-based maximum likelihood classification. Additionally, we propose a new approach for prediction of vehicle shadows. The shadow information is used as a contextual feature in order to improve classification. The correct classification rate was 89 percent, excluding noise samples. The proposed method tends to underestimate the number of vehicles when compared to manual counts and in-road equipment counts."

This study describes an object-based classification technique to extract vehicle volumes and vehicle type distributions from aerial photos sampled throughout a large metropolitan area. We developed rules for optimizing segmentation parameters, and used feature space optimization to choose classification attributes and develop fuzzy-set memberships for classification. Vehicles were extracted from street areas with 91.8 percent accuracy. Furthermore, separation of vehicles into classes based on car, medium-sized truck, and buses/heavy truck definitions was achieved with 87.5 percent accuracy. We discuss implications of these results for traffic volume analysis and parameterization of existing noise and air pollution models, and suggest future work for traffic assessment using high-resolution remotely-sensed imagery."

Having accurate length information of road centerlines is critical in transportation. This paper presents a geographic information system (GIS)-based approach that overlays planimetric road centerlines and elevation data to model road centerlines in a 3D space and estimate their lengths. Elevation sources included light detection and ranging (lidar) and the National Elevation Dataset (NED). The estimated distances were compared to distance measurement instrument (DMI)-measured distances to evaluate the accuracy. The effects of elevation datasets with varying vertical accuracies were assessed. The relationship between road geometric properties and the accuracy of distance estimates was examined. We found that (a) the proposed 3D approach is efficient in estimating 3D road centerline distances, (b) using lidar point data improves the accuracy by 28 percent over the use of NED, and (c) certain road geometric properties have direct relationship with the accuracy of distance estimates."

The present region-based variational model is fully automated without the need to manually specify the position of the initial contour. Furthermore, it converges after a small number of iterations, allowing real-time applications. The developed algorithm was tested for the detection of roads, buildings and other man-made objects in a number of aerial and satellite images. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated by the experimental results and the performed qualitative and quantitative evaluation."

To overcome this difficulty, an adaptive thresholding criterion was proposed. By applying it to SAR and optical images for terrain cover classification, comparisons between the multiple classifiers systems using the Bagging and/or Boosting algorithms with and without the adaptive thresholding criterion were made. Experimental results showed that the classification substantially improved when the adaptive thresholding criterion was used, especially when the level of ambiguity of targets was high."

Occlusion-based Methodology for the Classification of Lidar Data,"Habib, Ayman F.; Chang, Yu-Chuan; Lee, Dong Cheon",pp. 703-712(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000006/art00005;jsessionid=2alpm62gf6qa9.x-ic-live-03,"Lidar systems have been widely adopted for the acquisition of dense and accurate topographic data over extended areas. The level of detail and the quality of the collected point cloud motivated the research community to investigate the possibility of automatic object extraction from such data. Prior knowledge of the terrain surface will improve the performance of object detection and extraction procedures. In this paper, a new strategy for automatic terrain extraction from lidar data is presented. The proposed strategy is based on the fact that sudden elevation changes, which usually correspond to non-ground objects, will cause relief displacements in perspective views. The introduced relief displacements will occlude neighboring ground points. To start the process, we generate a digital surface model (DSM) from the irregular lidar points using an interpolation procedure. The presence of sudden-elevation changes and the resulting occlusions can be discerned by sequentially checking the off-nadir angles to the lines of sight connecting the DSM cells and a pre-defined set of synthesized projection centers. Detected occlusions are then used to identify the occluding points, which are hypothesized to be non-ground points. Surface roughness and discontinuities together with inherent noise in the point cloud will lead to some false hypotheses. Therefore, we use a statistical filter to remove these false hypotheses. The performance of the algorithm has been evaluated and verified using both simulated and real lidar datasets with varying levels of complexity."
Isomorphism in Digital Elevation Models and Its Implication to Interpolation Functions,"Hu, Peng; Liu, Xiaohang; Hu, Hai",pp. 713-721(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000006/art00006;jsessionid=2alpm62gf6qa9.x-ic-live-03,"Terrain is an ordered surface where locations relate to each other through their elevations. Preservation of this topographic orderliness by an interpolation method so that “if point A is higher than point B in the terrain, the interpolated elevation of A remains higher” is important to assure the practical value of the resultant DEM. Based on the concepts in group theory, this paper points out that a DEM must be isomorphic to terrain surface in order to preserve the topographic orderliness. Such a DEM, if generated through interpolation, can only be obtained if the interpolation function is an isomorphism. Two necessary conditions for isomorphism are identified: a one-to-one relationship between the topographic surface and the surface corresponding to the interpolation function, and the feasibility to configure the topographic surface into monotonic patches during interpolation. The isomorphism of three widely used interpolation methods is examined. It is found that linear interpolation in 1D and TIN are both isomorphisms, meaning that a DEM interpolated by either method can preserve the topographic orderliness. In contrast, bilinear interpolation is not an isomorphism. Considering the practical challenges in assuring the necessary conditions of isomorphism in each method, linear interpolation in 1D is recommended as the optimal method to interpolate a DEM."

The few PIFs were selected subjectively following the low number of potentially invariant sectors available on the scenes. Both approaches provided a similar radiometric variation (6S = 4.3 percent; PIFs = 4.0 percent). The latter increased from water to pine trees, to roofs and sand, with five reference points per feature being identified as cost effective. The withdrawing of variant features among the PIFs across dates or points caused a significant decrease in radiometric variation, especially with 6S (6S = 2.8 percent, PIFs = 3.4 percent). As many as 31 point per type of PIFs would be necessary to provide a radiometric variation that is not significantly different from that obtained with 6S, whereas nearly 300 and 4,000 points per feature would be required to provide similar or better results than the 6S code, respectively. Use of a few PIFs remains a valid approach, as long as the invariant sectors cover a wide range of brightness and are represented by objects of which the radiometric variation has preliminarily been tested."
Synchronization of Image Sequences - A Photogrammetric Method,"Raguse, Karsten; Heipke, Christian",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000005/art00001;jsessionid=4gsu5i0qbcch6.x-ic-live-01,"The three-dimensional photogrammetric analysis of image sequences is a growing field of application. For the analysis of dynamic processes one important precondition has to be guaranteed: All cameras have to be synchronized, otherwise the results are affected by asynchronism. In this article a new method is presented, which can determine the asyn-chronism of an arbitrary number of image sequences. In contrast to already existing methods, in the new approach the asynchronism is modeled in object space and then converted into an interpolation function containing a set of unknowns for each camera. In this form the asynchronism is introduced into an extended bundle adjustment, in which the unknowns are solved simultaneously with the image orientation parameters and the object coordinates of tie points. Therefore, the approach has no restrictions with regard to the number and the set-up of the cameras in the acquisition network. Furthermore, both the temporal and spatial analysis step are carried out simultaneously.We have implemented the suggested method and have run anumber of experiments in the context of vehicle impact testing. First, sequences with a frame rate of 1,000 Hz observing an object with a speed of up to 7 m/s and an asynchro-nism of 0.8 ms were analyzed. The accuracy of the object point determination could be improved by a factor of 10. Then, five sequences of a vehicle impact test with a speed of 15.6 m/s were investigated. Here, errors in the object coordinates of up to 30 mm could be eliminated using the new approach. Given the small tolerances in car development, this improvement in point accuracy is significant."
An Emissivity Modulation Method for Spatial Enhancement of Thermal Satellite Images in Urban Heat Island Analysis,"Nichol, Janet",pp. 547-556(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000005/art00002;jsessionid=4gsu5i0qbcch6.x-ic-live-01,"This study examines and validates a technique for spatial enhancement of thermal satellite images for urban heat island analysis, using a nighttime ASTER satellite image. The technique, termed Emissivity Modulation, enhances the spatial resolution while simultaneously correcting the image derived temperatures for emissivity differences of earth surface materials. A classified image derived from a higher resolution visible wavelength sensor is combined with a lower resolution thermal image in the emissivity correction equation in a procedure derived from the Stephan Bolzmann law. This has the effect of simultaneously correcting the image-derived “Brightness Temperature” (Tb) to the true Kinetic Temperature (Ts), while enhancing the spatial resolution of the thermal data. Although the method has been used for studies of the urban heat island, it has not been validated by comparison with “in situ” derived surface or air temperatures, and researchers may be discouraged from its use due to the fact that it creates sharp boundaries in the image. The emissivity modulated image with 10 m pixel size was found to be highly correlated with 18 in situ surface and air temperature measurements and a low Mean Absolute Difference of 1 K was observed between image and in situ surface temperatures. Lower accuracies were obtained for theTsandTbimages at 90 m resolution. The study demonstrates that the emissivity modulation method can increase accuracy in the computation of kinetic temperature, improve the relationship between image values and air temperature, and enable the observation of microscale temperature patterns."
Modification of Pixel-swapping Algorithm with Initialization from a Sub-pixel/pixel Spatial Attraction Model,"Shen, Zhangquan; Qi, Jiaguo; Wang, Ke",pp. 557-567(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000005/art00003;jsessionid=4gsu5i0qbcch6.x-ic-live-01,"Pixel-swapping algorithm is a simple and efficient technique for sub-pixel mapping (Atkinson, 2001 and 2005). It was initially applied in shoreline and rural land-cover mapping but has been expanded to other land-cover mapping. However, due to its random initializing process, this algorithm must swap a large number of sub-pixels, and therefore it is computation intensive. This computing power consumption intensifies when the scale factor is large. A new, modified pixel-swapping algorithm (MPS) is presented in this paper to reduce the computation time, as well as to improve sub-pixel mapping accuracy. The MPS algorithm replaces the original random initializing process with a process based on a sub-pixel/pixel spatial attraction model. The new algorithm was used to allocate multiple land-covers at the sub-pixel level. The results showed that the MPS algorithm outperformed the original algorithm both in sub-pixel mapping accuracy and computational time. The improvement is especially significant in the case of large scale factors. Furthermore, the MPS is less sensitive to the size of neighboring sub-pixels and can still result in increased accuracy even if the size of neighbors is small. The MPS was also much less time consuming, as it reduced both the iterations and total amount of swapping needed."
Closest Spectral Fit for Removing Clouds and Cloud Shadows,"Meng, Qingmin; Borders, Bruce E.; Cieszewski, Chris J.; Madden, Marguerite",pp. 569-576(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000005/art00004;jsessionid=4gsu5i0qbcch6.x-ic-live-01,"Completely cloud-free remotely sensed images are preferred, but they are not always available. Although the average cloud coverage for the entire planet is about 40 percent, the removal of clouds and cloud shadows is rarely studied. To address this problem, a closest spectral fit method is developed to replace cloud and cloud-shadow pixels with their most similar non-clouded pixel values. The objective of this paper is to illustrate the methodology of the closest spectral fit and test its performance for removing clouds and cloud shadows in images. The closest spectral fit procedures are summarized into six steps, in which two main conceptions, location-based one-to-one correspondence and spectral-based closest fit, are defined. The location-based one-to-one correspondence is applied to identify pixels with the same locations in both base image and auxiliary images. The spectral-based closest fit is applied to determine the most similar pixels in an image. Finally, this closest spectral fit approach is applied to remove cloud and cloud-shadow pixels and diagnostically checked using Landsat TM images. Additional examples using Quick-Bird and MODIS images also indicate the efficiency of the closest spectral fit for removing cloud pixels."
Land Cover Classification with Multi-Sensor Fusion of Partly Missing Data,"Aksoy, Selim; Koperski, Krzysztof; Tusk, Carsten; Marchisio, Giovanni",pp. 577-593(17),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000005/art00005;jsessionid=4gsu5i0qbcch6.x-ic-live-01,"We describe a system that uses decision tree-based tools for seamless acquisition of knowledge for classification of remotely sensed imagery. We concentrate on three important problems in this process: information fusion, model understandability, and handling of missing data. Importance of multi-sensor information fusion and the use of decision tree classifiers for such problems have been well-studied in the literature. However, these studies have been limited to the cases where all data sources have a full coverage for the scene under consideration. Our contribution in this paper is to show how decision tree classifiers can be learned with alternative (surrogate) decision nodes and result in models that are capable of dealing with missing data during both training and classification to handle cases where one or more measurements do not exist for some locations. We present detailed performance evaluation regarding the effectiveness of these classifiers for information fusion and feature selection, and study three different methods for handling missing data in comparative experiments. The results show that surrogate decisions incorporated into decision tree classifiers provide powerful models for fusing information from different data layers while being robust to missing data."
Spectral Angle Minimization for the Retrieval of Optically Active Seawater Constituents from MODIS Data,"Maselli, F.; Massi, L.; Pieri, M.; Santini, C.",pp. 595-605(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000005/art00006;jsessionid=4gsu5i0qbcch6.x-ic-live-01,"The application of global algorithms to optical satellite imagery often fails to correctly assess the concentrations of seawater constituents (chlorophyll, CHL, suspended sediments, SS, and yellow substance, YS) in spectrally complex marine environments. Additional problems may come from inaccurate radiometric, atmospheric, and geometric corrections of the remotely sensed imagery. This issue is currently analyzed using a data set of seawater samples and MODIS images taken in the Tuscany Sea (Central Italy). The analysis demonstrates that the mentioned problems mainly introduce amplitude variations in the measured reflectance. This may have negative effects on the outcome of inversion algorithms based on the minimization of conventional spectral errors. Such effects can be notably reduced by using an error index derived from the angle between measured and simulated reflectance vectors, which is insensitive to spectral amplitude variations. The potential of a classical and the new error indices is first evaluated by regressing their values against concentration differences of optically active constituents found over the available sample pairs. The performance of the two error indices are then assessed within an inversion algorithms applied to the same samples. The results obtained show the potential of the new error index particularly to improve the estimation of CHL concentration."
Multi-temporal RADARSAT-1 and ERS Backscattering Signatures of Coastal Wetlands in Southeastern Louisiana,"Kwoun, Oh-ig; Lu, Zhong",pp. 607-617(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000005/art00007;jsessionid=4gsu5i0qbcch6.x-ic-live-01,"Using multi-temporal European Remote-sensing Satellites (ERS-1/-2) and Canadian Radar Satellite (RADARSAT-1) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data over the Louisiana coastal zone, we characterize seasonal variations of radar backscat-tering according to vegetation type. Our main findings are as follows. First, ERS-1/-2 and RADARSAT-1 require careful radiometric calibration to perform multi-temporal backscattering analysis for wetland mapping. We use SAR backscattering signals from cities for the relative calibration. Second, using seasonally averaged backscattering coefficients from ERS-1/-2 and RADARSAT-1, we can differentiate most forests (bottomland and swamp forests) and marshes (freshwater, intermediate, brackish, and saline marshes) in coastal wetlands. The student t-test results support the usefulness of season-averaged backscatter data for classification. Third, combining SAR backscattering coefficients and an optical-sensor-based normalized difference vegetation index can provide further insight into vegetation type and enhance the separation between forests and marshes. Our study demonstrates that SAR can provide necessary information to characterize coastal wetlands and monitor their changes."
Canopy Reflectance Model Inversion in Multiple Forward Mode,"Soenen, S.A.; Peddle, D.R.; Coburn, C.A.; Hall, R.J.; Hall, F.G.",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000004/art00001;jsessionid=1mbqpptudidda.x-ic-live-02,"Remote estimation of canopy structure is important in forestry and a variety of environmental applications. Multiple Forward Mode (MFM) look-up table (LUT) inversion of canopy reflectance models is one approach for obtaining forest canopy biophysical-structural information (BSI). MFM provides inversion results from models that are not invertible directly, and has advantages in terms of software requirements, model complexity, computational demands, and provision of physically-based BSI output. Proper handling of MFM-LUT parameterization and inherent uncertainty in the inversion procedure at the critical final BSI retrieval stage is essential, and is the theme of this paper. Three approaches are presented for deriving BSI from MFMLUT multiple solution sets: reflectance equality (REQ), nearest spectral distance (NSD), and spectral range domain (SRD). These approaches were validated at a Rocky Mountain test site, for which SRD corresponded best with field data, with RMSE 0.4 m and 0.8 m obtained for horizontal and vertical crown radius, respectively. Recommendations for selecting MFM inversion approaches are provided for future applications."
Hemispheric Image Modeling and Analysis Techniques for Solar Radiation Determination in Forest Ecosystems,"Schwalbe, Ellen; Maas, Hans-Gerd; Kenter, Manuela; Wagner, Sven",pp. 375-384(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000004/art00002;jsessionid=1mbqpptudidda.x-ic-live-02,"Hemispheric image processing with the goal of solar radiation determination from ground-based fisheye images is a valuable tool for silvicultural analysis in forest ecosystems. The basic idea of the technique is taking a hemispheric crown image with a camera equipped with a 180° fisheye lens, segmenting the image in order to identify solar radiation relevant open sky areas, and then merging the open sky area with a radiation and sun-path model in order to compute the total annual or seasonal solar radiation for a plant. The results of hemispheric image processing can be used to quantitatively evaluate the growth chances of ground vegetation (e.g., tree regeneration) in forest ecosystems.This paper shows steps towards the operationalization and optimization of the method. As a prerequisite to support geometric handling and georeferencing of hemispheric images, an equi-angular camera model is shown to describe the imaging geometry of fisheye lenses. The model is extended by a set of additional parameters to handle deviations from the ideal model. In practical tests, a precision potential of 0.1 pixels could be obtained with off-the-shelf fisheye lenses. In addition, a method for handling the effects of chromatic aberration, which may amount to several pixels in fisheye lens systems, is discussed. The central topic of the paper is the development of a versatile method for segmenting hemispheric forest crown images. The method is based on linear segment-oriented classification on radial profiles. It combines global thresholding techniques with local image analysis to ensure a reliable segmentation in different types of forest under various cloud conditions. Sub-pixel classification is incorporated to optimize the accuracy of the method. The performance of the developed method is validated in a number of practical tests."
Application of Association Rule Mining for Exploring the Relationship between Urban Land Surface Temperature and Biophysical/Social Parameters,"Rajasekar, Umamaheshwaran; Weng, Qihao",pp. 385-396(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000004/art00003;jsessionid=1mbqpptudidda.x-ic-live-02,"This paper explores the relationship between remote sensing measurements of land surface temperature and biophysical/socioeconomic data by utilizing the association rule mining technique. The surfaces associated with urban uses typically radiate more heat as compared to its rural counterparts. There is a need to quantitatively analyze this contrast in temperature and the biophysical and social characteristics which influence it. Furthermore, in order to consider the urban heat island (UHI) effect, a parameterization is required to account for the urban surface characteristics impacts on the magnitude of land surface temperature (LST). The association rule mining model has demonstrated to bring in additional quantitative information concerning the relationships among urban parameters. The ASTER data from 2000 was used for the selection of appropriate variables to be used in the model. This information was then used for generating association rules between land-use land-cover (LULC) and LST information from 2000, 2001, and 2004. The results thus obtained quantitatively described the relationships between various urban parameters. It was found that there was little change in the percentage area of the LULC types from 2000 to 2004. This made the comparison of the results possible. In the case of the 2000 data, it was found that forest and impervious surfaces had strong association with temperature and scaled normalized difference vegetation index (SNDVI). Specific zones such as hospitals and universities had negative association with water. The comparison of data from 2000, 2001, and 2004 suggests that impervious surface and the zoning category of airport had a strong association. Nevertheless, the information extracted needs to be analyzed in greater detail in order to arrive at robust decision rules. Overall, the model so developed has demonstrated to be effective in predicting associations between urban LST and pertinent factors. This model could be useful for urban planners and environmental managers in quantifying rules that characterize a particular urban landscape."
An Assessment of Geometric Activity Features for Per-pixel Classification of Urban Man-made Objects using Very High Resolution Satellite Imagery,"Chan, Jonathan Cheung-Wai; Bellens, Rik; Canters, Frank; Gautama, Sidharta",pp. 397-411(15),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000004/art00004;jsessionid=1mbqpptudidda.x-ic-live-02,"In this paper, we propose the use of Geometric Activity (GA) features for detecting man-made objects in urban areas using VHR satellite imagery. These features describe the geometric context of a pixel without the necessity of segmentation and can be integrated as extra bands in a per-pixel classification. Two main types of GA features were investigated: ridge features based on the well-known facet model and morphological features obtained by applying closing transforms with structuring elements of different size and shape. Our findings show a substantial increase in classification accuracy for the man-made object classes “roads and buildings with dark roof” after inclusion of GA features. Next to GA features, the use of object-based features derived from eCognition®, containing both geometric and textural information, was also investigated for per-pixel classification. Accuracies obtained with object-based features are comparable to the accuracies obtained with GA features. The inclusion of both GA features and object-based features further improves the overall accuracy. GA features and object-based features thus contain complementary information."
Agro-ecological Interpretation of Rice Cropping Systems in Flood-prone Areas using MODIS Imagery,"Sakamoto, Toshihiro; Van Cao, Phung; Van Nguyen, Nhan; Kotera, Akihiko; Yokozawa, Masayuki",pp. 413-424(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000004/art00005;jsessionid=1mbqpptudidda.x-ic-live-02,"This study attempts a new approach using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time-series imagery to evaluate the agro-ecological interpretation of rice-cropping systems in flood-prone areas. A series of wavelet-based methodologies were applied to reveal the dynamic relationships among annual flood inundation, rice phenology, and land-use change in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). The rice-heading dates of multi-cropping areas were estimated by detecting the local maximal points in smoothed Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) profiles, using the Wavelet-based Filter for determining Crop Phenology (WFCP) and Wavelet-based Filter for evaluating the spatial distribution of Cropping Systems (WFCS) methods. The temporal information for annual flood intensity was determined for the six annual flood seasons over the period from 2000 to 2005 by the Wavelet-based Filter for detecting spatio-temporal changes in the Flood Inundation (WFFI) method. Analysis using remote sensing techniques revealed an interaction between the regional environment and agricultural activity in the VMD. First, comparing the estimated heading date of the winter-spring rice with the end date of flood inundation showed that the cropping season for the winter-spring rice in the flood-prone area fluctuates depending on the annual change in flood scale. This result implied that the onset of winter-spring rice is spatially and temporally linked to the variable flood-recession season, and hence the annual change in flood scale. Secondly, the field survey study of the yearly change in the rice-cropping system in the An Giang province from 2000 to 2006 showed that the triple rice-cropped area in the An Giang province expanded from 2000 to 2005, because the construction of a ring-dyke system and water-resource infrastructure allowed an additional rice crop to be sustained during the flood season. However, the area of the third rice crop in the An Giang province decreased drastically in 2006 as a result of the management of pest outbreaks. Although the regional water-resource environment was gradually transformed by the construction of water-resource infrastructure, in order to achieve favorable conditions for a third rice crop during the flood season, the rapid change in land-use for agricultural activity may complicate the spatio-temporal configuration of the agricultural environment in the VMD. This case study used MODIS time-series imagery to help understand the functions of the macro-scale ecosystem, including annual flood regimes and human activity."
Evaluating AISA + Hyperspectral Imagery for Mapping Black Mangrove along the South Texas Gulf Coast,"Yang, Chenghai; Everitt, James H.; Fletcher, Reginald S.; Jensen, Ryan R.; Mausel, Paul W.",pp. 425-435(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000004/art00006;jsessionid=1mbqpptudidda.x-ic-live-02,"Mangrove wetlands are economically and ecologically important ecosystems and accurate assessment of these wetlands with remote sensing can assist in their management and conservation. This study was conducted to evaluate airborne AISA+ hyperspectral imagery and image transformation and classification techniques for mapping black mangrove populations on the south Texas Gulf coast. AISA+ hyperspectral imagery was acquired from two study sites and both minimum noise fraction (MNF) and inverse MNF transforms were performed. Four classification methods, including minimum distance, Mahalanobis distance, maximum likelihood, and spectral angle mapper (SAM), were applied to the noise-reduced hyperspectral imagery and to the band-reduced MNF imagery for distinguishing black mangrove from associated plant species and other cover types. Accuracy assessment showed that overall accuracy varied from 84 percent to 95 percent for site 1 and from 69 percent to 91 percent for site 2 among the eight classifications for each site. The MNF images provided similar or better classification results compared with the hyperspectral images among the four classifiers. Kappa analysis showed that there were no significant differences among the four classifiers with the MNF imagery, though maximum likelihood provided excellent overall and class accuracies for both sites. Producer’s and user’s accuracies for black mangrove were 91 percent and 94 percent, respectively, for site 1 and both 91 percent for site 2 based on maximum likelihood applied to the MNF imagery. These results indicate that airborne hyper-spectral imagery combined with image transformation and classification techniques can be a useful tool for monitoring and mapping black mangrove distributions in coastal environments."
Morphology-based Building Detection from Airborne Lidar Data,"Meng, Xuelian; Wang, Le; Currit, Nate",pp. 437-442(6),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000004/art00007;jsessionid=1mbqpptudidda.x-ic-live-02,"The advent of Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) technique provides a promising resource for three-dimensional building detection. Due to the difficulty of removing vegetation, most building detection methods fuse lidar data with multi-spectral images for vegetation indices and relatively few approaches use only lidar data. However, the fusing process may cause errors introduced by resolution and time difference, shadow and high-rise building displacement problems, and the geo-referencing process. This research presents a morphological building detecting method to identify buildings by gradually removing non-building pixels. First, a ground-filtering algorithm separates ground pixels with buildings, trees, and other objects. Then, an analytical approach removes the remaining non-building pixels using size, shape, height, building element structure, and the height difference between the first and last returns. The experimental results show that this method provides a comparative performance with an overall accuracy of 95.46 percent as in a study site in Austin urban area."
Assessing Spatial Uncertainty of Lidar-derived Building Model,"Cheuk, Mang Lung; Yuan, May",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000003/art00001;jsessionid=um2n7xqfpfkk.x-ic-live-01,"Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) technology enables cost-effective rapid production of digital models that capture topography and vertical structures of surface features at a fine spatial resolution. The capability has promoted lidar applications for mapping terrain, buildings, forest stands, and coastal features that cannot be adequately captured by other remote sensing means over a large area. However, in complex terrain, lidar data and lidar-derived products may contain significant uncertainty. This research provides a simple method to assess the spatial uncertainty of lidar-derived building model, using downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma as an example. Results indicate that significant uncertainty could be found in urban environment where: (a) building structures are complex, (b) buildings are constructed with reflective materials, and (c) vegetation grows near-by. In addition, cities under rapid development also challenge the accuracy assessment of 3D building models. To conclude, we suggest: (a) careful pre-flight planning before data collection, (b) improve the feature extraction algorithm if possible, (c) use of other remote sensing data, and (d) accuracy assessment on suggested urban environments to reduce the spatial uncertainty of lidar data and lidar-derived products."
Reconstruction of Complex Shape Buildings from Lidar Data Using Free Form Surfaces,"Akel, Nizar Abo; Filin, Sagi; Doytsher, Yerach",pp. 271-280(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000003/art00002;jsessionid=um2n7xqfpfkk.x-ic-live-01,"Building reconstruction from lidar data offers promising prospects for rapid generation of large-scale 3D models autonomously. Such reconstruction requires knowledge on a variety of parameters that refer to both the point cloud and the modeled buildings. The complexity of the reconstruction task has led researchers to use external information to localize buildings and assume that they consist of only planar parts. These assumptions limit the reconstruction of complex buildings, particularly those having curved faces. We present in this paper a detection and reconstruction model that considers the point cloud as the only information source and supports the reconstruction of general shape surfaces. Nonetheless, since many of the buildings are composed of planar faces, we maintain the planar based partitioning whenever possible and model non-planar surfaces only where needed. This way, standard models are extended to support free-form roof shapes without imposing artificial models. In addition to the free-form surface extension, we demonstrate the effect of imposing geometric constraints on the reconstruction as a means to generate realistic building models."

First, a slope map is produced by the proposed slope estimator that combines the well-known D8 and finite difference methods. In the second step, the Laplacian of Gaussian (LOG) operator with multiple thresholds is applied to the resultant slope map to determine edge pixels that have local maximum curvature and maximum connectivity. The third step adopts the original and robust marching square algorithms to trace the topographic features. Modification is made to selectively introduce shoulder points according to the local topographic complexity. In comparison to the existing algorithms, the performance of the proposed adaptive marching square algorithm is evaluated in terms of precision and resolution of the extracted features. Digital terrain models over three locations in Antarctica are used for this study. It is shown overall reducing 75 percent of the shoulder points from the robust algorithm will cause 24 percent precision drop in the adaptive method."
Scaling Effect on the Relationship between Landscape Pattern and Land Surface Temperature,"Liu, Hua; Weng, Qihao",pp. 291-304(14),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000003/art00004;jsessionid=um2n7xqfpfkk.x-ic-live-01,"The objective of this paper is to examine the scaling-up effect on the relationship between landscape patterns and land surface temperatures based on a case study of Indianapolis, United States. The integration of remote sensing, GIS, and landscape ecology methods was used in this study. Four TERRA ASTER images were acquired to derive the land-use and land-cover (LULC) patterns and land surface temperatures (LST) in different seasons. Each LULC and LST image was resampled to eight spatial scales: 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 250, 500, and 1,000 m. The scaling-up effect on the spatial and ecological characteristics of landscape patterns and LSTs were examined by the use of landscape metrics. Optimal spatial resolutions were determined on the basis of the minimum distance in the landscape metric spaces. The results show that the patch percentages of LULC and LST patches were not strongly affected by the scaling-up process in different seasons. The patch densities and landscape shape indices and LST patches kept decreasing across the scales without distinct seasonal differences. Thirty meters was found to be the optimal resolution in the study of the relationship between urban LULC and LST classes. Ninety meters was found to be the optimal spatial resolution for assessing the landscape-level relationship between LULC and LST patterns. This paper may provide useful information for urban planners and environmental practitioners to manage urban landscapes and urban thermal environments as a result of urbanization."

Direct sensor orientation using a calibrated GPS/INS system can potentially eliminate the need for ground control points and aerial triangulation, and consequently, result in a great reduction in the cost and time of aerial photogrammetry. Previous studies have shown that, compared to conventional aerial triangulation, direct sensor orientation yields larger errors in the image and object space. It has also been shown that including a number of tie points within an integrated orientation approach can result in a reduction of errors in the image space. In this paper, the influence of the number and distribution of tie points on integrated orientation is investigated. Experiments with various numbers of tie points regularly as well as randomly distributed are presented. Results indicate that an increase in the number of tie points up to one point per model results in a considerable reduction of the errors in the image space."
Effects of Mismatches of Scale and Location between Predictor and Response Variables on Forest Structure Mapping,"Xu, Yaguang; Dickson, Brett G.; Hampton, Haydee M.; Sisk, Thomas D.; Palumbo, Jean A.; Prather, John W.",pp. 313-322(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000003/art00006;jsessionid=um2n7xqfpfkk.x-ic-live-01,"Measurement error introduced by mismatches of scale and location between response and predictor variables is one of the major sources of error in forest structure mapping. It affects the evaluation of analytical models, compromises the results of accuracy assessments, and reduces the accuracy of mapping products. Using forest structure attributes measured in a specifically-designed ground plot system, we isolated the measurement error from the total mapping errors that are related to multiple factors, and examined the distribution and magnitude of this error caused by a scale mismatch between a relatively larger forest unit and a relatively smaller forest unit, as well as location mismatch of a specific distance between two forest units of the same size. We demonstrated the effects of measurement error on the analytical models and resulting maps for three common mapping scenarios linking ground data with remote sensing imagery. Our results indicated that this scale- and location-related error can be analyzed using the Classical and Berkson error models in most practical mapping exercises involving data measured on-ground and remotely-sensed imagery, and that the distinct error pattern of each type of measurement error can be used to identify the major error source. Based on this analysis, we can adjust the plot design or adjust the resolution of imagery, and select the optimal analytical method to achieve the best mapping result."
Optimization of Stereo-matching Algorithms Using Existing DEM Data,"Milledge, D.G.; Lane, S.N.; Warburton, J.",pp. 323-333(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000003/art00007;jsessionid=um2n7xqfpfkk.x-ic-live-01,"Here we present a new method for using existing Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data to optimize performance of stereo-matching algorithms for digital topographic determination. We show that existing DEM data, even those of a poor quality (precision, resolution) can be used as a means of training stereo-matching algorithms to generate higher quality DEM data. Existing data are used to identify and to remove gross surface errors. We test the method using true vertical aerial imagery for a UK upland study site. Results demonstrate a dramatic improvement in data quality even where DEM data derived from topographic maps are adopted. Comparison with other methods suggests that using existingDEMdata improves error identification and correction significantly. Tests suggest that it is applicable to both archival and commissioned aerial imagery."
Comparison Between First Pulse and Last Pulse Laser Scanner Data in the Automatic Detection of Buildings,"Matikainen, Leena; Hyyppä, Juha; Kaartinen, Harri",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000002/art00001;jsessionid=3o740nf8h5heo.x-ic-live-02,"A comparison between first pulse and last pulse laser scanner data in building detection was carried out. The automatic building detection method included region-based segmentation of a laser scanner derived digital surface model and classification of the segments by using the laser scanner data and an aerial ortho-image. Visual and numerical quality evaluations showed that the correctness of the results improved when last pulse data were used instead of first pulse data. According to a pixel-based comparison with a building map, the improvement was about 8 percentage units. The number of classification errors in the surroundings of the buildings decreased as a result of less vegetation. The number of false detections also decreased. These improvements were clearly shown by a building-based quality evaluation, where the inner part and surrounding area of each reference building was investigated and the number of false detections was calculated. For many buildings, the last pulse data with smaller buildings also corresponded better to the reference map, which improved correctness. The completeness of the results decreased slightly (about 2 percentage units according to the pixel-based comparison). One reason for this was the smaller buildings in the last pulse data."
Multivariate Image Texture by Multivariate Variogram for Multispectral Image Classification,"Li, Peijun; Cheng, Tao; Guo, Jiancong",pp. 147-157(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000002/art00002;jsessionid=3o740nf8h5heo.x-ic-live-02,"Traditional image texture measure usually allows a texture description of a single band of the spectrum, characterizing the spatial variability of gray-level values within the single-band image. A problem with the approach while applied to multispectral images is that it only uses the texture information from selected bands. In this paper, we propose a new multivariate texture measure based on the multivariate vari-ogram. The multivariate texture is computed from all bands of a multispectral image, which characterizes the multivariate spatial autocorrelation among those bands. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed texture measure, the derived multivariate texture image is combined with the spectral data in image classification. The result is compared to classifications using spectral data alone and plus traditional texture images. A machine learning classifier based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is used for image classification. The experimental results demonstrate that the inclusion of multivariate texture information in multispectral image classification significantly improves the overall accuracy, with 5 to 13.5 percent of improvement, compared to the classification with spectral information alone. The results also show that when incorporated in image classification as an additional band, the multivariate texture results in high overall accuracy, which is comparable with or higher than the best results from the existing single-band and two-band texture measures, such as the variogram, cross variogram and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) based texture. Overall, the multivariate texture provides the useful spatial information for land-cover classification, which is different from the traditional single band texture. Moreover, it avoids the band selection procedure which is prerequisite to traditional texture computation and would help to achieve high accuracy in the most classification tasks."
A Comparison of Individual Tree and Forest Plot Height Derived from Lidar and InSAR,"Huang, Shengli; Hager, Stacey A.; Halligan, Kerry Q.; Fairweather, Ian S.; Swanson, Alan K.; Crabtree, Robert L.",pp. 159-167(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000002/art00003;jsessionid=3o740nf8h5heo.x-ic-live-02,"To compare the capability and the accuracy of Light Detection And Ranging (lidar) and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (INSAR) for the detection and measurement of individual tree heights and forest plot heights, one lidar dataset with nominal spacing of 3 m and one short-wavelength Ku-band INSAR with comparable ground resolution of 3 m were studied. Vegetation heights were based on the subtraction between the bare ground Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and the canopy Digital Surface Models (DSMs). Two field measurement datasets of isolated individual trees and forest plots were used for validation. Results showed 78 percent and 17 percent of the individual trees was detected on lidar and INSAR data, respectively. General canopy height patterns could be successfully identified through a transect profile for both sensors, however, both sensors consistently underestimated vegetation height. Higher accuracy was obtained for both individual tree level and forest plot level with lidar than that from the Ku-band INSAR. These results indicate that lidar is much better than INSAR for the detection and estimation of tree and forest plot height."

Pre-visible Detection of Grub Feeding in Turfgrass using Remote Sensing,"Hamilton, Randy M.; Foster, Rick E.; Gibb, Timothy J.; Johannsen, Christian J.; Santini, Judith B.",pp. 179-192(14),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000002/art00005;jsessionid=3o740nf8h5heo.x-ic-live-02,"Japanese beetle grubs (Popillia japonica Newman) are root-feeding pests of turfgrass in the Midwest and eastern United States causing millions of dollars of damage annually. To reduce unnecessary pesticide output by applying only where needed, turfgrass managers need a practical, noninvasive method to locate patchy infestations before unsightly damage has occurred. Spectrometer data and multispectral aerial imagery were evaluated for detecting pre-visible symptoms of grub damage in turfgrass, to facilitate site-specific grub management. Using spectrometer reflectance data, first derivatives of reflectance, narrow-band vegetation indices, and linear combinations of multiple bands/indices, infested turfgrass plots were distinguished from un-infested plots 10 to16 days before visual differences appeared in the year when visual ratings were conducted. Pre-visible symptoms of grub feeding were not detected using the position of the red edge or edge of the red edge. Results using multi-spectral imagery were mixed, with early symptoms detected in only one of two years."
A Radiometric Aerial Triangulation for the Equalization of Digital Aerial Images and Orthoimages,"Chandelier, Laure; Martinoty, Gilles",pp. 193-200(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000002/art00006;jsessionid=3o740nf8h5heo.x-ic-live-02,"Atmospheric haze variations, temporal differences, atmosphere,’s or ground surfaces’ and Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), are well-known sources of radiometric heterogeneities in aerial images. It is necessary to correct them for many applications, such as the generation of large seamless mosaics of orthoimages, or land-cover classifications. This contribution describes a method for equalizing digital aerial images based on a parametric, semiempirical radiometric model. The model’s parameters are computed through a global least-squares minimization process, using radiometric tie-points in overlapping areas between images. The method may be called a “radiometric aerial triangulation” since its principle is quite similar to a standard aerial triangulation. It leads to a relative equalization between images, keeping their original contrast and color information. The method has been successfully applied operationally to more than forty projects comprising three to four thousands digital images each, for the creation of orthoimages over France. The results are good as long as atmospheric conditions are favorable and stable."
A Robust Approach for Repairing Color Composite DMC Images,"Pan, Jun; Wang, Mi; Li, Deren; Li, Jonathan",pp. 201-210(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2009/00000075/00000002/art00007;jsessionid=3o740nf8h5heo.x-ic-live-02,"The aerial images acquired by Intergraph’s Digital Mapping Camera (DMC) have been normally used for generating photogrammetric products such as Digital Terrain Models (DTM) and orthophotos. Our experience shows that the failure of radiometric correction in postprocessing leads to residual radiometric differences between CCD images, which then affect the quality of the images for further applications. This paper presents a robust approach to repair defects due to the residual radiometric differences. The approach comprises the autolocating for the transition area and seamline, and the subsequent reconstruction for image in radiometry. A hierarchical strategy for auto-locating is employed to reinforce the robustness, and a multi-scale strategy is adopted to optimize the adjustment in order to reduce the effect of the change of features in image during the subsequent reconstruction in radiometry. Experiments are designed for the validation of the proposed algorithm, in which both qualitative and quantitative analyses are applied to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. The algorithm has been embedded into GeoDodging 4.0 software package (Wuda Geoinformatics Co., Ltd., China), which is specialized in image dodging and mosaicking, as a complementary module for the postprocessing of DMC images."

We estimated an FSH map in a 60 m × 60 m plot by both photo estimation and field measurement, and set the unit area for FSH averaging at 10 m × 10 m. The root mean square of the differences between the mean photo-estimated and mean field-measured FSH was 3.8 m, which was revised to 1.9 m when the forest gaps were extracted offline. These differences were within a reasonably practical range since the range of the mean field-measured FSH was 10.0 to 21.4 m."

It was found that vegetation indices, especially the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from leaf-off (winter) images were significantly correlated with percent understory bamboo cover for both deciduous and mixed coniferous/deciduous forests. Winter NDVI was used to map bamboo coverage using a binary decision tree classifier. A high mapping accuracy for understory bamboo presence/absence was achieved with an overall accuracy of 89 percent (k = 0.59). In addition, for the first time, we successfully classified three density classes of bamboo with an overall accuracy of 68 percent (k = 0.48). These results were compared to three traditional multispectral bands-based methods (Mahalanobis distance, maximum likelihood, and artificial neural networks). The highest mapping accuracy was again obtained from winter images. However, the kappa z-test showed that there was no statistical difference in accuracy between the methods. The results suggest that winter is the optimal season for quantifying the coverage of evergreen understory bamboos in a mixed forest area, regardless of the classification methods use."

However, theoretical reasons for these correlations have not been accounted for. This paper introduces approximation theory adapted from computational science as a new framework to assess the accuracy of DEMs interpolated from topographic maps. By perceiving DEM generation as a piecewise polynomial simulation of the unknown terrain, the overall accuracy of a DEM is described by the maximum error at any DEM point. Three linear polynomial interpolation methods are examined, namely linear interpolation in 1D, TIN interpolation, and bilinear interpolation in a rectangle. Their propagation error and interpolation error, whose sum is the total error at a DEM point, are derived. Based on the results, the theoretical basis for the correlation between DEM error and terrain morphology and source data density is articulated for the first time."

The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using a soil moisture reflectance model, calibrated for an in situ measured Albic Luvisol dataset. Synthetic mixtures, i.e., compiled from in situ measured hyperspectral bare soil and citrus tree canopy spectra, were decomposed and the sub-pixel crop cover fractions (R2>0.94, RMSE<0.03) and pure vegetation signals (average extraction error 350 to 2,500 nm=0.017, RMSE=0.02) were adequately extracted from the mixtures."

A new production of CDED in the North is currently carried out by the Centre for Topographic Information, Natural Resources Canada with the support of the Canadian Space Agency. Approximately 1,500 new data sets are being produced. Altimetric data is partly acquired with the European Remote Sensing satellite (ERS) by interferometry (70 percent) and partly by stereo-compilation with aerial photography (30 percent). The assessment of the absolute altimetric accuracy of the CDEDs themselves as opposed from the sources is required. ICESAT lidar data gives us such an opportunity. The results obtained on the first CDED data sets produced with ERS interferometry are very promising. Accuracy for a group of 21 CDED is in the order of 0.34 m±6.22 m, i.e., 10 m at 90 percent confidence level. Accuracy is recorded in the metadata of each data set and is freely available on the GEOBASE portal(http://www.geobase.ca/)."

In average, a vertical accuracy of σh=13 cm or 0.20 per thousand of the mean flying height above mean terrain has been achieved. Some recent innovations in digital large-frame cameras and in the processing software give hope for even better results. In comparison with results from film-based cameras, it can be stated that both technologies are able to produce very dense and accurate DEMs."

Problems include the difficulty in discriminating between trees and grass, the misclassification of buildings due to diverse roof compositions and shadow effects, and the misclassification of cars on roads. Recently, lidar (light detection and ranging) data have been integrated with remotely sensed data to obtain better classification results. In this study, we first conducted maximum likelihood classification (MLC) experiments, a traditional pixelbased classification method, to identify features suitable for urban classification using lidar data and aerial imagery. The addition of lidar height data improved the overall accuracy by up to 28 and 18 percent, respectively, compared to cases with only red-green-blue (RGB) and multispectral imagery. To further improve classification, we propose a knowledgebased classification system (KBCS) that includes a three-level height, “asphalt road, vegetation, and non-vegetation” (A-V-N) classification rule-based scheme and knowledgebased correction (KBC). The proposed KBCS improved overall accuracy by 12 and 7 percent compared to maximum likelihood and object-based classification, respectively."

In the study, linearity, dynamic range, sensitivity, and absOlute calibration were evaluated. The results demonstrated the high radiometric quality of the sensors tested. All the sensors were linear in response. The DMC used the 12-bit dynamic range entirely, while the ADS40 and the UltraCamD indicated close to the 13-bit dynamic range. The sensors performed quite differently with respect to sensitivity. With the DMC and the UltraCamD a risk of overexposure appeared, while the color channels of the ADS40 showed low sensitivity. Because the sensors were linear in response, they could be absolutely calibrated using linear models."

However, it is often difficult or costly to acquire sufficient number of such velocity control points for the model calibration. This paper introduces ice flow stripes as alternative control points for the calibration of interferometric SAR data. Acquisition of this type of flow direction control points is relatively easy and inexpensive. We have derived the observation equations for the flow direction control points and formulated the least squares adjustment problem for calibrating the surface displace measurements respectively derived from the conventional interferometric method and speckle tracking method. Our experiments with Radarsat interferometric SAR data in Antarctica demonstrate that the exploitation of ice flow stripes as control points are effective, practical, and economical."

By recognizing the possibility of gradations of error, fuzzy sets can be used to assess errors due to class similarity, or the sensitivity of the map legend to class boundaries. Building on the theoretical work of Gopal and Woodcock (1994), we present a practical methodology for assessing map errors using fuzzy sets. A key component of our methodology focuses on improving the decision-making process map experts assume when conducting a fuzzy set assessment of map errors. Using an ecological context to define varying levels of land-cover class similarity, we demonstrate how a decision framework guides the map experts’ decisions and provides a more meaningful assessment of map errors. Our methodology differs from traditional fuzzy set error assessment methods in that the map expert evaluates misclassifications within the error matrix (off-diagonal cells) rather than individual reference sites. Advantages to a matrixbased approach include a reduction in the time required by map experts to evaluate map errors, and a relatively simple means of conveying map error information to the map user. We conclude that establishing criteria for determining multiple set memberships in a fuzzy set error assessment is an important methodological procedure that is commonly overlooked. Our methodology, designed to explicitly identify land-cover class similarities based on ecological criteria, serves as a practical example of how to address this issue."
Line Feature Correspondence between Object Space and Image Space,"Jaw, Jen-Jer; Perny, Nei-Hao",pp. 1521-1528(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000012/art00005;jsessionid=2p20j7gpnk7w4.x-ic-live-03,"In recent years, linear features have been gradually integrated into photogrammetry-related applications to estimate orientation parameters and facilitate object reconstruction, to name just a few. Yet, the correspondence of the conjugate linear features between different spaces or coordinate systems remains crucial to the goal of photogrammetric automation. When establishing exterior orientation of images on the line feature basis, the identifications and measurements of control line features must be involved. In this study, the authors develop an approach for effectively matching line features between object space and image space. The proposed algorithms start from projecting 3D line features into 2D image space employing collinearity equations with approximate orientation parameters. Then, the candidate lines detected from the images are chosen and matched with the 3D line features by imposing, in a sequential manner, geometric constraints that include angle, distance, reference point, and imaging geometry checks. Furthermore, a two-stage matching strategy, where the outcome of the first matching stage by partial 3D line features provides confined matching candidates for the second matching stage, is found effective in lowering the computational load, especially when faced with a great amount of 3D line features. Preliminary tests demonstrate successful, as well as satisfactory, 3D to 2D line feature correspondences using the proposed approach and strategy."
Modeling Algorithm-induced Errors in Iterative Mono-plotting Process,"Sheng, Yongwei",pp. 1529-1537(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000012/art00006;jsessionid=2p20j7gpnk7w4.x-ic-live-03,"Mono-plotting from a single photo is an efficient method to 3D spatial information collection. The core of the monoplotting process is an algorithm to determine the ground coordinates of pixel points in a single image by intersecting the view ray with the DEM-defined surface. A traditional algorithm used in photogrammetry is to iteratively calculate the coordinates based on the inverse collinearity equations. Being an iterative method, this algorithm may induce errors to the derived coordinates. When the iteration precision (the distance between the last two iterated points) becomes less than a predefined precision threshold, the iteration is considered convergent and the ground coordinates are produced. However, the true error of the output coordinates may be still worse than the threshold. This paper theoretically investigates the error budget of the iterative algorithm, models the true error from the iteration precision, and estimates the algorithm- induced error in the ground coordinate output."

A number of transition rules are introduced in the cellular automata model to consider the most influential urbanization factors, such as land-cover maps obtained from satellite images and population density from the census. The transition rules are calibrated both spatially and temporally to ensure the modeling accuracy. Spatially, each township (about 6 miles × 6 miles) in the study area is used as a calibration unit such that the spatial variability of the urban growth process can be taken into account. The temporal calibration is performed by using a sequence of remote sensing images from which the land-cover information at different years is extracted. As for the assessment, fitness (for urban level match) and two types of modeling errors (for urban pattern match) are introduced as the evaluation criteria. The study shows that the use of images reduces the need for a large number of input data. Evaluation on the rule variogram reveals that the transition rule values are correlated spatially and vary with the urbanization level. The paper reports the study outcome over the city of Indianapolis, Indiana for the past three decades using Landsat images and the population data."

Every application needs a certain geometric accuracy in the corrected image; therefore, the planimetric accuracy control of VHR satellite imagery proves to be fundamental. As a rule of thumb, the Root Mean Square error (RMS) computed at independent check points (ICPs) is the global measure most widely used for accuracy assessment in VHR imagery. This paper presents an assessment, focused on two QuickBird and Ikonos panchromatic single images, of the number of ICPs required to obtain an estimation of one-dimensional accuracy (RMS1d) with a certain confidence level or reliability. Thus, two theoretical approaches have been tested to estimate reliability depending on the number of ICPs, and they have been experimentally validated using the Monte Carlo simulation method. The residual’s samples were generated for both satellite images in the best possible operational conditions: (a) using optimal sensor models, (b) with high accuracy ground points measured by Differential Global Positioning System, (c) with an adequate number of well distributed ground control points (GCPs), and (d) using GCPs and ICPs well-defined on the raw images, i.e., with a reasonably low pointing error. Under these conditions, the two theoretical models tested provided a good fit (r2> 97 percent) for the simulated data offered by Monte Carlo when outliers were withdrawn. There were no notable differences between the results obtained from the Ikonos and QuickBird scenes."
"Designing a Multi-Objective, Multi-Support Accuracy Assessment of the 2001 National Land Cover Data (NLCD 2001) of the Conterminous United States","Stehman, Stephen V.; Wickham, James D.; Wade, Timothy G.; Smith, Jonathan H.",pp. 1561-1571(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000012/art00009;jsessionid=2p20j7gpnk7w4.x-ic-live-03,"The database design and diverse application of NLCD 2001 pose significant challenges for accuracy assessment because numerous objectives are of interest, including accuracy of land-cover, percent urban imperviousness, percent tree canopy, land-cover composition, and net change. A multisupport approach is needed because these objectives require spatial units of different sizes for reference data collection and analysis. Determining a sampling design that meets the full suite of desirable objectives for the NLCD 2001 accuracy assessment requires reconciling potentially conflicting design features that arise from targeting the different objectives. Multi-stage cluster sampling provides the general structure to achieve a multi-support assessment, and the flexibility to target different objectives at different stages of the design. We describe the implementation of two-stage cluster sampling for the initial phase of the NLCD 2001 assessment, and identify gaps in existing knowledge where research is needed to allow full implementation of a multi-objective, multi-support assessment."
Fuzzy ARTMAP Based Neurocomputational Spatial Uncertainty Measures,"Li, Zhe",pp. 1573-1584(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000012/art00010;jsessionid=2p20j7gpnk7w4.x-ic-live-03,"This paper proposes non-parametric measures for the fuzzy ARTMAP computational neural network to handle spatial uncertainty in remotely sensed imagery classification, i.e., ART Commitment (ART-C) and ART Typicality (ART-T), expressing in the first case the degree of commitment a classifier has for each class for a specific pixel, and in the second case, how typical that pixel’s reflectances are of the ones upon which the classifier was trained for each class. Results from case studies were compared against the previously developed SOM Commitment (SOM-C) and SOM Typicality (SOM-T) classifiers as well as conventional Bayesian posterior probability and Mahalanobis typicality soft classifiers. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was used to explore the relationship between these different measures. Results indicate that ART-C and SOM-C measures express values similar to Bayesian posterior probabilies, and ART-T and SOM-T are closely related to Mahalanobis typicalities. However, the proposed neural approaches outperform the traditional methods due to their non-parametric advantage."
Classification of Very High Spatial Resolution Imagery Based on the Fusion of Edge and Multispectral Information,"Huang, Xin; Zhang, Liangpei; Li, Pingxiang",pp. 1585-1596(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000012/art00011;jsessionid=2p20j7gpnk7w4.x-ic-live-03,"A new algorithm based on the fusion of edge and multispectral information is proposed for the pixel-wise classification of very high-resolution (VHR) remotely sensed imagery. It integrates the multispectral, spatial and structural information existing in the image. The edge feature is first extracted using an improved multispectral edge detection method, which takes into account the original multispectral bands, the linear NDVI, and the independent spectral components extracted by independent component analysis (ICA). Direction-lines are then defined using the edge and multispectral information. Two effective spatial measures are calculated based on the direction-lines in order to describe the contextual information and strengthen the multispectral feature space. Then, the support vector machine (SVM) is employed to classify the hybrid structural-multispectral feature set. In experiments, the proposed spatial measures were compared with the pixel shape index (PSI) and the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs well in terms of classification accuracies and visual interpretation."
Habitat Mapping in Rugged Terrain Using Multispectral Ikonos Images,"Nichol, Janet; Wong, Man Sing",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000011/art00001;jsessionid=4qamvfch3burv.x-ic-live-01,"Due to the significant time and cost requirements of traditional mapping techniques, accurate and detailed habitat maps for large areas are uncommon. This study investigates the application of Ikonos Very High Resolution (VHR) images to habitat mapping in the rugged terrain of Hong Kong’s country parks. A required mapping scale of 1:10 000, a minimum map object size of 150 m2 on the ground, and a minimum accuracy level of 80 percent were set as the mapping standards. Very high quality aerial photographs and digital topographic maps provided accurate reference data for the image processing and habitat classification. A comparison between manual stereoscopic aerial photographic interpretation and image classification using pixel-based and object-based classifiers was carried out. The Multi-level Object Oriented Segmentation with Decision Tree Classification (MOOSC) was devised during this study using a suite of image processing techniques to integrate spectral, textural, and spatial criteria with ancillary data. Manual mapping from air photos combined with fieldwork obtained the best result, with 95 percent overall accuracy, but both this and the MOOSC method, with 94 percent, easily met the 80 percent specified accuracy standard. The MOOSC method was able to achieve similar accuracy aerial photographs, but at only one third of the cost."
Estimation of Forest Stand Characteristics Using Spectral Histograms Derived from an Ikonos Satellite Image,"Peuhkurinen, Jussi; Maltamo, Matti; Vesa, Lauri; Packalén, Petteri",pp. 1335-1341(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000011/art00002;jsessionid=4qamvfch3burv.x-ic-live-01,"The aim of this paper was to examine the potential of Ikonos satellite images for estimating boreal forest stand characteristics using frequency distributions of radiometric values. The spectral features selected for use in the estimation were medians, standard deviations, and the parameters of the two-parametric Weibull distribution derived from the standwise spectral histograms of the Ikonos image. Ancillary map information, such as land-use and peatland classes, was also included. The method of estimation was nonparametric k-most similar neighbors (K-MSN) method. The most accurate results were achieved using spectral features that were derived from the multispectral images. The lowest RMSEs for the mean total stem volume, basal area, and mean height were 52.2 m3/ha (31.3 percent), 5.6 m2/ha (25.3 percent), and 3.1 m (20.6 percent), respectively. When only the panchromatic image was used in the analysis, the RMSEs for the mean total stem volume and basal area were about 3 percentage points higher. No differences in the mean height estimates were observed between the multispectral and panchromatic images. The most efficient predictor variables were the medians and the scale parameters of the Weibull distribution. The use of classified map information did not improve the results. The findings suggest that Ikonos satellite images can be used in to estimate forest stand characteristics giving an accuracy that corresponds to that achieved with aerial photographs."
Pixel-based Minnaert Correction Method for Reducing Topographic Effects on a Landsat 7 ETM+ Image,"Ge, Hongli; Lu, Dengsheng; He, Shizhen; Xu, Aijun; Zhou, Guomo; Du, Huaqiang",pp. 1343-1350(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000011/art00003;jsessionid=4qamvfch3burv.x-ic-live-01,"The topographic effect on land surface reflectance is an important factor affecting quantitative analysis of remotely sensed data in mountainous regions. Different approaches have been developed to reduce topographical effects. Of the many methods, the Minnaert correction method is most frequently used for topographic correction, but a single global Minnaert value used in previous research cannot effectively reduce topographic effects on the remotely sensed data, especially in the areas with steep slopes. This paper explores the method to develop a pixel-based Minnaert coefficient image based on the established relationship between Minnaert coefficients and topographic slopes. A texture measure based on homogeneity is used to eva-luate the topographic correction result. This study has demonstrated promising in reducing topographic effects on the Landsat ETM+ image with the pixel-based Minnnaert correction method."
Orthogonal Transformation of Segmented SPOT5 Images,"Ivits, Eva; Lamb, Alistair; Langar, Filip; Hemphill, Scott; Koch, Barbara",pp. 1351-1364(14),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000011/art00004;jsessionid=4qamvfch3burv.x-ic-live-01,"Brightness, Greenness, and Wetness Tasselled Cap parameters were derived for the SPOT5 sensor. Their robustness through space and time and their discrimination power in land-cover classes was investigated. Four images were acquired from March and September 2003, and in July and November 2004 over Germany. A fifth SPOT5 image was acquired from Cameroon, West Africa in January 2003. The Tasselled Cap parameters were extracted with the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization technique for each image independently. One set of combined parameters was created for Germany using samples from the four SPOT5 images simultaneously. Each SPOT5 image was transformed into Brightness, Greenness, and Wetness with their own with the combined and the July parameters. Spearman’s Rho correlation analysis was carried out between the Tasselled Cap counterparts acquired with the various parameters. Brightness exhibited nearly perfect correlations between the images in Germany; in Cameroon however, the images were inconsistent. Greenness and Wetness displayed a difference of up to 35 percent in November in Germany. The Wetness counterparts in Cameroon exhibited a 7 percent difference. Canonical discrimination analysis revealed that the components from July had the highest discrimination power and that Greenness expressed the highest association to the first canonical axis in all images. In March, July, and November, Brightness was the second most important Tasselled Cap component, in September the Wetness and in Cameroon the Greenness. These results indicate that the Tasselled Cap components are not stable between different seasons and geographical locations. They can be successfully used for land-cover discrimination if the images are transformed with parameters appropriate to the investigated season respective biogeographical zone."
A Polygonal Approach for Automation in Extraction of Serial Modular Roofs,"Avrahami, Yair; Raizman, Yuri; Doytsher, Yerach",pp. 1365-1378(14),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000011/art00005;jsessionid=4qamvfch3burv.x-ic-live-01,"This paper presents a novel approach for automation in roof extraction from two solved aerial images. The approach assumes that roofs are composed of several spatial polygons, and that they can be obtained by extracting all or even only some of them if the model is known. In view of this assumption, innovative algorithms for semi-automatic spatial polygon extraction were developed. These algorithms are based on a 2D approach to solving the 3D reality. Based on these algorithms, an interactive and semi-automatic modelbased approach for automation in roof extraction was developed. The approach is composed of two phases: manual (interactive) and automatic. In the manual (interactive) phase, the operator needs to choose an Expanded Parameterized Model (EPM) from a knowledge base and select one pre-prepared Interactive Option for Extraction (IOE) of the roof. Then, the operator needs to point according to the guidelines of the chosen option in the left image space. In the automatic phase, the selected spatial polygons are extracted, the parameters of the selected model are calculated and the roof is reconstructed. The approach was examined and the results we obtained had standard accuracy. It appears that the approach can be implemented on many types of roofs and under diverse photographic conditions. In this paper, the algorithms, the experiments and the results are detailed."

Leaf Area Index (LAI) Change Detection Analysis on Loblolly Pine (Pinus taeda) Following Complete Understory Removal,"Iiames, J.S.; Congalton, R.G.; Pilant, A.N.; Lewis, T.E.",pp. 1389-1400(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000011/art00007;jsessionid=4qamvfch3burv.x-ic-live-01,"The confounding effect of understory vegetation contributions to satellite-derived estimates of leaf area index (LAI) was investigated on two loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) forest stands located in Virginia and North Carolina. In order to separate NDVI contributions of the dominant-codominate crown class from that of the understory, twoP.taeda 1 ha plots centered in planted stands of ages 19 and 23 years with similar crown closures (71 percent) were analyzed for in situ LAI and NDVI differences following a complete understory removal at the peak period of LAI. Understory vegetation was removed from both stands using mechanical harvest and herbicide application in late July and early August 2002. Ikonos data was acquired both prior and subsequent to understory removal and were evaluated for NDVI response. Total vegetative biomass removed under the canopies was estimated using the Tracing Radiation and Architecture of Canopies (TRAC) instrument combined with digital hemispherical photography (DHP). Within-image NDVI change detection analysis (CDA) on the Virginia site showed that the percentage of removed understory (LAI) detected by the Ikonos sensor was 5.0 percent when compared to an actual in situ LAI reduction of 10.0 percent. The North Carolina site results showed a smaller percentage of reduced understory LAI detected by the Ikonos sensor (1.8 percent) when compared to the actual LAI reduction as measured in situ (17.4 percent). Image-to-image NDVI CDA proved problematic due to the time period between the Ikonos image collections (2.5 to 3 months). Sensor and solar position differences between the two collections, along with pine LAI increases through multiple needle flush, exaggerated NDVI reductions when compared to in situ data."
An Initial Study on Vehicle Information Extraction from Single Pass QuickBird Satellite Imagery,"Xiong, Zhen; Zhang, Yun",pp. 1401-1411(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000011/art00008;jsessionid=4qamvfch3burv.x-ic-live-01,"Vehicle information is useful in many fields. In this paper, a technique is presented to extract vehicle information from single pass QuickBird images. While passing a target area, the satellite acquires panchromatic (PAN) and multi-spectral (MS) images simultaneously. Because of a small time interval difference between the PAN andMSimages, it is theoretically possible to extract two sets of vehicle ground positions from the PAN and MS images, respectively, to identify whether or not a vehicle is in motion, and to calculate the vehicle’;s velocity and direction. Practically, however, this extraction and calculation are challenging. Since the time interval is very short, a small error in information extraction will result in an unacceptably large error in the calculated vehicle position and velocity. Another challenge is that satellite image pairs (PAN and MS) do not have the same resolution. Therefore, traditional change detection techniques are incapable of providing reliable results, due to varying scales and relief distortions in the co-registered images or slight pixel shifts in the orthorectified images caused by resampling of the PAN and MS images. In order to avoid these errors, this research presents an algorithm through which a vehicle’s ground positions can be directly calculated from the raw PAN and MS images. Experiments demonstrate that it is feasible to use this technique to extract vehicle information from high-resolution images obtained from a single satellite pass."

Three agriculturally intensive study areas within the midsection of the United States were analyzed during the peak of their growing season. For each region the data were collected within the same hour during August 2005. Identical decision tree style classification methodologies relying on ground truth from the June Agricultural Survey were applied to the image pairs for each of the three cases. The direct comparison of mapping accuracy results show, on average, the TM output to perform slightly better than that of the complimentary AWIFS. It is concluded AWIFS is a valid alternative to TM for classifying cultivated agriculture in areas with reasonably large field sizes. Furthermore, AWIFS offers increased benefits due to larger swath widths and shorter revisit frequencies."
Using a Binary Space Partitioning Tree for Reconstructing Polyhedral Building Models from Airborne Lidar Data,"Sohn, Gunho; Huang, Xianfeng; Tao, Vincent",pp. 1425-1438(14),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000011/art00010;jsessionid=4qamvfch3burv.x-ic-live-01,"During the past several years, point density covering topographic objects with airborne lidar (Light Detection And Ranging) technology has been greatly improved. This achievement provides an improved ability for reconstructing more complicated building roof structures; more specifically, those comprising various model primitives horizontally and/or vertically. However, the technology for automatically reconstructing such a complicated structure is thus far poorly understood and is currently based on employing a limited number of pre-specified building primitives. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a new technique of modeling 3D building objects using a data-driven approach whereby densely collecting low-level modeling cues from lidar data are used in the modeling process. The core of the proposed method is to globally reconstruct geometric topology between adjacent linear features by adopting a BSP (Binary Space Partitioning) tree. The proposed algorithm consists of four steps: (a) detecting individual buildings from lidar data, (b) clustering laser points by height and planar similarity, (c) extracting rectilinear lines, and (d) planar partitioning and merging for the generation of polyhedral models. This paper demonstrates the efficacy of the algorithm for creating complex models of building rooftops in 3D space from airborne lidar data."

Multitemporal Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper-plus (ETM+) imagery is used to assess the performance of three Artificial Neural Networks – Multi-Layer Perceptron, ARTMAP, Self-Organizing Map, and two Classification Tree splitting algorithms: gini and entropy rules. MLA performance evaluations are based on susceptibility to reduced training set size, noise, and variations in the training set, as well as the operability/transparency of the classification process. Classification trees produced the most accurate selective logging maps (gini and entropy rule decision tree mean overall map accuracy = 94 percent and mean per-class kappa of 0.59 and 0.60, respectively). Classification trees are shown to be more robust and accurate when faced with deficient training data, regardless of splitting rule. Of the neural network algorithms, self-organizing maps were least sensitive to the introduction of noise and variations in training data. Given their robust classification capabilities and transparency of the class-selection process, classification trees are preferable algorithms for mapping selective logging and have potential in other forest monitoring applications."

Three different band combinations (reflectance, tasseled cap, and both reflectance and tasseled cap plus thermal) were compared for their effectiveness with each of the methods. Thirty different training site number and size combinations were also tested. Support vector regression on the tasseled cap bands was found to be the best estimator for urban forest canopy cover, while Cubist performed best using the reflectance plus tasseled cap band combination when predicting impervious surface cover. More training data partitioned in many small training sites generally produces better estimation results."

Our purpose is to introduce GP models into the remote sensing community for supervised learning as exemplified in this study for classifying hyperspectral images. We first provided the mathematical formulation of GP models concerning both regression and classification; described several GP classifiers (GPCLs) and the automatic learning of kernel parameters; and then, examined the effectiveness of GPCLs compared with K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Experiment results on an Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectroradiometer image indicate that the GPCLs outperform KNN and yield classification accuracies comparable to or even better than SVMs. This study shows that GP models, though with a larger computation scaling than SVM, bring a competitive tool for remote sensing applications related to classification or possibly regression, particularly with small or moderate sizes of training datasets."

A geovisualization tool was developed to facilitate knowledge discovery and understanding of the hyperspectral image. A case study was conducted using a Hyperion image. The results obtained from the improved neuro-fuzzy system were found to be significantly better than those from conventional statistics-based and endmember-based classifiers. The fuzzy spectral profiles produced from the geovisualization tool provided an extra insight into the neuro-fuzzy learning process, further opening up the black box of the neural network."

This has significant economic and environmental advantages for improved agricultural practices that are essential given forecast increases in global population and food production needs. In this study, a new hybrid segmentation - Artificial Neural Network (HS-ANN) method was compared to standard Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) for improving crop/weed species discrimination in SSHM/PA. Very high spatial resolution (1.25 mm) ground-based hyperspectral image data were acquired over field plots of canola, pea, and wheat crops seeded with two weed species (redroot pigweed, wild oat) in southern Alberta, Canada. The very high spatial and spectral resolution image data required development of a simple yet efficient vegetation index (Modified Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index (MCARI)) threshold segmentation to separate vegetation from soil for classification. The HSANN consistently outperformed MLC in both single date and multi-temporal classifications. Higher class accuracies were obtained with multi-temporally trained ANNs (84 to 92 percent overall), with improvements up to 31 percent over MLC. With advancements in imaging technology and computer processing speed, this HS-ANN method may constitute a viable farm option for real-time detection and mapping of weed species for SSHM in agriculture."

The results show that the genetic algorithm is the only method able to discover a significantly better neural network structure. The main drawback of the genetic approach is the extensive training time required."

The cellular automata model is designed as a function of multitemporal satellite imagery and population density. Transition rules in the model identify the required neighborhood urbanization level for a test pixel to develop to urban. Calibration of the model is initially performed by exhaustive search, where the entire solution space is examined to find the best set of rule values. This method is computationally extensive and needs to consider all possible combinations for the transition rules. The rise in the number of variables will exponentially increase the time required for running and calibrating the model. This study introduces genetic algorithms as an effective solution to the calibration problem. It is shown that the genetic algorithms are able to produce modeling results close to the ones obtained from the exhaustive search in a time effective manner. Optimal rule values can be reached within the early generations of genetic algorithms. It is expected that genetic algorithms will significantly benefit urban modeling problems with larger set of input data and bigger solution spaces."
High Resolution Elevation Data Derived from Stereoscopic CORONA Imagery with Minimal Ground Control,"Galiatsatos, Nikolaos; Donoghue, Daniel N.M.; Philip, Graham",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000009/art00001;jsessionid=1vw1bfluupqvk.x-ic-live-03,"The first space mission to provide stereoscopic imagery of the Earth’s surface was from the American CORONA spy satellite program from which it is possible to generate Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). CORONA imagery and derived DEMs are of most value in areas where conventional topographic maps are of poor quality, but the problem has been that until recently, it was difficult to assess their accuracy. This paper presents a methodology to create a high quality DEM from CORONA imagery using horizontal ground control derived from Ikonos space imagery and vertical ground control from map-based contour lines. Such DEMs can be produced without the need for field-based ground control measurements which is an advantage in many parts of world where ground surveying is difficult. Knowledge of CORONA image distortions, satellite geometry, ground resolution, and film scanning are important factors that can affect the DEM extraction process. A study area in Syria is used to demonstrate the method, and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data is used to perform quantitative and qualitative accuracy assessment of the automatically extracted DEM. The SRTM data has enormous importance for validating the quality of CORONA DEMs, and so, unlocking the potential of a largely untapped part of the archive. We conclude that CORONA data can produce unbiased, high-resolution DEM data which may be valuable for researchers working in countries where topographic data is difficult to obtain."

The presented study aims at refining and improving the High-Pass Filter Additive (HPFA) fusion method towards a tunable and versatile, yet standardized image fusion tool. HPFA is an image fusion method in the spatial domain, which inserts structural and textural details of the higher resolution image into the lower resolution image, whose spectral properties are thereby largely retained. Using various input image pairs, workable sets of HPFA parameters have been derived with regard to high-pass filter properties and injection weights. Improvements are the standardization of the HPFA parameters over a wide range of image resolution ratios and the controlled trade-off between resulting image sharpness and spectral properties. The results are evaluated visually and by spectral and spatial metrics in comparison with wavelet-based image fusion results as a benchmark."
Photogrammetric Modeling of Linear Features with Generalized Point Photogrammetry,"Zhang, Zuxun; Zhang, Yongjun; Zhang, Jianging; Zhang, Hongwei",pp. 1119-1127(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000009/art00003;jsessionid=1vw1bfluupqvk.x-ic-live-03,"Most current digital photogrammetric workstations are based on feature points. Curved features are quite difficult to be modeled because they cannot be treated as feature points. The focus of the paper is on the photogrammetric modeling of space linear features. In general, lines and curves can be represented by a series of connected points, so called, generalized points in the paper. Different from all existing models, only one collinearity equation is used for each point on the linear curve, which makes the mathematical model very simple. Hereby, the key of generalized point photogrammetry is that all kinds of features are treated as generalized points to use either x or y collinearity equation. A significant difference between generalized point photogrammetry and conventional point photogrammetry is that image features are not necessarily exact conjugates. The exact conjugacy between image features and/or the correspondence between space and image feature are established during bundle block adjustment. Photogrammetric modeling of several space linear features is discussed. Sub-pixel precision has been achieved for both exterior orientation and 3D modeling of linear features, which verifies the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed approach."
A Photogrammetric Correction Procedure for Light Refraction Effects at a Two-Medium Boundary,"Murase, Toshimi; Tanaka, Miho; Tani, Tomomi; Miyashita, Yuko; Ohkawa, Naoto; Ishiguro, Satoshi; Suzuki, Yasuhiro; Kayanne, Hajime; Yamano, Hiroya",pp. 1129-1136(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000009/art00004;jsessionid=1vw1bfluupqvk.x-ic-live-03,"We report on a correction procedure for light refraction effects at a two-medium boundary, based on the stereo view of underwater objects, to estimate underwater topography using photogrammetry. Because theoretically, no solution exists for photogrammetrically observed positions when the incident angles of light rays from an underwater object of interest to two cameras are different; approximation in solving the positions is needed. We show the feasibility of the approximation theoretically by examining the horizontal differences between the observed and true positions when objects are in line along an airplane track or when the incident angles are identical. We applied the procedure to bathymetric mapping of Shiraho Reef, southwest Japan, using a stereo-pair of aerial photographs. Comparison of the corrected depths with measured depths at 658 points showed a mean error and standard deviation of 20.06 m and 0.36 m, respectively, for measured depth range of 23.4 m to 20.2 m."
Significance of Altitude and Posting Density on Lidar-derived Elevation Accuracy on Hazardous Waste Sites,"García-Quijano, María J.; Jensen, John.

Both missions provided adequate elevation estimates (low-altitude RMSEz6 cm; high-altitude RMSEz14 cm.) A quantitative comparison was performed to determine how decreasing platform altitude and increasing lidar posting density affected the vertical elevation accuracy. Higher posting densities did not significantly improve the vertical accuracy of lidar-derived elevation data. Conversely, acquiring the lidar-derived elevation data at a lower altitude had a significant influence on the mean vertical error present in the lidar-derived elevation data. Differences in mean vertical elevation error between the lowand high-altitude lidar data collection missions were primarily due to a systematic underestimation bias present in the high-altitude lidar data."
Shaping Polyhedral Buildings by the Fusion of Vector Maps and Lidar Point Clouds,"Chen, Liang-Chien; Teo, Tee-Ann; Kuo, Chih-Yi; Rau, Jiann-Yeou",pp. 1147-1157(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000009/art00006;jsessionid=1vw1bfluupqvk.x-ic-live-03,"We integrate lidar point clouds and large-scale vector maps to perform building modeling. The proposed scheme comprises three major steps: (a) the preprocessing of lidar point clouds and vector maps, (b) roof analysis, and (c) building reconstruction. During the preprocessing stage, the building polygons are first obtained from the polylines, followed by the selections of lidar points in the building polygons. An irregular triangulated network is then built to represent the facets. The segmentation of planar facets for roof analysis is implemented by examining the patch size and the facet orientation. The interior 3D roof edges are then determined from the intersection of the roof planes. Finally, the building models are reconstructed through regularization. Two sample sites are tested for the purposes of validation. The experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme allows for high fidelity and accuracy, provided that the point cloud density is enough."
Object-based Classification of High Resolution SAR Images for Within Field Homogeneous Zone Delineation,"Liu, Jiangui; Pattey, Elizabeth; Nolin, Michel C.",pp. 1159-1168(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000009/art00007;jsessionid=1vw1bfluupqvk.x-ic-live-03,"Delineating management zones is important in agriculture for implementing site-specific practices. We delineated within-field homogeneous zones over a corn and a wheat field using high spatial resolution multi-temporal airborne C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery with an object-based fuzzy k-means classification approach. Image objects were generated by a segmentation procedure implemented in eCognition®software, and were classified as basic processing units using SAR data. Results were evaluated using analysis of variance and variance reduction of soil electrical conductivity (EC), leaf area index (LAI), and crop yield. The object-based approach provided better results than a pixel-based approach. The variance reduction in LAI, and soil EC varied with SAR acquisition time and incidence angle. Although the variance reduction of yield was not as significant as that of LAI and EC, average yield among the delineated zones were different in most cases. The SAR data classification produced interpretable patterns of soil and crop spatial variability, which can be used to infer within-field management zones."
MODIS-based Change Detection for Grizzly Bear Habitat Mapping in Alberta,"Pape, Alysha D.; Franklin, Steven E.",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000008/art00001;jsessionid=545rcah5rke0o.x-ic-live-01,"Coarse resolution data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was used to test the effectiveness of 250 m data to detect forest disturbances and update an existing, large-area (150,000 km2), 30 m Landsat ETM+ and TM land-cover map product used in Grizzly Bear(Ursus arctos)habitat analysis. A Landsat-derived polygon layer was applied to the MOD13Q1 data product to create a polygon-based, mean NDVI time series (2000 to 2005). Image differencing of the dataset produced multiple-scale layers of change including a two-date, five-year change and a five-year composite of annual changes. Accuracy assessments based on available GIS data showed an overall accuracy as high as 59 percent. Results also show that disturbance patches larger than 15 ha were represented with an accuracy of 75 percent or higher. This offers an alternative to higher spatial resolution data for the identification of larger features and also provides general change information for those areas that may be suitable for analysis with higher spatial resolution data."
Quantitative Mapping of Hydrodynamic Vegetation Density of Floodplain Forests Under Leaf-off Conditions Using Airborne Laser Scanning,"Straatsma, Menno W.",pp. 987-998(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000008/art00002;jsessionid=545rcah5rke0o.x-ic-live-01,"In this paper a method is presented to extract hydrodynamic vegetation density from airborne laser scanner data, relevant for exceedance levels of embankments of lowland areas. Two indices to predict vegetation density from the laser data were considered: (a) Percentage Index (PI) of points in the height interval inundated by the water, and (b) the Vegetation Area Index (VAI) that corrects for occlusion from the crown area. A computer simulation, using a digital forest model, showed a sensitivity of the indices for laser pulses that were sent out, but not detected by the laser receiver. The locations of these invalid points were therefore reconstructed. Two different assumptions were tested to assign new coordinates to these so-called invalid points. Percentage Index, with the invalid points reconstructed by means of thresholding the point density ratio, proved the best predictor (R2=0.66) of vegetation density of deciduous floodplain forests under winter conditions."
Urban Change Detection Based on Coherence and Intensity Characteristics of SAR Imagery,"Liao, Mingsheng; Jiang, Liming; Lin, Hui; Huang, Bo; Gong, Jianya",pp. 999-1006(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000008/art00003;jsessionid=545rcah5rke0o.x-ic-live-01,"In this paper, an unsupervised change-detection approach was proposed to detect new urban areas from multi-temporal SAR images. The novelty of the proposed approach is the joint use of coherence and intensity characteristics of SAR imagery. The approach involves two main steps: (a) the extraction of difference feature containing information on changed areas, and (b) the unsupervised two-dimensional (2D) thresholding. First, two difference features based on the concepts of long-term coherence and backscattering temporal variability are extracted from a series of multi-temporal SAR images. Then, the resulting features that represent the INSAR signal temporal variability of changed areas are merged, and a 2D thresholding technique based on the maximum 2D Renyi’s entropy criterion is developed to obtain the change-detection results. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is confirmed with experimental results obtained from a set of six ERS-1/2 SLC SAR images acquired in Shanghai, China."
Factors Affecting Spatial Variation of Classification Uncertainty in an Image Object-based Vegetation Mapping,"Yu, Qian; Gong, Peng; Tian, Yong Q.; Pu, Ruiliang; Yang, Jun",pp. 1007-1018(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000008/art00004;jsessionid=545rcah5rke0o.x-ic-live-01,"Much effort has been spent on examining the spatial variation of classification accuracy and associated factors on a per-pixel basis. In the past few years, object-based classification has attracted growing interest. This paper examines factors affecting the spatial variation of classification uncertainty in an object-based vegetation mapping. We studied six categories of factors in an object-based classification: general membership, topography, sample object density, spatial composition, sample object reliability, and object features. First, classification uncertainty (classification accuracy on a per-case basis) is derived with a bootstrap method. Then, six categories of factors are quantified by categorical or continuous variables. In this step, the appropriate radius for calculating the spatial composition metrics of sample objects is also discussed. Finally, classification uncertainty is modeled as a function of those factors using a mixed linear model. The significant factors are identified and their parameters are estimated from restricted maximum likelihood fit. The modeling results show that elevation, sample object size, sample object reliability, sample object density, and sample spatial composition significantly influence the object-based classification uncertainty. Many of these factors are closely related to the object-based approach. The result of this study helps in understanding classification errors and suggests further improvement of the classification."

However, this wide choice means that it is difficult to know which solution to choose. A system capable of integrating the results of different analyses and applying them to land-cover mapping would therefore be extremely useful. This study investigates the use of evidence pooling and neural networks in land-cover mapping. Neural networks were used to classify land-cover using evidence from spectral (Landsat-7 ETM1), textural, and topographic information. Mapping was performed using combinations of evidence source and evidence pooling techniques. The best performance was achieved using all available information with a method that summed evidence directly instead of categorizing it. While the methodology failed to reach the level of accuracy recommended elsewhere, a comparison of the number of classes used with other methods showed that the system performed better than these approaches."
Lidar-based Mapping of Forest Volume and Biomass by Taxonomic Group Using Structurally Homogenous Segments,"van Aardt, Jan A.N.; Wynne, Randolph H.; Scrivani, John A.",pp. 1033-1044(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000008/art00006;jsessionid=545rcah5rke0o.x-ic-live-01,"This study evaluated the potential of an object-oriented approach to forest type classification as well as volume and biomass estimation using small-footprint, multiple return lidar data. The approach was applied to coniferous, deciduous, and mixed forest stands in the Virginia Piedmont, U.S.A. A multiresolution, hierarchical segmentation algorithm was applied to a canopy height model (CHM) to delineate objects ranging from 0.035 to 5.632 ha/average object. Per-object lidar point (per return height and intensity) and CHM distributional parameters were used as input to a discriminant classification of 2-class (deciduous-coniferous) and 3-class (deciduous-coniferous-mixed) forest definitions. Lidar point-height-based and CHM classifications yielded overall accuracies of 89 percent and 79 percent, respectively. Volume and biomass estimates exhibited differences of no more than 5.5 percent compared to field estimates, while showing distinctly improved precisions (up to 45.5 percent). There were no significant differences between accuracies for varying object sizes, which implies that reducing the lidar point coverage would not affect classification accuracy. These results lead to the conclusion that a lidar-based approach to forest type classification and volume/biomass assessment has the potential to serve as a single-source inventory tool."

There is, however, a lack of comparative analyses among these methods. This study compares three major spectral analysis techniques (regression modeling, regression tree, and normalized spectral mixture analysis (NSMA)) for continuous %ISA estimation using Landsat imagery for 1986 and 2002 for the seven-county Twin Cities Metropolitan Area of Minnesota. Our study showed that all three techniques demonstrate the capability for estimating %ISA accurately, withRMSEranging from 7.3 percent to 11 percent and R2of 0.90 to 0.96 for both years. Comparatively, regression modeling and regression tree methods produced similar results; however, both of them are highly dependent on accurate masks to differentiate urban impervious surfaces from bare soil. Within the urban mask, the regression tree-based estimates were the most accurate. In terms of time and cost, the NSMA approach is most efficient, but it tends to underestimate the percent imperviousness for highly developed areas. Findings from the study provide guidance for the selection of %ISA estimation techniques using moderate resolution remote sensing data, along with information for further methodological improvements."

The ISA data are essential for environmental monitoring and management in coastal State of Rhode Island. However, there is lack of information on high spatial resolution ISA. In this study, we developed an algorithm of multiple agent segmentation and classification (MASC) that includes submodels of segmentation, shadow-effect, MANOVA-based classification, and post-classification. The segmentation sub-model replaced the spectral difference with heterogeneity change for regions merging. Shape information was introduced to enhance the performance of ISA extraction. The shadow-effect sub-model used a split-and-merge process to separate shadows and the objects that cause the shadows. The MANOVA-based classification sub-model took into account the relationship between spectral bands and the variability in the training objects and the objects to be classified. Existing GIS data were used in the classification and post-classification process. The MASC successfully extracted ISA from high spatial resolution airborne true-color digital orthophoto and space-borne QuickBird-2 imagery in the testing areas, and then was extended for extraction of high spatial resolution ISA in the State of Rhode Island."

The studied stand variables were mean height, basal area per hectare, and the volume of the growing stock. Several approaches were tested when combining the image data sources: feature selection, feature weighting, satellite image-based stratification, and combination of individual estimates by weighting.The highest accuracies were obtained when both data sources were used.

Single-date analysis was conducted using the 1999 image, while both images were used to complete multi-temporal analysis. Both single- and multi-date datasets were classified using a traditional method (maximum likelihood classification: MLC) and a non-parametric technique (classification and regression trees: CART). Comparison of all techniques showed that MLC of a single image (1999) resulted in high accuracy compared to the other methods and that principal components analysis (PCA) and multitemporal PCA provided the best spectral separability between burned and unburned areas."

Mapping and quantitative assessment of the habitats poses a major challenge. This study uses high spatial resolution airborne digital photographs and forward-looking infrared (FLIR) images, simultaneously acquired in spring 2005 over a 12 river kilometer section of the Unuk River in Southeast Alaska to map macro habitat indicators for Pacific salmon such as large woody debris (LWD), water channels, sand/gravel bars, and riparian vegetation. Image processing revealed that LWD could best be extracted using contextual information from the digital photos. River channel water had prominent shadows cast from neighboring trees and could not be accurately classified using digital photos, but could be well-delineated using unsupervised classification of the FLIR images. All other classes showed up well using supervised classification of digital photos. Using a decision-based fusion approach, the best individual classification results obtained from the digital photos and FLIR images to generate an improved fluvial landscape classification map (land-cover map). Using a decision-based fusion method resulted in an overall classification accuracy of the study area to 84.29 percent, compared to 77.00 percent using supervised classification of aerial photos alone. This appears to be first time that high-resolution airborne thermal images have been used for fluvial landscape classification, and the study clearly demonstrates the value of using thermal images and decision-based fusion approach for improved land-cover classification."

Strengths of the Wal-Mart validation data set include: construction within most U.S. ecoregions, building footprints greater than a hectare in size, and construction dates that span much of the remote sensing record (1962 to 2004). We built the data set by geo-coding Wal-Mart addresses, establishing opening dates, and geolocating the footprints of 30 stores using online free highresolution (4 m) imagery. Disturbance events were evident at 25 Wal-Marts within a single scene of the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS-beta) forest disturbance product.

Such seasonality is typical of the mangrove forests we study along the Caribbean coast of Panama. Tied to this environmental variation are changes in leaf phenology and physiology that can affect the spectral properties of leaves and thus our ability to discriminate canopies of differing species composition. The goals of this study were two-fold. First, we compared the efficacy of three different classification methods for discriminating mangrove canopies, including a back-propagation, feed-forward neural network classifier with two hidden layers of 24 and 12 neurons (hereafter, BP:24:12), a newly developed clustering-based neural network classifier (CBNN), and a maximum likelihood classifier (MLC). Comparisons were made with and without added textural information. Our second aim was to compare the absolute and relative discrimination abilities of these methods when applied to images of the same forest acquired in different seasons. Two sets of Ikonos images acquired in February (dry season) and May (early wet season) 2004 were analyzed in this study. When only spectral information was considered, MLC and CBNN discriminated differences in canopy species composition with higher accuracy than the BP:24:12 method. When second-order textural information was also taken into account, CBNN outperformed MLC and presented the best classification accuracy, i.e., kappa value equaled 0.93. Analyses of the wet season (May) image were consistently more accurate in discriminating mangrove canopies of differing species composition than analyses of the dry season (February) image, regardless of the classification method or the inclusion of textural information."

We take as our empirical case fragmentation in the Brazilian Amazon basin associated with road-building by loggers. Roads built by the private sector, particularly loggers, play a decisive role in the dynamics of frontier expansion in the Amazon. Our objective is to explain the manner in which logging roads manifest spatially, thereby creating fragmented landscapes in a small portion of the so-called “Terra do Meio,” a region of 300,000 km2in the heart of the Amazon basin. We combine geostatistical methods with GIS to replicate a common fragmentation pattern found in tropical forests known as dendritic. Such fragmentation has been identified as one of the three most common types observed in the Amazon basin. The model replicates the general dendritic pattern and many branching points of the network, although segments do not overlay precisely. The paper concludes with a discussion of steps necessary to develop a model that is fully effective in describing the spatial decision-making of loggers."

Globally, the oil palm industry plans to double the area under cultivation to meet growing demands for both vegetable oils and biodiesel. Accurate assessment and monitoring of African palm extensification and intensification for both development and sustainability is crucial given that these crops are replacing the natural high-biodiversity forests as well as local subsistence agriculture. Using a simultaneous collection of RADARSAT synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and ground based digital video, we describe and model the spatial distribution of African palm and explore its lifecycle placing it in the regional ecological context of the Ecuadorian, Amazon. We evaluate the strengths and limitations of integrating RADARSAT texture information, Landsat ETM+, and digital video data to distinguish African oil palm plantations from other land-use and land-cover (LULC) categories. The grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and a separate hybrid classification approach using a concatenation of SAR-optical products were tested. A significant improvement in the classification accuracy of African palm in the context of the Ecuadorian Amazon was obtained through the fusion of optical and RADARSAT texture measures as compared to single sensor classifications. The fusion of single ETM+ bands with texture measures achieved the highest user’s and producer’s accuracy with 83 percent and 90 percent, respectively."

Approaches are examined that include the use of Principal Components Analysis to compress the Hyperion hyperspectral data to its most vital spectral channels; linear mixture modeling to derive sub-pixel fractions of land-use/land-cover types through the generation of spectral endmembers; and supervised and unsupervised classifications to map forest regrowth, agricultural crops and pasture, and other land-uses on 18 survey farms that are spatially coincident with the imagery. A longitudinal socio-economic and demographic survey (1990 and 1999) is used to characterize household farms; a community survey (2000) is used to assess nearby market towns and service centers; GIS is used to represent the resource endowments of farms and their geographic accessibility. Statistical relationships are examined using Spear-man rank correlation coefficients to assess the linkages among a number of selected social, geographical, and biophysical variables and secondary and successional forest on household farms. Relationships suggest the importance of household characteristics, farm resources, and geographic access of secondary forests on surveyed household farms that were previously deforested and converted to agriculture through extensification processes. Results support the integrated use of hyperspectral and hyper-spatial data for characterizing forest regrowth on household farms, and the use of multi-dimensional social survey data and GIS to assess plausible causes and consequences of land-use/land-cover dynamics in the NEA."
Trajectories of Land-use and Land-cover in the Northern Ecuadorian Amazon,"Mena, Carlos F.",pp. 737-751(15),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000006/art00004;jsessionid=4i3hbdmq6oisp.x-ic-live-01,"This paper explores the temporal composition of the main Land-use/Land-cover (LULC) trajectories, examines the spatial configuration of the trajectories, and derives the probabilities of transitions in the Northern Ecuadorian Amazon (NEA). This research uses a time-series of classified Landsat images that ranges from 1974 to 2002, and a set of spatial socioeconomic, demographic, and accessibility data assembled in a geographic information system. The LULC trajectories are analyzed for the Northern Intensive Study Area (NISA) using image algebra, and for the whole region, the NEA, using cluster analysis, landscape ecology principles, and spatial logistic regression models. In general, the trajectories are dominated (i.e., in terms of area) by recent transitions that contain forested classes (i.e., primary forest or succession), as well as the consistent representation of pasture through time. This exploratory analysis of LULC transitions suggests a set of clusters that form a “core and periphery” pattern in the NEA. This research shows how these clusters and probabilities of change can be used to characterize trajectories of LULC in the region."

A time-series of 85 TM/ETM+ scenes spanning the period from 1989 through 2002 was used to decompose derived landscape dynamics into trends, annual and seasonal cycles, and long term oscillations. The harmonic fit largely defined by climatic periodicities (semi-annual, annual, and quasidecadal) accounted for 63 percent to 88 percent of the variance in the trajectories. The trends were found to be robust whether or not urban settlement or landscape management regimes were explicitly included, though there was a reversal of trend in agricultural areas."
"Characterizing Patterns of Land Degradation Potential and Agro-Ecological Sustainability in Nang Rong, Thailand","Welsh, William F.",pp. 765-773(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000006/art00006;jsessionid=4i3hbdmq6oisp.x-ic-live-01,"Soil crop suitability data was used to characterize and evaluate land-use/land-cover (LULC) classifications derived from Landsat TM and MSS imagery for 1997, 1985, and 1972. Landsat spectral classifications were post-processed using GIS data into a time-series of pixels that were identified as having agricultural potential (not including household gardens within settlements), and then compared with soil suitability variables to characterize LULC patterns and assess the likelihood of potential for land degradation within the Nang Rong, Thailand study area. Results of this estimate indicate that for extensive areas of upland cash cropping, particularly in the case of cassava, a significant potential for land degradation and hence agro-ecological unsustainability exists. Lowland rain-fed rice cropping, the most areally extensive and temporally persistent form of agriculture, is revealed to be largely agro-ecologically sustainable. A trend in the Nang Rong region is towards planting fast growing eucalyptus trees, a non-native species known to be damaging to the soil and ecology, as a cash crop in both upland and lowland settings for pulpwood, construction framing, and biofuel feedstock, making future potential land degradation scenarios somewhat different than in the past and ongoing monitoring critical."

We analyzed implications of land-cover patterns for vulnerability to flooding in the Poyang Lake Region. Land-cover and change were mapped using multitemporal Landsat TM/ETM+ images at high and low water levels from 1987, 1993, 1999, and 2004. Vulnerability to flooding was analyzed based on the distribution of land covers relative to elevation and the levee quality. Results showed that patterns of Farmland, Urban, and Wetland covers varied by elevation, by the relative likelihood of flooding within polders, and over time; the general trend, with some notable exceptions, was toward less vulnerability of farmland and urban areas to flooding. Factors of markets, laws and regulations have likely influenced changes in landcover patterns and, therefore, in vulnerability."

We used the 1972 to 2001 Landsat archive bracketing this transition to observe change trends in southern central Siberian Russia in primarily forested study sites. Landsat resolved conifer, mixed, deciduous and young forest; cuts, burns, and insect disturbance; and wetland, agriculture, bare, urban, and water land covers. Over 70 percent of forest area in the three study sites was likely disturbed prior to 1974. Conifer forest decreased over the 1974 to 2001 study period, with the greatest decrease 1974 to 1990. Logging activity (primarily in conifers) declined more during the 1991 to 2001 post-Soviet period. The area of Young forest increased more during the 1974 to 1990 time period. Deciduous forest increased over both time periods. Agriculture declined over both time periods contributing to forest regrowth in this region."
A Standardized Probability Comparison Approach for Evaluating and Combining Pixel-based Classification Procedures,"Chen, DongMei",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000005/art00001;jsessionid=105k08fpoja03.x-ic-live-01,"In this paper, a standardized probability approach is presented to evaluate the pixel labeling confidence of each pixel and then combine the classification maps generated from different classification procedures for improving classification accuracy. This approach examines the posterior probability of the maximum-likelihood classifier or inverse-distance weight for the minimum-distance classifier for each pixel. It recommends that, for every classification, a standardized probability map should be outputted along with the classified map to show the pixel labeling confidence for all pixels. Tests based on different feature combinations and training strategies from Ikonos data show that the proposed approach was effective in improving the labeling confidence, as well as overall classification accuracy when classified maps from different classification procedures were combined. This standardized probability can be used to provide additional spatial information along with the traditional accuracy assessment."
Shadow-Effect Correction in Aerial Color Imagery,"Sohn, Hong-Gyoo; Yun, Kong-Hyun",pp. 611-618(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000005/art00002;jsessionid=105k08fpoja03.x-ic-live-01,"Due to the existence of shadows, especially in urban environments, it is difficult to extract semantic information from aerial and high-resolution satellite images. In this paper, an efficient method of correcting shadow effects using multisource data sets in aerial color images is proposed. The proposed method has three steps. First, it accurately detects the shadowed regions using the image geometry and the solar position of the image acquisition data. Then, the detected shadowed regions are segmented according to land surface type. Finally, the shadow effects of the segmented regions are corrected by directly comparing the same nonshadow features with the segmented shadows. In the application part of this paper, the proposed techniques were applied in the extraction of an asphalt road from an image."
A New Spectral Index for Estimating the Oriental Migratory Locust Density,"Zha, Yong; Ni, Shaoxiang; Gao, Jay; Liu, Zhenbo",pp. 619-624(6),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000005/art00003;jsessionid=105k08fpoja03.x-ic-live-01,"It is very important to acquire timely information on the spatial distribution of locust populations in order to bring a locust outbreak under control quickly. In this study, we propose a new method for estimating the Oriental migratory locust density using a Locust Density Index (LDI). This index is based on the change in vegetation before an outbreak and shortly after the outbreak, taking into account the pre-outbreak vegetation conditions as well. This method was applied to study three locust-infested sites in Huanghua City, Hebei Province in China during a 2002 outbreak. NDVI images were derived from radiometrically corrected multi-temporal Landsat TM/ETM+ data recorded during and after the outbreak. After radiometry of the post-outbreak NDVI image was standardized to that of its during-outbreak counterpart, their difference multiplied by the pre-outbreak NDVI (termed LDI) was used to map the density of locusts at five levels of no locust, low, moderate, high, and very high. Nearly 90 percent of the study sites had a low to moderate locust density. Results produced with the proposed LDI method are similar to those observed on the ground with an accuracy of 88.9 percent. This proposed LDI method is easy to implement. It allows quick and accurate mapping of locust density from satellite data."

In this paper, we describe a new automated scheme that utilizes the so-called “climbingand-sliding” method to search for ground points from lidar point clouds for DEM generation. The new method has the capability of performing a local search while preserving the merits of a global treatment. This is done by emulating the natural movements of climbing and sliding in order to search for ground points on a terrain surface model. To improve efficiency and accuracy, the scheme is implemented with a pseudo-grid data and includes a back selection step for densification. The test data include a dataset released from the ISPRS Working Group III/3 and one for a mountainous area located in southern Taiwan. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is capable at producing a high fidelity terrain model."
A Weighted Least Squares Approach for Estimation of Land Surface Temperature Using Constraint Equations,"Momeni, Mehdi; Saradjian, Mohammad Reza",pp. 637-646(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000005/art00005;jsessionid=105k08fpoja03.x-ic-live-01,"Estimation of land surface temperature and emissivity has taken on a great deal of importance in recent remote sensing studies. The estimation of temperature and emissivity from thermal radiation observations is involved with an underdetermined equation set. In this study, an approach is proposed to overcome the problem based on statistical theory of observations and error propagation. First, the under-determined radiance equations have been completed using two NDVI-based equations for the mean and difference emissivities as constraint equations. The two added constraint equations provide the possibility of weighted least squares solution to estimate temperature and emissivity from the over-determined equation set simultaneously. The weights have been calculated based on the uncertainty of each of the equations. The weighting basis of the proposed approach allows statistical control on the uncertainties. The advantages of the weighted least squares solution which is contributed by this study are weighted observations used in the solution, the uncertainty considerations of the used observations, uncertainty propagation control, statistical standard deviation estimation for the unknowns, statistical quality control criteria, and the opportunity of systematic error detection. The numerical efficiency of the proposed approach is examined using a great number of simulated sample data. Then, the proposed approach is validated using the in situ measurements of land surface temperature. The validations accompanied by some statistical tests represent the acceptable performance and accuracy of the proposed approach (approximately 0.5°K for LST standard deviation and approximately 0.0075 for standard deviation of the bands 31 and 32 emissivities). In addition, the simplicity and robustness of the proposed approach may be regarded as a considerable achievement."
Comparison of Nine Fusion Techniques for Very High Resolution Data,"Nikolakopoulos, Konstantinos G.",pp. 647-659(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000005/art00006;jsessionid=105k08fpoja03.x-ic-live-01,"The term “image fusion” covers multiple techniques used to combine the geometric detail of a high-resolution panchromatic image and the color information of a lowresolution multispectral image to produce a final image with the highest possible spatial information content while still preserving good spectral information quality.During the last twenty years, many methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multiplicative Transform, Brovey Transform, and IHS Transform have been developed producing good quality fused images. Despite the quite good visual results, many research papers have reported the limitations of the above fusion techniques. The most significant problem is color distortion. Another common problem is that the fusion quality often depends upon the operator’s fusion experience and upon the data set being fused.In this study, we compare the efficiency of nine fusion techniques and more specifically the efficiency of IHS, Modified IHS, PCA, Pansharp, Wavelet, LMM (Local Mean Matching), LMVM (Local Mean and Variance Matching), Brovey, and Multiplicative fusion techniques for the fusion of QuickBird data. The suitability of these fusion techniques for various applications depends on the spectral and spatial quality of the fused images.In order to quantitatively measure the quality of the fused images, we have made the following controls. First, we have examined the visual qualitative result. Then, we examined the correlation between the original multispectral and the fused images and all the statistical parameters of the histograms of the various frequency bands. Finally, we performed an unsupervised classification, and we compared the resulting images.All the fusion techniques improve the resolution and the visual result. The resampling method practically has no effect on the final visual result. The LMVM, the LMM, the Pansharp, and the Wavelet merging technique do not change the statistical parameters of the original images. The Modified IHS provokes minor changes to the statistical parameters than the classical IHS or than the PCA. After all the controls, the LMVM, the LMM, the Pansharp, and the Modified IHS algorithm seem to gather the more advantages in fusion panchromatic and multispectral data."
Performance of GPS Precise Point Positioning Under Conifer Forest Canopies,"Næsset, Erik; Gjevestad, Jon Glenn",pp. 661-668(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000005/art00007;jsessionid=105k08fpoja03.x-ic-live-01,"A 20-channel, dual-frequency GPS receiver collecting pseudorange and carrier phase observations was used as a stand-alone receiver to determine positional accuracy of 19 points under conifer tree canopies. The positions were determined utilizing precise satellite orbit and clock products from the International GNSS Service. The mean positional accuracy ranged from 0.27 to 0.88 m for an observation period of 120 minutes, and 0.95 to 3.48 m for 15 minutes. For the 15 minute observation period computed positions could not be found for 8 to 44 percent of the locations. Accuracy increased with decreasing forest stand density. Stand basal area (R2 = 0.11, p < 0.001) and number of tree stems (R2 = 0.07, p < 0.001) were significantly correlated with accuracy. The probability of determining a position increased with longer observation periods and decreasing number of tree stems. For natural resource applications where the costs associated with the length of the observation period on each site in field is a critical factor, differential GPS seems to be a more robust alternative than precise point positioning with GPS."

In an effort to contribute to the automation of this process, we introduce Size-Constrained Region Merging (SCRM), a recently implemented software tool that provides the interpreter with an initial template of the tobe- mapped area that may reduce the manual digitization portion of the interpretation. In essence, SCRM transforms an ortho-rectified aerial or satellite image (single or multichannel) into a polygon vector layer that resembles the work of a human interpreter, whom with no a priori knowledge of the scene, was given the task of partitioning the image into a number of homogeneous polygons all exceeding a minimum size. We provide background information on SCRM foundations and workflow, and illustrate its application on three different types of satellite images."
Integration of Landsat TM and SPOT HRG Images for Vegetation Change Detection in the Brazilian Amazon,"Lu, Dengsheng; Batistella, Mateus; Moran, Emilio",pp. 421-430(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000004/art00002;jsessionid=243ov1whxm0gi.x-ic-live-02,"Traditional change detection approaches have been proven to be difficult in detecting vegetation changes in the moist tropical regions with multitemporal images. This paper explores the integration of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and SPOT High Resolution Geometric (HRG) instrument data for vegetation change detection in the Brazilian Amazon. A principal component analysis was used to integrate TM and HRG panchromatic data. Vegetation change/non-change was detected with the image differencing approach based on the TM and HRG fused image and the corresponding TM image. A rule-based approach was used to classify the TM and HRG multispectral images into thematic maps with three coarse land-cover classes: forest, non-forest vegetation, and non-vegetation lands. A hybrid approach combining image differencing and post-classification comparison was used to detect vegetation change trajectories. This research indicates promising vegetation change techniques, especially for vegetation gain and loss, even if very limited reference data are available."
Reducing Edge Effects in the Classification of High Resolution Imagery,"Zhou, Guiyun; Lam, Nina S.-N.",pp. 431-441(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000004/art00003;jsessionid=243ov1whxm0gi.x-ic-live-02,Edge effects have been a problem in image classification especially when scale-based textural methods were included in the classification process. This paper proposes a new approach to reducing edge effects. The essence of the new approach is that all pixels in a moving window make use of the textural information instead of only the center pixel as in the traditional moving window method. The performance of the new approach was tested in three classification scenarios. The results show that the new approach generally produced higher accuracy with larger window size and was much less affected by the edge issues than the traditional moving window method. The new approach yields satisfactory results as long as the window size is smaller than the land-use polygons and the class boundaries are not too complex.
Generation of Advanced ERS and Envisat Interferometric SAR Products Using the Stable Point Network Technique,"Crosetto, Michele; Biescas, Erlinda; Duro, Javier; Closa, Josep; Arnaud, Alain",pp. 443-450(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000004/art00004;jsessionid=243ov1whxm0gi.x-ic-live-02,"The advanced differential interferometric SAR techniques (A-DINSAR), based on time series of SAR images, are powerful geodetic tools for land deformation monitoring.

Furthermore, it illustrates the performance of the technique on a test area located in Barcelona, Spain. From this experiment, interesting features are highlighted: the capability to cover wide areas and at the same time measuring thin infrastructures, such as the main dike of the port; the good agreement between the deformation velocities and the reference values coming from leveling campaigns; the high sensitivity of the A-DINSAR estimations, which can measure millimeter-level periodical deformations due to thermal dilation, and the precise geocoding of the A-DINSAR products."

Current research mainly focuses on the impact of land-use and land-cover (LULC) on LST. Seldom has research examined LST variations based on the integration of biophysical and demographic variables, especially for a rapidly developing city such as Beijing, China. This study combines the techniques of remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) to detect the spatial variation of LST and determine its quantitative relationship with several biophysical and demographic variables based on statistical modeling for the central area of Beijing. LST and LULC data were retrieved from a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image. Building heights were delimited from the shadows identified on a panchromatic SPOT image. The integration of LULC and census data was further applied to retrieve grid-based population density. Results indicate that the LST pattern was non-symmetrical and non-concentric with high temperature zones clustered towards the south of the central axis and within the fourth ring road. The percentage of forest, farmland, and water per grid cell were found to be most significant factors, which can explain 71.3 percent of LST variance. Principal component regression analysis shows that LST was positively correlated with the percentage of low density built-up, high density built-up, extremely-high buildings, low buildings per grid cell, and population density, but was negatively correlated with the percentage of forest, farmland, and water bodies per grid cell. The findings of this study can be applied as the theoretical basis for improving urban planning for mitigating the effects of urban heat islands."

The study area was a rapidly developing 71.5 km2part of suburban Raleigh, North Carolina, U.S.A., within the Neuse River basin. “Edge pixels” were a source of classification error as was spectral overlap between bare soil and impervious surfaces and among vegetated cover types. Shadows were not a significant source of classification error. These findings demonstrate that conventional spectral-based classification methods can be used to generate highly accurate maps of urban landscapes using high spatial resolution imagery."

A major environmental change associated with this urbanization trend is the transformation of the landscape from natural cover types to increasingly anthropogenic impervious surface. This research utilizes remote sensing data from both the Landsat and Terra-Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instruments in conjunction with digital orthophotography to estimate urban extent and its temporal changes by determining sub-pixel impervious surfaces. Percent impervious surface area has shown encouraging agreement with urban land extent and development density. Results indicate that total urban land-use increases approximately 110 percent from 1984 to 2002. Most of the increases are associated with medium-to high-density urban development. Places having significant increases in impervious surfaces are in the northwestern and southeastern parts of Las Vegas. Most high-density urban development, however, appears in central Las Vegas. Impervious surface conditions for 2002 measured from Landsat and ASTER satellite data are compared in terms of their accuracy."

The goal was to evaluate the geometric quality of the ASTER system and the stability of the Terra spacecraft. ASTER is a 15-band system containing optical instruments with resolutions from 15- to 90-meters; all geometrically registered products are ultimately tied to the 15-meter Visible and Near Infrared (VNIR) sub-system. Our evaluation process first involved establishing a large database of Ground Control Points (GCP) in the mid-western United States; an area with features of an appropriate size for spacecraft instrument resolutions. We used standard U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Digital Orthophoto Quads (DOQs) of areas in the mid-west to locate accurate GCPs by systematically identifying road intersections and recording their coordinates. Elevations for these points were derived fromUSGSDigital Elevation Models (DEMs). Road intersections in a swath of nine contiguous ASTER scenes were then matched to the GCPs, including terrain correction. We found no significant distortion in the images; after a simple image offset to absolute position, the RMS residual of about 200 points per scene was less than one-half a VNIR pixel. Absolute locations were within 80 meters, with a slow drift of about 10 meters over the entire 530-kilometer swath. Using strictly simultaneous observations of scenes 370 kilometers apart, we determined a stereo angle correction of 0.00134 degree with an accuracy of one microradian. The mid-west GCP field and the techniques used here should be widely applicable in assessing other spacecraft instruments having resolutions from 5 to 50-meters."
A Generic Model for Along-track Stereo Sensors Using Rigorous Orbit Mechanics,"Michalis, Pantelis; Dowman, Ian",pp. 303-309(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000003/art00002;jsessionid=1r5wop5gdr9f8.x-ic-live-03,"In this paper a generic, rigorous sensor model for high-resolution optical satellite sensors with along-track stereoscopic capabilities is introduced. The idea is to determine the orbit of the satellite platform covering the time acquisition of all images, using satellite photogrammetry in combination with astrodynamics, trying to find common exterior orientation parameters for all images directly or indirectly. As a result, the number of unknown parameters is reduced and also the correlation between them, thus giving a more stable solution. Great effort is made in order to define the essential forces which are involved in the acquisition of the pushbroom images, according to the needed accuracy and the data provided. The fundamental assumption is that Keplerian motion is maintained along the acquisition time of all the along-track images. Various versions of the model are developed based on different orbit determination-propagation methods. An accuracy assessment is made of the above different orbit determination-propagation methods. It is possible to extract the exterior orientation of all images together directly, without ground control points and using the metadata information, with acceptable accuracy. The model is evaluated using SPOT5-HRS imagery with precision close to pixel size. Moreover, the accuracy of the along-track model is compared with the accuracy of single image sensor model."

A maximum likelihood classifier was used to classify the different image combinations into thematic maps. This research indicated that data fusion based on HRG multispectral and panchromatic data slightly improved vegetation classification accuracies: a 3.1 to 4.6 percent increase in the kappa coefficient compared with the classification results based on original HRG or TM multispectral images. A combination of HRG spectral signatures and two textural images improved the kappa coefficient by 6.3 percent compared with pure HRG multispectral images. The textural images based on entropy or second-moment texture measures with a window size of 9 pixels×9 pixels played an important role in improving vegetation classification accuracy. Overall, optical remote-sensing data are still insufficient for accurate vegetation classifications in the Amazon basin."
Texture Feature Fusion with Neighborhood Oscillating Tabu Search for High Resolution Image Classification,"Zhang, Liangpei; Zhao, Yindi; Huang, Bo; Li, Pingxiang",pp. 323-331(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000003/art00004;jsessionid=1r5wop5gdr9f8.x-ic-live-03,"Multi-channel Gabor filters (MGFs) and Markov random fields (MRFs) are two common methods for texture analysis. This paper investigates their integration through a novel algorithm using the neighborhood-oscillating tabu search (NOTS) for high-resolution image classification. The NOTS algorithm fuses the texture features extracted by MGF and MRF. This algorithm has been compared with classical methods such as sequential forward selection, sequential forward floating selection, and oscillating search. Experimental results show that the fused MGF/MRF features have much higher discrimination than pure features, and NOTS outperforms other algorithms with either pure or fused features. The stability and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm have been verified using Brodatz, Ikonos, and QuickBird images."
Land-cover Classification Using ASTER Multi-band Combinations Based on Wavelet Fusion and SOM Neural Network,"Bagan, Hasi; Wang, Qinxue; Watanabe, Masataka; Kameyama, Satoshi; Bao, Yuhai",pp. 333-342(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000003/art00005;jsessionid=1r5wop5gdr9f8.x-ic-live-03,"In this study, we developed a land-cover classification methodology using Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) visible near-infrared (VNIR), shortwave infrared (SWIR), and thermal infrared (TIR) band combinations based on wavelet fusion and the self-organizing map (SOM) neural network methods, and compared the classification accuracies of different combinations of ASTER multi-band data. A wavelet fusion concept named ARSIS (Amélioration de la Résolution Spatiale par Injection de Structures) was used to fuse ASTER data in the preprocessing stage. In order to apply the wavelet fusion method to ASTER data, the principal components of ASTER VNIR data were computed. The first principal component was used as the base image for wavelet fusion. In our experiments, the spatial resolution of ASTER VNIR, SWIR, and TIR data was adjusted to the same 15 m. SOM classification accuracy was increased from 83 percent to 93 percent by this fusion, and classification accuracy increased along with the increase of band numbers. Classification accuracy reaches the highest value when all 14 bands are used, but classification accuracy closely approached the highest value when three VNIR bands, three SWIR bands, and two TIR bands were used. A similar tendency was also obtained by the maximum likelihood classification (MLC) method, but the classification accuracies of MLC over all band combinations were considerably obviously lower than those obtained by the SOM method."
Parametric Investigation of the Performance of Lidar Filters Using Different Surface Contexts,"Seo, Suyoung; O’Hara, Charles G.",pp. 343-362(20),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000003/art00006;jsessionid=1r5wop5gdr9f8.x-ic-live-03,"Lidar technology has provided an accurate and efficient way to obtain digital elevation models. While digital terrain models (DTMs) are essential products for three-dimensional spatial applications, extraction of ground points from a mixture of ground and non-ground points is not straightforward, and interactive classification of massive point data sets is prohibitive. To automate the filtering process, many algorithms have been proposed and demonstrated to produce satisfactory results when applied with suitably tuned parameters. For obtaining quality products using lidar filters, however, not only to figure out their optimal performance, but also to analyze the cause and effect relationships between filtering steps and their effects under variable conditions is important. Hence, this study examined the performance of three popular surface models for lidar data filtering: morphological operations, triangulation, and linear prediction. For the test, consistent setting of parameters was applied across considerably different landscape datasets. The strengths and weaknesses of the test filters were investigated by comparing the metrics of omission and commission errors and volumetric distortions, and by observing resulting DTMs and relevant surface profiles."
Analysis of Turbid Water Quality Using Airborne Spectrometer Data with a Numerical Weather Prediction Model-aided Atmospheric Correction,"Attila, Jenni; Pyhälahti, Timo; Hannonen, Tuula; Kallio, Kari; Pulliainen, Jouni; Koponen, Sampsa; Härmä, Pekka; Eloheimo, Karri",pp. 363-374(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000003/art00007;jsessionid=1r5wop5gdr9f8.x-ic-live-03,"The effects of an atmospheric correction method for water quality estimation have been studied and validated for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer for Applications (AISA) data. This novel approach uses atmospheric input parameters from a numerical weather prediction model: HIRLAM (High Resolution Limited Area Model). The atmospheric correction method developed by de Haan and Kokke (1996) corrects the spectrometer data according to the coefficients calculated using Moderate Resolution Transmittance Code (MODTRAN) radiative transfer code simulations. The airborne campaigns were carried out at lake and coastal Case 2 type water areas between 1996 and 1998. The water quality interpretation was made using the MERIS satellite instrument wavelengths. The correction improved most of the water quality (turbidity, total suspended solids, and Secchi disk depth) estimates when data from several flight campaigns were used jointly. The atmospheric correction reduced the standard deviation of the measurements conducted on different days. The highest improvement was obtained in the estimation of turbidity."
Automatic Registration and Mosaicking for Airborne Multispectral Image Sequences,"Du, Qian; Raksuntorn, Nareenart; Orduyilmaz, Adnan; Bruce, Lori M.",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000002/art00001;jsessionid=wrtfev7ivfpl.x-ic-live-01,"Airborne remote sensing has important applications in agriculture monitoring because of the flexibility of system deployment. The major obstacle in practical use is its high cost. To reduce the cost, a multispectral system can be assembled by using individual cameras onboard a small aerial platform, such as a miniature unmanned aerial vehicle (mini-UAV). In such a case, the cameras may have shifting and rotational misalignment, even after careful adjustment. Contiguous frames are captured as the platform flies. So multi-band registration within a single frame and frame-to-frame mosaicking are necessary to obtain a co-registered multispectral image for the entire monitoring area before any commercial product can be generated to support practical decision-making. In this paper, we present automatic algorithms to achieve this goal. These algorithms are particularly useful to the image scenes where no distinctive features are available. Both automatic and manual evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the developed algorithms in multi-sensor data fusion for overall flat terrain without distinctive features."
Pixel Level Fusion of Panchromatic and Multispectral Images Based on Correspondence Analysis,"Cakir, Halil I.; Khorram, Siamak",pp. 183-192(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000002/art00002;jsessionid=wrtfev7ivfpl.x-ic-live-01,"A pixel level data fusion approach based on correspondence analysis (CA) is introduced for high spatial and spectral resolution satellite data. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a well-known multivariate data analysis and fusion technique in the remote sensing community. Related to PCA but a more recent multivariate technique, correspondence analysis, is applied to fuse panchromatic data with multi-spectral data in order to improve the quality of the final fused image. In the CA-based fusion approach, fusion takes place in the last component as opposed to the first component of the PCA-based approach. This new approach is then quantitatively compared to the PCA fusion approach using Landsat ETM∂, QuickBird, and two Ikonos (with and without dynamic range adjustment) test imagery. The new approach provided an excellent spectral accuracy when synthesizing images from multispectral and high spatial resolution panchromatic imagery."
Multispectral and Panchromatic Data Fusion Assessment Without Reference,"Alparone, Luciano; Aiazzi, Bruno; Baronti, Stefano; Garzelli, Andrea; Nencini, Filippo; Selva, Massimo",pp. 193-200(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000002/art00003;jsessionid=wrtfev7ivfpl.x-ic-live-01,"This paper introduces a novel approach for evaluating the quality of pansharpened multispectral (MS) imagery without resorting to reference originals. Hence, evaluations are feasible at the highest spatial resolution of the panchromatic (PAN) sensor. Wang and Bovik’s image quality index (QI) provides a statistical similarity measurement between two monochrome images. The QI values between any couple of MS bands are calculated before and after fusion and used to define a measurement ofspectraldistortion. Analogously, QI values between each MS band and the PAN image are calculated before and after fusion to yield a measurement ofspatialdistortion. The rationale is that such QI values should be unchanged after fusion, i.e., when the spectral information is translated from the coarse scale of the MS data to the fine scale of the PAN image. Experimental results, carried out on very high-resolution Ikonos data and simulated Pléiades data, demonstrate that the results provided by the proposed approach are consistent and in trend with analysis performed on spatially degraded data. However, the proposed method requires no reference originals and is therefore usable in all practical cases."
Anomaly Detection in Hyperspectral Imagery by Fuzzy Integral Fusion of Band-subsets,"Di, Wei; Pan, Quan; He, Lin; Cheng, Yongmei",pp. 201-213(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000002/art00004;jsessionid=wrtfev7ivfpl.x-ic-live-01,"Anomaly detection in hyperspectral imagery is gaining increasing interest. However, most covariance matrix-based detectors are applied directly to all the hyperspectral data bands without considering the spectral variation and their possible different contribution to detection. Besides, the limited sample number as compared with the high dimensionality of the data can lead to the imprecise estimation of the covariance matrix and even the singularity problem. In this paper, a band-subset fuzzy integral fusion (BS-FI) detection method is presented to solve these problems. The complete set of hyperspectral data bands is first partitioned into several lower dimensional band-subsets, whose detection results are obtained separately and finally merged by a fuzzy integral fusion method. We adopt a non-parametric fuzzy support function which can utilize more statistical information and avoid the model discrepancy that might be brought in by a fixed distribution model. In addition, the fuzzy density is assigned by the ratio between the target signal and noise, which is the key to the target detection problem through an adaptive eigenvalue-based approach. In the experiments on real OMIS-I hyperspectral imagery, the proposed method outperforms the RX detector both on the complete set of bands and on each band-subset, and other band-subset fusion detectors."

Our algorithm consists of three steps. In the first step, we extract initial building regions from lidar data. Here, we apply a modified local maxima technique coupled with directional histograms and the entropies of these histograms. In the second step, given the color segmentation results from the photogrammetric imagery, we extract coarse building boundaries based on the lidar results with region segmentation and merging from aerial imagery. In the third step, we extract precise building boundaries based on the coarse building boundaries using line segments matching and perceptual grouping. Experimental results on multi-sensor data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm produces accurate and reliable results."
Extracting Urban Road Networks from High-resolution True Orthoimage and Lidar,"Youn, Junhee; Bethel, James S.; Mikhail, Edward M.; Lee, Changno",pp. 227-237(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000002/art00006;jsessionid=wrtfev7ivfpl.x-ic-live-01,"Automated or semi-automated feature extraction from remotely collected, large scale image data has been a challenging issue in digital photogrammetry for many years. In the feature extraction field, fusing different types of data to provide complementary information about the objects is becoming increasingly important. In this paper, we present a newly developed approach for the automatic extraction of urban area road networks from a true orthoimage and lidar assuming the road network to be a semi-grid pattern. The proposed approach starts from the subdivision of a study area into small regions based on homogeneity of the dominant road directions from the true orthoimage. Each region’s road candidates are selected with a proposed free passage measure. This process is called the “acupuncture” method. Features around the road candidates are used as key factors for an advanced “acupuncture method” called the region-based acupuncture method. Extracted road candidates are edited to avoid collocation with non-road features such as buildings and grass fields. In order to produce a building map for the prior step, a first-last return analysis and morphological filter are used with the lidar point cloud. A grass area thematic map is generated by supervised classification techniques from a synthetic image, which contains the three color bands from the true orthoimage and the lidar intensity value. Those non-road feature maps are used as a blocking mask for the roads. The accuracy of the result is evaluated quantitatively with respect to manually compiled road vectors, and a completeness of 80 percent and a correctness of 79 percent are obtained with the proposed algorithm on an area of 1,081,600 square meters."
Multisource Classification Using Support Vector Machines,"Watanachaturaporn, Pakorn; Arora, Manoj K.; Varshney, Pramod K.",pp. 239-246(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000002/art00007;jsessionid=wrtfev7ivfpl.x-ic-live-01,"Remote sensing image classification has proven to be attractive for extracting useful thematic information such as land-cover. However, often for a given application, spectral information acquired by a remote sensing sensor may not be sufficient to derive accurate information. Incorporation of data from other sources such as a digital elevation model (DEM), and geophysical and geological data may assist in achieving more accurate land-cover classification from remote sensing images. Recently, support vector machines (SVM) have been proposed as an alternative for classification of remote sensing data, and the results are promising. In this paper, we employ the SVM algorithm to perform multi-source classification. An IRS–1C LISS III image along with normalized differenced vegetation index (NDVI) image andDEMare used to produce a land-cover classification for a region in the Himalayas. The accuracy of SVM-based multi-source classification is compared with several other nonparametric algorithms namely a decision tree classifier, and back propagation and radial basis function neural network classifiers. The well-known kappa coefficient of agreement is used to assess classification accuracy. The differences in the kappa coefficient of classifiers have been statistically evaluated using a pairwise Z-test. The results show a significant increase in the accuracy of the SVM based classifier on incorporation of ancillary data over classification performed solely on the basis of spectral data from remote sensing sensors."
"Mapping Vegetation Communities Using Statistical Data Fusion in the Ozark National Scenic Riverways, Missouri, USA","Chastain, Robert A.; Struckhoff, Matthew A.; He, Hong S.; Larsen, David R.",pp. 247-264(18),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000002/art00008;jsessionid=wrtfev7ivfpl.x-ic-live-01,"A vegetation community map was produced for the Ozark National Scenic Riverways consistent with the association level of the National Vegetation Classification System. Vegetation communities were differentiated using a large array of variables derived from remote sensing and topographic data, which were fused into independent mathematical functions using a discriminant analysis classification approach. Remote sensing data provided variables that discriminated vegetation communities based on differences in color, spectral reflectance, greenness, brightness, and texture. Topographic data facilitated differentiation of vegetation communities based on indirect gradients (e.g., landform position, slope, aspect), which relate to variations in resource and disturbance gradients. Variables derived from these data sources represent both actual and potential vegetation community patterns on the landscape. A hybrid combination of statistical and photointerpretation methods was used to obtain an overall accuracy of 63 percent for a map with 49 vegetation community and land-cover classes, and 78 percent for a 33-class map of the study area."
Map Registration of Image Sequences Using Linear Features,"Wang, Caixia; Stefanidis, Anthony; Croitoru, Arie; Agouris, Peggy",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000001/art00001;jsessionid=564nb595bn0mh.x-ic-live-02,"This paper proposes an automatic and fast algorithm for registering aerial image sequences to vector map data using linear features as control information. Our method is based on the extraction of linear features using active contour models (also known as, snakes), followed by the construction of a polygonal template upon which a matching process is applied. To accommodate more robust matching, this work presents both exact and inexact matching schemes for linear features. Additionally, in order to overcome the influence of the snakes-based extraction process on the matching results, a matching refinement process is suggested. Using the information derived from the matching process, we then determine the transformation parameters between overlapping images and generate a mosaic image sequence, which can then be registered to a map. The performance of the proposed scheme was tested on sequences of aerial imagery of 1 m resolution that were subjected to shifts and rotations using both the exact and inexact matching scheme, and was shown to produce angular accuracy of less than 0.7 degrees and positional accuracy of less than two pixels."

This paper is focused on the issues related to cadastral forestlands digital mapping, an indispensable part of HCP. Mapping the forestlands is a challenge of multiple disciplines. It includes photogrammetry, photointerpretation, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and a clear understanding of the current institutional and legislative setting. The process requires both historical and current information pertaining to land-cover in order to identify forestland changes over time. Historical and current digital orthoimagery is generated through photogrammetric operations. Forestlands are delineated in a spatiotemporal environment; state property rights in forestlands are allocated and land ownership is established within the framework of HCP. This paper demonstrates that the integration of airborne remote sensing and collateral data with a GIS is an effective approach for cadastral forest mapping. The produced GIS databases and large-scale Forest Maps may serve as a data foundation towards a land register of forests."
The Influence of DEM Accuracy on Topographic Correction of Ikonos Satellite Images,"Nichol, Janet; Hang, Law Kin",pp. 47-53(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000001/art00003;jsessionid=564nb595bn0mh.x-ic-live-02,"There is no research which specifically investigates the influence of the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) on topographic correction of satellite images. Such an investigation is necessary in view of the very high resolution (VHR) of recent sensors such as Ikonos and QuickBird and the low availability of accurate height information for the derivation of slope and aspect values. A comparative study of multispectral Ikonos images is presented using eight selected interpolation techniques with contour data. The DEM influence was evaluated by analyzing the variance and classification accuracy of topographically corrected images using the different DEMS. These were found to vary widely, with a 30 percent reduction in variance and a 20 percent improvement in overall classification accuracy between the worst and best performing interpolation techniques. Furthermore, smoothing techniques commonly used for the removal of noise in interpolated contour data or in existing DEMs were found to offer no significant improvement in intra-class variance or classification accuracy, when used with a grid resolution compatible with VHR images. However, a more rigorous planar slope function was found to be more effective, and when combined with the best interpolator, the natural neighbor, or Sibson, method, very high classification accuracy was achieved in the topographically corrected images."

An efficient method that can simultaneously handle diverse input dimensions can be formed by merging fuzzy logic and neural networks. The so-called granular or fuzzy neural networks are able not only to achieve high classification levels, but at the same time produce compressed and transparent neural network skeletons. Compression results in reduced training times, while transparency is an aid for interpreting the structure of the neural network by translating it into meaningful rules and vice versa. The purpose of this paper is to provide some initial guidelines for the construction of granular neural networks in the remote sensing context, while using global elevation ancillary data within the classification process."
Using CASI Hyperspectral Imagery to Detect Mortality and Vegetation Stress Associated with a New Hardwood Forest Disease,"Pu, Ruiliang; Kelly, Maggi; Anderson, Gerald L.; Gong, Peng",pp. 65-75(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2008/00000074/00000001/art00005;jsessionid=564nb595bn0mh.x-ic-live-02,"A Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager-2 (CASI) dataset was used for detecting mortality and vegetation stress associated with a new forest disease. We first developed a multilevel classification scheme to improve classification accuracy. Then, the CASI raw data were transformed to reflectance and corrected for topography, and a principal component (PC) transformation of all 48 bands and the visible bands and NIR bands were separately conducted to extract features from the CASI data. Finally, we classified the calibrated and corrected CASI imagery using a maximum likelihood classifier and tested the relative accuracies of classification across the scheme. The multilevel scheme consists of four levels (Levels 0 to 3). Level 0 covered the entire study area, classifying eight classes (oak trees, California bay trees, shrub areas, grasses, dead trees, dry areas, wet areas, and water). At Level 1, the vegetated and non-vegetated areas were separated. The vegetated and non-vegetated areas were further subdivided into four vegetated (oak trees, California bay trees, shrub areas, grasses) and four non-vegetated (dead trees, dry areas, wet areas, and water) classes at Level 2. Level 3 identified stressed and non-stressed oak trees (two classes). The ten classes classified at different levels are defined as final classes in this study. The experimental results indicated that classification accuracy generally increased as the detailed classification level increased. When the CASI topographically corrected reflectance data were processed into ten PCs (five PCs from the visible region and five PCs from NIR bands), the classification accuracy for Level 2 vegetated classes (non-vegetated classes) increased to 80.15 percent (94.10 percent) from 78.07 percent (92.66 percent) at Level 0. The accuracy of separating stressed from non-stressed oak trees at Level 3 was 75.55 percent. When classified as a part of Level 0, the stressed and non-stressed were almost inseparable. Furthermore, we found that PCs derived from visible and NIR bands separately yielded more accurate results than the PCs from all 48 CASI bands."

The most visible advances were technologic improvisations, developed in the field that integrated the camera and the airplane to form, arguably, the most effective intelligence resource of the conflict. Technological innovations were accompanied by parallel developments in organizational and training infrastructures necessary to derive information for images acquired by these instruments. Interpretation techniques developed from simple annotations of oblique photographs acquired using handheld cameras to sophisticated analyses of images acquired by automatic cameras suspended in the aircraft fuselage. As the war concluded, efforts were underway to develop foundations for photogrammetric methods to derive accurate planimetry, which later formed foundations for civil applications of aerial photography."

The method is based on an image-to-image matching between the satellite data and an already geocoded image (i.e., a digital orthophoto). By using an adaptive least squares matching algorithm which implements a very robust outlier rejection technique, AGE can automatically measure many hundreds of topographic features (TFs) on the images, whose cartographic coordinates are derived from the geo-coded image and elevations are extracted from an associated digital elevation model (DEM). The AGE technique has been tested for different high-resolution data: (a) 0.62-meter QuickBird panchromatic data (basic imagery processing level), (b) 2.5-meter SPOT-5/HRG panchromatic supermode data (standard 1B processing level), and (c) 1-meter Ikonos panchromatic data (standard Geo product processing level) collected in the Northern of Italy, both in flat (Torino Caselle test site) and mountain areas (Lecco test site). Regardless the relative image resolution between the satellite and the aerial data (1-meter) and regardless the processing level of the original satellite data, a similar TFs density has been obtained for both the QuickBird and the SPOT-5/HRG data (4.4 GCPs/km2and 4.1 GCPs/km2) respectively, with a geometric accuracy for the GCPs extracted of 0.90 m for QuickBird and 3.90 m for SPOT-5/HRG. For the Ikonos imagery, AGE extracted a more dense set of GCPs (8.7 GCPs/km2) but with a lower accuracy (3.19 m). The TFs identified with AGE can be used as GCPs for the rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs) computation and, therefore, for implementing a full automatic orthoimage generation procedure. By using the commercial off-the-shelf software PCI Geomatica®v.9.1, orthoimages have been generated for all datasets. The geometric accuracy was verified on a set of 30 manually measured independent check points (CPs) and assessed a precision of 4.99 m RMSE for QuickBird, 5.99 m RMSE for SPOT-5/HRG, and 8.65 m RMSE for Ikonos. The use of a non-conventional image orthorectification technique implementing a neural network GCPs regularization, tested for the SPOT-5/HRG data, showed the full potential of the AGE method, allowing to obtain a 3.83 m RMSE orthoprojection in a fully automated way."

Thanks to the cloud penetrating and flexible swath-positioning capabilities of space-borne SAR at present, images can be acquired even at the interval of few days during a growing season. In this study, dual-polarization (VV/VH) Envisat SAR images with high a temporal resolution were used in association with limited ancillary data to monitor crop growth and to classify crop species. It was noticed that the high temporal resolution enabled nearly continuous monitoring, but it also caused problems because of the varying incidence angles. Moreover, to carry out field surveys rapidly enough for research purposes was observed as a problem. An R2of 0.55 was obtained for estimating the crop growth, when average crop height in parcels was used to describe the amount of biomass. An overall accuracy of 74.7 percent was achieved for crop species classification. Envisat VH polarization appeared to be useful in the estimation, even though, the noise equivalent σ0was too high to detect early crop growth. Field-based averaging was required, thus, for example for precision farming purposes a better spatial resolution would be needed to detect biomass variations within parcels."
Geometric Accuracy Assessment of QuickBird Basic Imagery Using Different Operational Approaches,"Aguilar, Manuel A.; Aguilar, Fernando J.; Agüera, Francisco; Sánchez, Jaime A.",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000012/art00001;jsessionid=1n9j3wm5823w8.x-ic-live-03,"The new very high-resolution space satellite images, such as QuickBird and Ikonos, open new possibilities in cartographic applications. This work has as its main aim the assessment of a methodology to achieve the best possible geometric accuracy in orthorectified imagery products obtained from QuickBird basic imagery which will include an assessment of the methodology’s reliability. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), mean error or bias, and maximum error in 79 independent check points are computed and utilized as accuracy indicators.The ancillary data were generated by high accuracy methods: (a) check and control points were measured with a differential global positioning system, and (b) a dense digital elevation model (DEM) with grid spacing of 2 m and RMSEzof about 0.31 m generated from a photogrammetric aerial flight at an approximate scale of 1:5000 that was used for image orthorectification. Two other DEMs with a grid spacing of 5 m (RMSEz= 1.75 m) and 20 m (RMSEz= 5.82 m) were also used.Four 3D geometric correction models were used to correct the satellite data: two terrain-independent rational function models refined by the user, a terrain-dependent model, and a rigorous physical model. The number and distribution of the ground control points (GCPs) used for the sensor orientation were studied as well, testing from 9 to 45 GCPs. The best results obtained about the geometric accuracy of the orthorectified images (two dimensional RMSE of about 0.74 m) were computed when the dense DEM was used with the 3D physical and terrain-dependent models. The use of more than 18 GCPs does not improve the results when those GCPs are extracted by stratified random sampling."

It is important to realize that the SRTM DEM represents the Earth’s surface (vegetation, snow) as seen by a C-band SAR in February 2000 and not necessarily the bare terrain. The accuracy of the DEMs depends on various factors including the terrain roughness/slope, land-cover, snow/ice, and vegetation. Herein, an accuracy assessment of the C-band SRTM DEM is performed through comparisons with independent elevation data obtained from the laser altimetry mission ICESat (4.7 million footprints) and terrestrial height information at 33,000 survey control monuments in Alberta, Canada. Temporal elevation changes due to snow cover and vegetation are considered and presented for the provinces of Quebec and Alberta. The analysis focuses on both data and datum issues, which are required to provide a realistic assessment of the achievable accuracy."
Consequences of Land-cover Misclassification in Models of Impervious Surface,"McMahon, Gerard",pp. 1343-1353(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000012/art00003;jsessionid=1n9j3wm5823w8.x-ic-live-03,"Model estimates of impervious area as a function of landcover area may be biased and imprecise because of errors in the land-cover classification. This investigation of the effects of land-cover misclassification on impervious surface models that use National Land Cover Data (NLCD) evaluates the consequences of adjusting land-cover within a watershed to reflect uncertainty assessment information. Model validation results indicate that using error-matrix information to adjust land-cover values used in impervious surface models does not substantially improve impervious surface predictions. Validation results indicate that the resolution of the landcover data (Level I and Level II) is more important in predicting impervious surface accurately than whether the land-cover data have been adjusted using information in the error matrix. Level I NLCD, adjusted for land-cover misclassification, is preferable to the other land-cover options for use in models of impervious surface. This result is tied to the lower classification error rates for the Level I NLCD."
Estimating Basal Area and Stem Volume for Individual Trees from Lidar Data,"Chen, Qi; Gong, Peng; Baldocchi, Dennis; Tian, Yong Q.",pp. 1355-1365(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000012/art00004;jsessionid=1n9j3wm5823w8.x-ic-live-03,"This study proposes a new metric called canopy geometric volume G, which is derived from small-footprint lidar data, for estimating individual-tree basal area and stem volume. Based on the plant allometry relationship, we found that basal area B is exponentially related to G (B = β1G3/4, where β1is a constant) and stem volume V is proportional to G (V = β2G, where β2is a constant). The models based on these relationships were compared with a number of models based on tree height and/or crown diameter. The models were tested over individual trees in a deciduous oak woodland in California in the case that individual tree crowns are either correctly or incorrectly segmented. When trees are incorrectly segmented, the theoretical model B = β1G3/4has the best performance (adjusted R2, R2a= 0.78) and the model V = β2G has the second to the best performance (R2a= 0.78). When trees are correctly segmented, the theoretical models are among the top three models for estimating basal area (R2a= 0.77) and stem volume (R2a= 0.79). Overall, these theoretical models are the best when considering a number of factors such as the performance, the model parsimony, and the sensitivity to errors in tree crown segmentation. Further research is needed to test these models over sites with multiple species."
A Theoretical Approach to Modeling the Accuracy Assessment of Digital Elevation Models,"Aguilar, Fernando J.; Agüera, Francisco; Aguilar, Manuel A.",pp. 1367-1379(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000012/art00005;jsessionid=1n9j3wm5823w8.x-ic-live-03,"In this paper, a theoretical analysis is presented of the degree of correctness to which the accuracy figures of a grid Digital Elevation Model (DEM) have been estimated, measured as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) depending on the number of checkpoints used in the accuracy assessment process. The latter concept is sometimes referred to as the Reliability of the DEM accuracy tests.Two theoretical models have been developed for estimating the reliability of the DEM accuracy figures using the number of checkpoints and parameters related to the statistical distribution of residuals (mean, variance, skewness, and standardized kurtosis). A general case was considered in which residuals might be weakly correlated (local spatial autocorrelation) with non-zero mean and non-normal distribution. Thus, we avoided the “strong assumption” of distribution normality accepted in some of the previous works and in the majority of the current standards of positional accuracy control methods.Sampled data were collected using digital photogrammetric methods applied to large scale stereo imagery (1:5 000). In this way, seven morphologies were sampled with a 2 m by 2 m sampling interval, ranging from flat (3 percent average slope) to the highly rugged terrain of marble quarries (82 percent average slope).Two local schemes of interpolation have been employed, using Multiquadric Radial Basis Functions (MRBF) and Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolators, to generate interpolated surfaces from high-resolution grid DEMs. The theoretical results obtained were experimentally validated using the Monte Carlo simulation method.The proposed models provided a good fit for the raw simulated data for the seven morphologies and the two schemes of interpolation tested (r2> 0.96 as mean value). The proposed theoretical models performed very well for modeling the non-gaussian distribution of the errors at the checkpoints, a property which is very common in geographically distributed data."
Extraction of Urban Built-up Land Features from Landsat Imagery Using a Thematicoriented Index Combination Technique,"Xu, Hanqiu",pp. 1381-1391(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000012/art00006;jsessionid=1n9j3wm5823w8.x-ic-live-03,"This paper proposes a technique to extract urban built-up land features from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery taking two cities in southeastern China as examples. The study selected three indices, Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) to represent three major urban land-use classes, built-up land, open water body, and vegetation, respectively. Consequently, the seven bands of an original Landsat image were reduced into three thematic-oriented bands derived from above indices. The three new bands were then combined to compose a new image. This considerably reduced data correlation and redundancy between original multispectral bands, and thus significantly avoided the spectral confusion of the above three land-use classes. As a result, the spectral signatures of the three urban land-use classes are more distinguishable in the new composite image than in the original seven-band image as the spectral clusters of the classes are well separated. Through a supervised classification, a principal components analysis, or a logic calculation on the new image, the urban built-up lands were finally extracted with overall accuracy ranging from 91.5 to 98.5 percent. Therefore, the technique is effective and reliable. In addition, the advantages of SAVI over NDVI and MNDWI over NDWI in the urban study are also discussed in this paper."
Seasonal Sensitivity Analysis of Impervious Surface Estimation with Satellite Imagery,"Wu, Changshan; Yuan, Fei",pp. 1393-1401(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000012/art00007;jsessionid=1n9j3wm5823w8.x-ic-live-03,"Numerous approaches have been developed to quantify the distribution of impervious surfaces using remote sensing technologies. Most of these approaches have been applied to data from a single time period, typically in the summer season (June to September). Presently, it is not clear whether there is an optimal time for impervious surface estimation with these methods. In this paper, the seasonal sensitivity of impervious surface estimation is examined. In particular, Landsat TM/ETM+ imagery for four different seasons has been acquired for the environs of Franklin County, Ohio. Two impervious surface estimation methods, spectral mixture analysis and regression modeling, are used to test for seasonal variations. Results indicate that the summer image provides better accuracy with the spectral mixture analysis method, while consistent accuracies are obtained for all four seasons with regression modeling."

The test is pertinent considering that the Gi is generally considered more capable of identifying clusters of points with similar attributes. We quantify the impact of varying distance thresholds on the classification product and demonstrate how well the Gi identified cold and hot spots in comparison to Geary’s C. The exercise also provides a rule of thumb for effectively measuring spatial association in connection to adjacency. We are able to support existing literature that measuring local variability improves classification over spectral information alone. The results, however, neither confirm nor deny the challenge on whether measuring cold and hot spots rather than just spatial association improves classification accuracy."

The system consists of the following subsystems: (a) image acquisition, (b) positioning, (c) image point referencing, (d) spatial object extraction, and, (e) visualization. This paper addresses parts of this work (the first three subsystems) in order to demonstrate the flexibility of this approach to software design."

Automated terrain extraction is becoming a standard capability implemented into photogrammetric software. This paper focuses on digital surface model (DSM) generation from high-resolution satellite imagery (HRSI) using three COTS systems, SOCET SET®, Z/I Imaging, and Imagine®OrthoBASE, which each have their own image matching strategy. By generating DSMs of a test field diverse in land-cover, we assess the performance of the COTS terrain extraction methodologies. In checkpoints favorable to image matching, accuracy to a few meters in height can be achieved from COTS generated DSMs, however the isolated points are unlikely to be representative of the entire scene. Therefore, we look to alternative sources of control, such as the newly available DLR- and NASA-generated SRTM DEMs. A comparison to X-band SRTM DEMs demonstrated that height RMSE values range from 4 to 9 metres, though most of this uncertainty is attributed to the SRTM data."
Weighting Function Alternatives for a Subpixel Allocation Model,"Makido, Yasuyo; Shortridge, Ashton",pp. 1233-1240(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000011/art00002;jsessionid=913c3g2g4plas.x-ic-live-02,"This study investigates the “pixel-swapping” optimization algorithm proposed by Atkinson for predicting subpixel land-cover distribution. Two limitations of this method are assessed: the arbitrary spatial range value and the arbitrary exponential model for characterizing spatial autocorrelation. Various alternative weighting functions are evaluated. For this assessment, two different simulation models are employed to develop spatially autocorrelated binary class raster maps. These rasters are then resampled to generate sets of representative medium-resolution class maps. Prior to conducting the subpixel allocation, the relationship between cell resolution and spatial autocorrelation, as measured by Moran’sI, is evaluated. It is discovered that the form of this relationship depends upon the simulation model. For all tested weighting functions (Nearest Neighbor, Gaussian, Exponential, and IDW), the pixel swapping method increased classification accuracy compared with the initial random allocation of subpixels. Nearest Neighbor allocation performs as well as the more complex models of spatial structure."
Comprehensive Analysis of Sensor Modeling Alternatives for High Resolution Imaging Satellites,"Habib, Ayman; Shin, Sung Woong; Kim, Kyungok; Kim, Changjae; Bang, Ki-In; Kim, Eui-Myoung; Lee, Dong-Cheon",pp. 1241-1251(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000011/art00003;jsessionid=913c3g2g4plas.x-ic-live-02,"High-resolution imaging satellites are a valuable and cost effective data acquisition tool for a variety of mapping and GIS applications such as topographic mapping, map updating, orthophoto generation, environmental monitoring, and change detection. Sensor modeling that describes the mathematical relationship between corresponding scene and object coordinates is a prerequisite procedure prior to manipulating the acquired imagery from such systems for mapping purposes. Rigorous and approximate sensor models are the two alternatives for describing the mathematics of the involved imaging process. The former explicitly involves the internal and external characteristics of the imaging sensor to faithfully represent the geometry of the scene formation. On the other hand, approximate modeling can be divided into two categories. The first category simplifies the rigorous model after making some assumptions about the system’s trajectory and/or object space. Gupta and Hartley’s model, parallel projection, self-calibrating direct linear transformation, and modified parallel projection are examples of this category. Other approximate models are based on empirical formulation of the scene-to-ground mathematical relationship. This category includes among others, the well-known Rational Function Model (RFM). This paper addresses several aspects of sensor modeling. Namely, it deals with the expected accuracy from rigorous modeling of imaging satellites as it relates to the number of available ground control points, comparative analysis of approximate and rigorous sensor models, robustness of the reconstruction process against biases in the available sensor characteristics, and impact of incorporating multi-source imagery in a single triangulation mechanism. Following a brief theoretical background, these issues will be presented through experimental results from real datasets captured by satellite and aerial imaging platforms."
Orthogonal Polynomials Supported by Region Growing Segmentation for the Extraction of Terrain from Lidar Data,"Akel, Nizar Abo; Filin, Sagi; Doytsher, Yerach",pp. 1253-1266(14),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000011/art00004;jsessionid=913c3g2g4plas.x-ic-live-02,"Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) systems supply a massive amount points in 3D space with no semantic information helping knowing the objects they represent. To identify points that were reflected from the terrain, numerous algorithms have been developed in recent years. Many of them apply local operators that tend to face difficulties with complex scenes while their performance also varies between landscapes. In this paper, we present a filtering method that integrates a global approach using orthogonal polynomials with a local one that is region-based. The algorithm makes use of only a few parameters, and no fine-tuning is required between landscapes. Applying the algorithm over areas with varying topography and objects such as bridges, tunnels, and complex building, shows an improved performance compared to results obtained by others. This improvement is reflected in a lower than usual rate of misclassification errors for data acquired over different landscapes."
Line-of-Sight Vector Adjustment Model for Geopositioning of SPOT-5 Stereo Images,"Jung, Hyung-Sup; Kim, Sang-Wan; Won, Joong-Sun; Lee, Dong-Cheon",pp. 1267-1276(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000011/art00005;jsessionid=913c3g2g4plas.x-ic-live-02,"We formulate and present a new geopositioning method for SPOT-5 High-Resolution Geometric (HRG) stereo images, named the line-of-sight (LOS) vector adjustment model. It is applicable to satellites that move along a well-defined close-to-circular elliptical orbit with a predicted orbit close to true. SPOT-5 satisfies these requirements because it has the improved capability of providing accurate satellite attitude and a look angle for each detector. The method’s core idea is that only the LOS vector was adjusted when correcting the geometric distortion of SPOT-5 imagery. One advantage of this method is that it achieves high geopositioning accuracy with a limited number of ground control points (GCPs). Although a minimum of three GCPs is needed for processing, a test result satisfied the accuracy requirement within one pixel of a SPOT-5 panchromatic image even with only three GCPs. The performance in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) improved as the number of GCPs increased. Five GCPs were found to be the optimal number in the practical application of the LOS vector adjustment model. Using five GCPs, the RMSEs were 0.48 m and 0.64 m in planimetry and height, respectively. The test results indicate that the proposed method is superior to the bundle adjustment method for the geopositioning of SPOT-5 HRG stereo images."

To date, terrestrial laser scanning offers 3D input data which are suitable for surface generation but are lacking in photo-realistic appearance. Texture for scanned surfaces can be provided by orthophotos generated from photographs that are acquired from almost the same viewpoint as the incident laser beam. However, the creation of an orthophoto using typical photogrammetric procedures requires the representation of the scanned surface with a triangulated mesh which cannot be created automatically in all cases. In this paper, a new method for automatic orthophoto generation from unorganized point clouds is presented. In the proposed methodology, the acquisition of accurate height information is directly derived from the point cloud without the prior requirement of a triangulated mesh. Analysis of experimental data with large height variations demonstrates the success of the algorithm which produces an orthophoto in near real-time. Issues on the performance of the method are also discussed."

The results are evaluated based on both visual evaluation and a quantitative analysis, by using several assessing parameters and a new evaluation method: the profile intensity curve. Third, as an application of the fused images, they are applied for recognition and identification of features in urban area. The quantitative analysis demonstrates that four-band wavelet transformation method provides improved fused images."

In this study, we attempt to compare the spectral characteristics of forest vegetation in moderate drought condition observed by laboratory measurement and satellite hyperspectral image data. Spectral reflectance data were measured from detached pine needles and oak leaves in the laboratory with a spectroradiometer. Canopy reflectance spectra of the same species were collected from temperate forest stands with dense canopy conditions using EO-1 Hyperion imaging spectrometer data obtained during the moderate drought season in 2001, and then compared with those obtained in the normal precipitation season of 2002. The relationship between leaf-level spectral reflectance and leaf water content was the clearest at the shortwave infrared (SWIR) regions. However, the canopy-level spectral characteristics of forest stands did not quite correspond with the leaf-level reflectance spectra. Further, four water-related spectral indices (WI, NDWI, MSI, and NDII) developed mainly with leaf-level reflectance were not very effective to be used with the canopy-level reflectance in dense forest condition. Forest canopy spectra under moderate drought status may be more influenced by canopy foliage mass, rather than by canopy moisture level."

However, the noise impedes these data from being further analyzed and used. In this paper, a wavelet-based method is used to remove the contaminated data from time-series observations, which can effectively maintain the temporal pattern and approximate the “true” signals. The method is composed of two steps: (a), time-series values are linearly interpolated with the help of quality flags and the blue band, and (b), time series are decomposed into different scales and the highest correlation among several adjacent scales is used, which is more robust and objective than the threshold-based method. Our objective was to reduce noise in MODIS NDVI, LAI, and Albedo time-series data and to compare this technique with the BISE algorithm, Fourier-based fitting method, and the Savitzky-Golay filter method. The results indicate that our newly developed method enhances the ability to remove noise in all three time-series data products."

Using their results, a range of vegetation indices was used as predictors for grassland biomass. Results from the band shaving showed that one band in the near-infrared region from 859 to 1,006 nm and one in the red-edge region from 668 to 776 nm used in the weighted difference vegetation index (WDVI) had the best predictive power, explaining 61 percent of grassland biomass variation. Indices based on short-wave infrared bands performed worse. Results could subsequently be applied to larger spatial extents using a high-resolution airborne digital camera (for example, Vexcel’s UltraCam™)."

The historical yield data and long time-series NDVI derived from AVHRR and MODIS are used to develop the models. A new procedure is developed to train the ANN model using the SCE-UA optimization algorithm.

The new algorithms can effectively train ANN models, and the prediction accuracy can be as high as 85 percent."
Increasing Gross Primary Production (GPP) in the Urbanizing Landscapes of Southeastern Michigan,"Zhao, Tingting; Brown, Daniel G.; Bergen, Kathleen M.",pp. 1159-1167(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000010/art00005;jsessionid=1pil24e033qjd.x-ic-live-03,"In order to understand the impact of urbanizing landscapes on regional gross primary production (GPP), we analyzed changes in land-cover and annual GPP over an urban-rural gradient in ten Southeastern Michigan counties between 1991 and 1999. Landsat and AVHRR remote sensing data and biophysical parameters corresponding to three major land-cover types (i.e., built-up, tree, and crop/grass) were used to estimate the annual GPP synthesized during the growing season of 1991 and 1999. According to the numbers of households reported by the U.S. Census in 1990 and 2000, the area settled at urban (>1 housing unit acre–1), suburban (0.1 to 1 housing units acre–1), and exurban (0.025 to 0.1 housing units acre–1) densities expanded, while the area settled at rural (<0.025 housing units acre–1) densities reduced. GPP in this urbanizing area, however, was found to increase from 1991 to 1999. Increasing annual GPP was attributed mainly to a region-wide increase in tree cover in 1999. In addition, the estimated annual GPP and its changes between 1991 and 1999 were found to be spatially heterogeneous. The exurban category (including constantly exurban and exurban converted from rural) was associated with the highest annual GPP as well as an intensified increase in GPP. Our study indicates that low-density exurban development, characterized by large proportions of vegetation, can be more productive in the form of GPP than the agricultural land it replaces. Therefore, low-density development of agricultural areas in U.S. Midwest, comprising significant fractions of highly productive tree and grass species, may not degrade, but enhance, the regional CO2uptake from the atmosphere."

In this study, based on Landsat TM/ETM+ data and meteorological data, evapotranspiration in Beijing area on 17 April 2001, 12 April 2002, 06 July 2004, 06 May 2005, and 22 May 2005 were calculated by an estimation model of regional evapotranspiration. Comparisons of energy balance components (net radiation, soil heat flux, sensible and latent heat flux) with measured fluxes were made integrating the remotely sensed fluxes by the footprint model. Results show that latent heat flux estimates (adjusted for closure) with errors (MBE±RMSE) 26.47±42.54 Wm−2, sensible heat flux error of −8.56±23.79 Wm−2, net radiation error of 25.16±50.87 Wm−2and soil heat flux error of 10.68±22.81 Wm−2. The better agreement between the estimates and the measurements indicates that the remote sensing model is appropriate for estimating regional evapotranspiration over heterogeneous surfaces. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of evapotranspiration in Beijing area was analyzed."
River Floodplain Vegetation Scenario Development Using Imaging Spectroscopy Derived Products as Input Variables in a Dynamic Vegetation Model,"Schaepman, M.E.; Wamelink, G.W.W.; van Dobben, H.F.; Gloor, M.; Schaepman-Strub, G.; Kooistra, L.; Clevers, J.G.P.W.; Schmidt, A.; Berendse, F.",pp. 1179-1188(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000010/art00007;jsessionid=1pil24e033qjd.x-ic-live-03,"River floodplains are becoming increasingly subject to multifunctional land-use. In this contribution, we are linking imaging spectrometer derived products with a dynamic vegetation model to improve the simulation and evaluation of scenarios for a river floodplain in the Netherlands. In particular, we are using airborne HyMap imaging spectrometer data to derive Leaf Area Index (LAI), spatial distribution of Plant Functional Types (PFT), and model dominant species abundances as input for the ecological model. We use the dynamic vegetation model (DVM) SMART2-SUMO to simulate vegetation succession under scenarios of changing abiotic conditions and management regimes. SMART2 is a soil chemical model whereas SUMO describes plant competition and resulting vegetation succession. We validate all remote sensing derived products and the DVM calibration independently using extensive field sampling. We conclude that the dynamic vegetation models can be successfully initialized using imaging spectrometer data at currently unprecedented accuracy. However, all efforts undertaken for validation in this contribution may significantly exceed capacities for national or continental scale application of the proposed method."
High Resolution Elevation Data Derived from Stereoscopic CORONA Imagery with Minimal Ground Control,"Galiatsatos, Nikolaos; Donoghue, Daniel N.M.; Philip, Graham",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000009/art00001;jsessionid=15h6jwoj7h4nc.x-ic-live-02,"The first space mission to provide stereoscopic imagery of the Earth’s surface was from the American CORONA spy satellite program from which it is possible to generate Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). CORONA imagery and derived DEMs are of most value in areas where conventional topographic maps are of poor quality, but the problem has been that until recently, it was difficult to assess their accuracy. This paper presents a methodology to create a high quality DEM from CORONA imagery using horizontal ground control derived from Ikonos space imagery and vertical ground control from map-based contour lines. Such DEMs can be produced without the need for field-based ground control measurements which is an advantage in many parts of world where ground surveying is difficult. Knowledge of CORONA image distortions, satellite geometry, ground resolution, and film scanning are important factors that can affect the DEM extraction process. A study area in Syria is used to demonstrate the method, and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data is used to perform quantitative and qualitative accuracy assessment of the automatically extracted DEM. The SRTM data has enormous importance for validating the quality of CORONA DEMs, and so, unlocking the potential of a largely untapped part of the archive. We conclude that CORONA data can produce unbiased, high-resolution DEM data which may be valuable for researchers working in countries where topographic data is difficult to obtain."
Optimizing the High-Pass Filter Addition Technique for Image Fusion,"Gangkofner, Ute G.; Pradhan, Pushkar S.; Holcomb, Derrold W.",pp. 1107-1118(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000009/art00002;jsessionid=15h6jwoj7h4nc.x-ic-live-02,"Pixel-level image fusion combines complementary image data, most commonly low spectral-high spatial resolution data with high spectral-low spatial resolution optical data. The presented study aims at refining and improving the High-Pass Filter Additive (HPFA) fusion method towards a tunable and versatile, yet standardized image fusion tool. HPFA is an image fusion method in the spatial domain, which inserts structural and textural details of the higher resolution image into the lower resolution image, whose spectral properties are thereby largely retained. Using various input image pairs, workable sets of HPFA parameters have been derived with regard to high-pass filter properties and injection weights. Improvements are the standardization of the HPFA parameters over a wide range of image resolution ratios and the controlled trade-off between resulting image sharpness and spectral properties. The results are evaluated visually and by spectral and spatial metrics in comparison with wavelet-based image fusion results as a benchmark."
Photogrammetric Modeling of Linear Features with Generalized Point Photogrammetry,"Zhang, Zuxun; Zhang, Yongjun; Zhang, Jianging; Zhang, Hongwei",pp. 1119-1127(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000009/art00003;jsessionid=15h6jwoj7h4nc.x-ic-live-02,"Most current digital photogrammetric workstations are based on feature points. Curved features are quite difficult to be modeled because they cannot be treated as feature points. The focus of the paper is on the photogrammetric modeling of space linear features. In general, lines and curves can be represented by a series of connected points, so called, generalized points in the paper. Different from all existing models, only one collinearity equation is used for each point on the linear curve, which makes the mathematical model very simple. Hereby, the key of generalized point photogrammetry is that all kinds of features are treated as generalized points to use either x or y collinearity equation. A significant difference between generalized point photogrammetry and conventional point photogrammetry is that image features are not necessarily exact conjugates. The exact conjugacy between image features and/or the correspondence between space and image feature are established during bundle block adjustment. Photogrammetric modeling of several space linear features is discussed. Sub-pixel precision has been achieved for both exterior orientation and 3D modeling of linear features, which verifies the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed approach."
A Photogrammetric Correction Procedure for Light Refraction Effects at a Two-Medium Boundary,"Murase, Toshimi; Tanaka, Miho; Tani, Tomomi; Miyashita, Yuko; Ohkawa, Naoto; Ishiguro, Satoshi; Suzuki, Yasuhiro; Kayanne, Hajime; Yamano, Hiroya",pp. 1129-1136(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000009/art00004;jsessionid=15h6jwoj7h4nc.x-ic-live-02,"We report on a correction procedure for light refraction effects at a two-medium boundary, based on the stereo view of underwater objects, to estimate underwater topography using photogrammetry. Because theoretically, no solution exists for photogrammetrically observed positions when the incident angles of light rays from an underwater object of interest to two cameras are different; approximation in solving the positions is needed. We show the feasibility of the approximation theoretically by examining the horizontal differences between the observed and true positions when objects are in line along an airplane track or when the incident angles are identical. We applied the procedure to bathymetric mapping of Shiraho Reef, southwest Japan, using a stereo-pair of aerial photographs. Comparison of the corrected depths with measured depths at 658 points showed a mean error and standard deviation of 20.06 m and 0.36 m, respectively, for measured depth range of −3.4 m to −0.2 m."
Significance of Altitude and Posting Density on Lidar-derived Elevation Accuracy on Hazardous Waste Sites,"García-Quijano, María J.; Jensen, John.

Both missions provided adequate elevation estimates (low-altitude RMSEz≈6 cm; high-altitude RMSEz≈14 cm.) A quantitative comparison was performed to determine how decreasing platform altitude and increasing lidar posting density affected the vertical elevation accuracy. Higher posting densities did not significantly improve the vertical accuracy of lidar-derived elevation data. Conversely, acquiring the lidar-derived elevation data at a lower altitude had a significant influence on the mean vertical error present in the lidar-derived elevation data. Differences in mean vertical elevation error between the low-and high-altitude lidar data collection missions were primarily due to a systematic underestimation bias present in the high-altitude lidar data."
Shaping Polyhedral Buildings by the Fusion of Vector Maps and Lidar Point Clouds,"Chen, Liang-Chien; Teo, Tee-Ann; Kuo, Chih-Yi; Rau, Jiann-Yeou",pp. 1147-1157(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000009/art00006;jsessionid=15h6jwoj7h4nc.x-ic-live-02,"We integrate lidar point clouds and large-scale vector maps to perform building modeling. The proposed scheme comprises three major steps: (a) the preprocessing of lidar point clouds and vector maps, (b) roof analysis, and (c) building reconstruction. During the preprocessing stage, the building polygons are first obtained from the polylines, followed by the selections of lidar points in the building polygons. An irregular triangulated network is then built to represent the facets. The segmentation of planar facets for roof analysis is implemented by examining the patch size and the facet orientation. The interior 3D roof edges are then determined from the intersection of the roof planes. Finally, the building models are reconstructed through regularization. Two sample sites are tested for the purposes of validation. The experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme allows for high fidelity and accuracy, provided that the point cloud density is enough."
Object-based Classification of High Resolution SAR Images for Within Field Homogeneous Zone Delineation,"Liu, Jiangui; Pattey, Elizabeth; Nolin, Michel C.",pp. 1159-1168(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000009/art00007;jsessionid=15h6jwoj7h4nc.x-ic-live-02,"Delineating management zones is important in agriculture for implementing site-specific practices. We delineated within-field homogeneous zones over a corn and a wheat field using high spatial resolution multi-temporal airborne C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery with an object-based fuzzy k-means classification approach. Image objects were generated by a segmentation procedure implemented in eCognition®software, and were classified as basic processing units using SAR data. Results were evaluated using analysis of variance and variance reduction of soil electrical conductivity (EC), leaf area index (LAI), and crop yield. The object-based approach provided better results than a pixel-based approach. The variance reduction in LAI, and soil EC varied with SAR acquisition time and incidence angle. Although the variance reduction of yield was not as significant as that of LAI and EC, average yield among the delineated zones were different in most cases. The SAR data classification produced interpretable patterns of soil and crop spatial variability, which can be used to infer within-field management zones."
Optimizing Image Resolution to Maximize the Accuracy of Hard Classification,"McCloy, K.R.; Bøcher, P.K.",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000008/art00001;jsessionid=39vbpiujofusd.x-ic-live-01,"There are three strategies by which the accuracy of classification can be improved after the imagery that will be used for the classification has been chosen. These are to improve the definition of the class decision surfaces, to maximize the between class distances, and to reduce the within class variances. This paper reports on work done to investigate the relationship between classification accuracy and within class variances, where generally accepted measures of accuracy derived from the Confusion Matrix are used as the indicators of classification accuracy. This paper shows that the within class variances are a function of image resolution, and it provides a mechanism based on the Average Local Variance (ALV) function to find the resolution that will yield the highest relative within field classification accuracy by minimizing the within class variances"
The Importance of Scale in Object-based Mapping of Vegetation Parameters with Hyperspectral Imagery,"Addink, Elisabeth A.; de Jong, Steven M.; Pebesma, Edzer J.",pp. 905-912(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000008/art00002;jsessionid=39vbpiujofusd.x-ic-live-01,"In recent years, object-oriented image analysis has been widely adopted by the remote sensing community. Much attention has been given to its application, while the fundamental issue of scale, here characterized by spatial object-definition, seems largely neglected.In the case of vegetation parameters like aboveground biomass and leaf area index (LAI), fundamental objects are individual trees or shrubs, each of which has a specific value. Their spatial extent, however, does not match pixels in size and shape, nor does it fit the requirements of regional studies. Estimation of vegetation parameters consequently demands larger observation units, like vegetation patches, which are better represented by variably shaped objects than by square pixels.This study aims to investigate optimal object definition for biomass and LAI. We have data from 243 field plots in our test site in southern France. They cover a vegetation range fromlandestogarriguetomaquis, which is considered to be the climax vegetation in the area. A HyMap image covers the area.The image is subjected to a Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) transformation, after which it is segmented with ten different heterogeneities. The result is ten object sets, each having a different mean object size. These object sets are combined with the original image with the mean band values serving as object attributes.Field observations are linked to the corresponding objects for each object set. Using Ridge regression, relations between field observations and spectral values are identified. The prediction error is determined for each object set by cross validation. The overall lowest prediction error indicates the optimal heterogeneity for segmentation.Results show that the scale of prediction affects prediction accuracy, that increasing the object size yields an optimum in prediction accuracy, and that aboveground biomass and LAI can be associated with different optimal object sizes. Furthermore, it is shown that the accuracy of parameter estimation is higher for object-oriented analysis than for per-pixel analysis."
Integrating Fine Scale Information in Super-resolution Land-cover Mapping,"Boucher, Alexandre; Kyriakidis, Phaedon C.",pp. 913-921(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000008/art00003;jsessionid=39vbpiujofusd.x-ic-live-01,"Super-resolution or sub-pixel class mapping is the task of providing fine spatial resolution maps of, for example, land-cover classes, from satellite sensor measurements obtained at a coarser spatial resolution. Often, the only information available consists of coarse class fraction data, typically obtained through spectral unmixing. This paper shows how to integrate, in addition to such coarse fractions, class labels at a set of fine pixels obtained independent of the satellite sensor measurements. The integration of such fine spatial resolution information is achieved within the Indicator Kriging formalism in either a prediction or simulation mode. The spatial dissimilarity or texture of class labels at the fine (target) resolution is quantified in a non-parametric way from an analog scene using a set of experimental indicator semivariogram maps. The output of the proposed procedure consists of maps of probabilities of class occurrence, or of a series of simulated class maps characterizing the inherent spatial uncertainty in the super-resolution mapping process."
Variability in Soft Classification Prediction and its implications for Sub-pixel Scale Change Detection and Super Resolution Mapping,"Foody, Giles M.; Doan, H.T.X.",pp. 923-933(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000008/art00004;jsessionid=39vbpiujofusd.x-ic-live-01,"The impact of intra-class spectral variability on the estimation of sub-pixel land-cover class composition with a linear mixture model is explored. It is shown that the nature of intra-class variation present has a marked impact on the accuracy of sub-pixel class composition estimation, as it violates the assumption that a class can be represented by a single spectral endmember. It is suggested that a distribution of possible class compositions can be derived from pixels instead of a single class composition prediction. This distribution provides a richer indication of possible sub-pixel class compositions and highlights a limitation for super-resolution mapping. Moreover, the class composition distribution information may be used to derive different scenarios of changes when used in a post-classification comparison type approach to change detection. This latter issue is illustrated with an example of forest cover change in Brazil from Landsat TM data."
Assessing Alternatives for Modeling the Spatial Distribution of Multiple Land-cover Classes at Sub-pixel Scales,"Makido, Yasuyo; Shortridge, Ashton; Messina, Joseph P.",pp. 935-943(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000008/art00005;jsessionid=39vbpiujofusd.x-ic-live-01,"We introduce and evaluate three methods for modeling the spatial distribution of multiple land-cover classes at sub-pixel scales: (a) sequential categorical swapping, (b) simultaneous categorical swapping, and (c) simulated annealing. Method 1, a modification of a binary pixel-swapping algorithm, allocates each class in turn to maximize internal spatial autocorrelation. Method 2 simultaneously examines all pairs of cell-class combinations within a pixel to determine the most appropriate pairs of sub-pixels to swap. Method 3 employs simulated annealing to swap cells. While convergence is relatively slow, Method 3 offers increased flexibility. Each method is applied to a classified Landsat-7 ETM dataset that has been resampled to a spatial resolution of 210 m, and evaluated for accuracy performance and computational efficiency."
Scaling Field Data to Calibrate and Validate Moderate Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Models,"Baccini, A.; Friedl, M.A.; Woodcock, C.E.; Zhu, Z.",pp. 945-954(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000008/art00006;jsessionid=39vbpiujofusd.x-ic-live-01,"Validation and calibration are essential components of nearly all remote sensing-based studies. In both cases, ground measurements are collected and then related to the remote sensing observations or model results. In many situations, and particularly in studies that use moderate resolution remote sensing, a mismatch exists between the sensor’s field of view and the scale at which in situ measurements are collected. The use of in situ measurements for model calibration and validation, therefore, requires a robust and defensible method to spatially aggregate ground measurements to the scale at which the remotely sensed data are acquired. This paper examines this challenge and specifically considers two different approaches for aggregating field measurements to match the spatial resolution of moderate spatial resolution remote sensing data: (a) landscape stratification; and (b) averaging of fine spatial resolution maps. The results show that an empirically estimated stratification based on a regression tree method provides a statistically defensible and operational basis for performing this type of procedure."

We designed a classification scheme of two levels with level I including general classes and level II including more specific classes. Classification shows that the HS data does not produce better results than the MS data when we directly applied a Mahalanobis distance (MD) classifier.We tested a number of feature reduction and extraction algorithms for the HS image. These algorithms include principal component analysis (PCA), segmented PCA (SEGPCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), segmented LDA (SEGLDA), penalized discriminant analysis (PDA) and segmented PDA (SEGPDA). Feature reductions were all followed by an MD classifier for image classification. With SEGPDA, SEGLDA, PDA, and LDA, similar accuracies were achieved while a segmentation-based approach we proposed (SEGPDA or SEGLDA) greatly improved computation efficiency. They all outperformed SEGPCA and PCA by 4 to 5 percent (level II) and 1 to 3 percent (level I) in classification accuracy.For level II classification, overall accuracies obtained by using the features extracted from the HS image were 2 to 3 percent greater than those obtained with the MS image. For various vegetation class and impervious land use categories, the HS data consistently produced better results than the MS data. For level I classification, the HS image generated a thematic map that is <0.01 greater in kappa coefficient comparing to the MS image. When we collapsed the level II classification map to a level I map, 5 percent (HS) to 7 percent (MS) improvements were achieved."
Patterns in Forest Clearing Along the Appalachian Trail Corridor,"Potere, David; Woodcock, Curtis E.; Schneider, Annemarie; Ozdogan, Mutlu; Baccini, Alessandro",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000007/art00001;jsessionid=1ifumvp4q24cd.x-ic-live-01,"Forest clearing in the vicinity of the Appalachian Trail National Park undermines the Trail’s value as a wilderness retreat for millions of annual hikers. We estimate that 75,000 hectares of forest were lost to clearing during the decade of the 1990s inside a 16 km-wide corridor centered on the Trail. This loss represents 2.45 percent of forests within 8 km of the 3,500 km-long trail. Managed forest harvests in northern New England accounted for 76.8 percent of forest clearing. The factor most closely related to forest clearing is land ownership: only 0.29 percent of protected forests were cleared, while unprotected and managed forests were cleared at rates of 2.05 percent and 4.03 percent, respectively. A combination of boosted decision tree classifiers, multitemporal Kauth-Thomas transforms and the GeoCover Landsat dataset enabled a single, un-funded analyst to rapidly map land-cover change at 28.5-meter resolution within a 3.8 million hectare study area that spanned 16 Landsat scenes."
Impact of Lidar Nominal Post-spacing on DEM Accuracy and Flood Zone Delineation,"Raber, George T.; Jensen, John R.; Hodgson, Michael E.; Tullis, Jason A.; Davis, Bruce A.; Berglund, Judith",pp. 793-804(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000007/art00002;jsessionid=1ifumvp4q24cd.x-ic-live-01,"Lidar data have become a major source of digital terrain information for use in many applications including hydraulic modeling and flood plane mapping. Based on established relationships between sampling intensity and error, nominal post-spacing likely contributes significantly to the error budget. Post-spacing is also a major cost factor during lidar data collection. This research presents methods for establishing a relationship between nominal post-spacing and its effects on hydraulic modeling for flood zone delineation. Lidar data collected at a low post-spacing (approximately 1 to 2 m) over a piedmont study area in North Carolina was systematically decimated to simulate datasets with sequentially higher post-spacing values. Using extensive first-order ground survey information, the accuracy of each DEM derived from these lidar datasets was assessed and reported. Hydraulic analyses were performed utilizing standard engineering practices and modeling software (HEC-RAS). All input variables were held constant in each model run except for the topographic information from the decimated lidar datasets. The results were compared to a hydraulic analysis performed on the un-decimated reference dataset. The sensitivity of the primary model outputs to the variation in nominal post-spacing is reported. The results indicate that base flood elevation does not statistically change over the post-spacing values tested. Conversely, flood zone boundary mapping was found to be sensitive to variations in post-spacing."
Building Boundary Tracing and Regularization from Airborne Lidar Point Clouds,"Sampath, Aparajithan; Shan, Jie",pp. 805-812(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000007/art00003;jsessionid=1ifumvp4q24cd.x-ic-live-01,"Building boundary is necessary for the real estate industry, flood management, and homeland security applications. The extraction of building boundary is also a crucial and difficult step towards generating city models. This study presents an approach to the tracing and regularization of building boundary from raw lidar point clouds. The process consists of a sequence of four steps: separate building and non-building lidar points; segment lidar points that belong to the same building; trace building boundary points; and regularize the boundary. For separation, a slope based 1D bi-directional filter is used. The segmentation step is a region-growing approach. By modifying a convex hull formation algorithm, the building boundary points are traced and connected to form an approximate boundary. In the final step, all boundary points are included in a hierarchical least squares solution with perpendicularity constraints to determine a regularized rectilinear boundary. Our tests conclude that the uncertainty of regularized building boundary tends to be linearly proportional to the lidar point spacing. It is shown that the regularization precision is at 18 percent to 21 percent of the lidar point spacing, and the maximum offset of the determined building boundary from the original lidar points is about the same as the lidar point spacing. Limitation of lidar data resolution and errors in previous filtering processes may cause artefacts in the final regularized building boundary. This paper presents the mathematical and algorithmic formulations along with stepwise illustrations. Results from Baltimore city, Toronto city, and Purdue University campus are evaluated."

ThekNN and CART®classification methods, with the integration of multi-temporal data, performed equally well in the separation of cleared, re-vegetated, and primary forest classes with overall accuracies ranging from 77 percent to 91 percent, with pixel-based CART®classifications resulting in significantly lower variance than all other methods (3.2 percent versus an average of 13.2 percent). Segmentation did not improve classification success over pixel-based methods with the used datasets. Through appropriate band selection methods, multi-temporal bands were chosen in 38 of 44 total classifications, strongly suggesting the utility of inter-annual, multi-temporal data for the given classes and region. The land-cover maps from this study allow for an accurate annualized analysis of land-cover and landscape change in the region."

Towards this end, we explore the feasibility of using spectral mixture analysis to discriminate the distribution and abundance of two important forest species at the Bartlett Experimental Forest, New Hampshire. Using hyper-spectral image data and simulated broadband sensor data, we used spectral unmixing to quantify the abundance of sugar maple and American beech, as opposed to the more conventional approach of detecting presence or absence of discrete species classes. Stronger linear relationships were demonstrated between predicted and measured abundance for hyperspectral than broadband sensor data: R2= 0.49 (RMSE = 0.09) versus R2= 0.16 (RMSE = 0.19) for sugar maple; R2= 0.36 (RMSE = 0.18) versus R2= 0.24 (RMSE = 0.33) for beech. These results suggest that spectrally unmixing hyperspectral data to estimate species abundances holds promise for a variety of ecological studies."

For certain procedures such as regression, an alternative SNR (SNRvar), the ratio of the variance in the signal to the variance in the noise, is potentially more informative and useful. In this paper, the GS method was modified to estimate the SNRvar, referred to as the SNRvar(GS). Specifically, the sill variance c of the fitted variogram model was used to estimate the variance of the signal component and the nugget variance c0of the fitted model was used to estimate the variance of the noise. The assumptions required in this estimation are presented. The SNRvar(GS) was estimated using the modified GS method for six different land-covers and a range of wavelengths to explore its properties. The SNR*var(GS)was found to vary as a function of both wavelength and land-cover. The SNR*var(GS)represents a useful statistic that should be estimated and presented for different land-cover types and even per-pixel using a local moving window kernel."
Towards GIS-enabled Virtual Public Meeting Space for Public Participation,"Li, Songnian; Guo, Xincheng; Ma, Xiaohong; Chang, Zheng",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000006/art00001;jsessionid=c28g5vlekvpi.x-ic-live-02,"The by-laws of many municipalities and local governments require certain level of public participation in their planning, decision-making processes. One of the common practices in Canada or elsewhere around the world is to hold public meetings, during which the proposed developments are explained and discussed, and public opinions are collected. The problems associated with existing practices are threefold: insufficient access to the information required for public input, lack of effective means of participation other than attending public meetings, and difficulties in explaining spatial concepts during the debate. Using the municipal environmental assessment (EA) process as the application context, this paper presents our effort on developing an integrated online GIS-enabled virtual public meeting space. The system provides a new way of engaging the public and addressing their concerns by facilitating information access, understanding of planning study, and proactive participation in public meetings and in overall municipal class EA process."
Sensible Field Computing,"Wagtendonk, Alfred J.; De Jeu, Richard A.M.",pp. 651-662(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000006/art00002;jsessionid=c28g5vlekvpi.x-ic-live-02,"Traditional analogue field methods are increasingly becoming a limiting factor in the workflow of computerized research projects. At the same time, the potential of mobile GIS and other mobile computing methods to support better and more efficient scientific data collection is widely acknowledged. There seems, however, to be little scientific proof for the added value and successful continuation of these methods beyond the pilot stage. In particular, the diversity and unique mobility characteristics of fieldwork pose specific difficulties for the design, implementation, and support of these methods. This paper offers a simpleex ante/ex postevaluation framework to help researchers in estimating the added value of a mobile computing method. The application of this framework is exemplified with an archaeological case study and demonstrates that its use can result in a more comprehensive view of the potential and actual benefits of applying specific mobile computing methods in scientific fieldwork."
Pattern Matching for Heterogeneous Geodata Sources Using Attributed Relational Graph and Probabilistic Relaxation,"Yi, Shanzhen; Huang, Bo; Wang, Cheng",pp. 663-670(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000006/art00003;jsessionid=c28g5vlekvpi.x-ic-live-02,"Information retrieval and intelligent search among heterogeneous data sources still continue to be challenging tasks. In this study, an attributed relational graph was employed to model the semantic information of heterogeneous geodata sources. Based on the attributed relational graphs, probabilistic relaxation was employed for pattern matching between different data sources. The initial probability and compatibility coefficients were calculated based on the combined evidence from semi-structured geodata sources and the characteristics of discrete and categorical variables. Experiments on automatic pattern matching were carried out and the results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach in element mapping between heterogeneous data sources."

This paper presents the results of efforts made at the Mapping and GIS Laboratory of The Ohio State University (OSU) for the development and application of a web-based GIS, the OSU Mars WEBGIS, to support rover localization (i.e., position determination) and topographic mapping activities of the mission. Global and local spatial information and map products of the two landing sites are provided through the WEBGIS. The products include mosaics, orthophotos and digital terrain models (DTMs) derived from orbital and rover images; ground information is supplied as traverse maps, traverse profiles and 3D coordinates, slope maps, and energy index maps; analysis tools are also developed for effective visualization and exploration of the spatial information and products. The system has been successfully applied to the 2003 MER mission and has the potential for future Mars landed missions such as the 2009 Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission."

This flourishing of geospatial resources also added to the problem of geospatial heterogeneity. Interoperability research and implementation are needed for advancement in potential solutions to integrate and interoperate these widely dispersed geospatial resources. We propose the Spatial Web Portal architecture to integrate and interoperate geospatial resources. The architecture leverages web-based computing, spatial web services, and web fragments to integrate geospatial metadata, data, analysis, and presentation, through distributed portlets: (1) Spatial web services are adopted to interoperate geospatial components. (2) Web portals are adopted to integrate web pages from web fragments generated by portlets. (3) W3C recommendations are adopted to provide access to remote portlets delegating geospatial components. (4) Java community specifications are adopted to facilitate the development and distribution of portlets. NASA’ Earth Science Gateway (ESG) is designed and developed as an example to test the proposed architecture in sharing earth observations, simulations, and other geospatial resources. The proposed architecture and example system provide (a) a tested mechanism for interoperating geospatial resources at different levels, (b) an environment to test new interoperable concepts, and (c) a platform to support heterogeneous-geospatial-resource based applications of national and global significance, such as the Global Earth Observing System of Systems (GEOSS) applications."

Challenges and problems in dealing with the metadata conceptual models, query languages, and communication protocols are analyzed. Proposed federation strategies and the operational federation system are introduced. Our results show that protocol adaptation, query dispatching, query criteria translation, and query results integration are the four main challenges in building a catalogue federation. A mediator-wrapper based approach can be adopted to build a federation service. The OpenGIS Catalogue Service specification can be used to define the internal communication protocols between the federation service and the affiliated catalogue services, and between the federation service and its clients."

Detection and Vectorization of Roads from Lidar Data,"Clode, Simon; Rottensteiner, Franz; Kootsookos, Peter; Zelniker, Emanuel",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000005/art00001;jsessionid=pokd47cal05o.x-ic-live-03,"A method for the automatic detection and vectorization of roads from lidar data is presented. To extract roads from a lidar point cloud, a hierarchical classification technique is used to classify the lidar points progressively into road and non-road points. During the classification process, both intensity and height values are initially used. Due to the homogeneous and consistent nature of roads, a local point density is introduced to finalize the classification. The resultant binary classification is then vectorized by convolving a complex-valued disk named the Phase Coded Disk (PCD) with the image to provide three separate pieces of information about the road. The centerline and width of the road are obtained from the resultant magnitude image while the direction is determined from the corresponding phase image, thus completing the vectorized road model. All algorithms used are described and applied to two urban test sites. Completeness values of 0.88 and 0.79 and correctness values of 0.67 and 0.80 were achieved for the classification phase of the process. The vectorization of the classified results yielded RMS values of 1.56 m and 1.66 m, completeness values of 0.84 and 0.81 and correctness values of 0.75 and 0.80 for two different data sets."

The purpose of the questionnaires and the workshop was to better understand the status of, and needs for training within the lidar community. The results demonstrate that there is a clear need for training within both the end user and service provider sectors of the professional lidar community. It is speculated that although specific training needs differ, in terms of volume the end user community’s need is at least an order of magnitude greater than in the service provider sector. Regarding training priorities, there appears to be some clear stratification between the needs of end users and service providers. In general, practical experience and “hands on” training methods were considered more useful for those entering into lidar related employment, but this perception was not shared by academics. Also, results indicated that “end user applications” were the priority topic in the end user academic and government communities, while in the lidar industry, training priorities were related to more technical and operational topics such as “data processing” and “project management.” Within the lidar project workflow, six areas of responsibility were identified within the end user and service provider sectors (service provider operators, data processors, and project managers; and end user clients, project managers, and data processors), each of which having different training needs. The results of this study are being used by the Applied Geomatics Research Group to develop a suite of lidar training curricula from workshop seminars to industrysponsored project-based internship programs."
A Filtering Strategy for Interest Point Detecting to Improve Repeatability and Information Content,"Zhu, Qing; Wan, Neng; Wu, Bo",pp. 547-553(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000005/art00003;jsessionid=pokd47cal05o.x-ic-live-03,"This paper compares several stereo image interest point detectors with respect to their repeatability and information content through experimental analysis. The Harris-Laplace detector gives better results than other detectors in areas of good texture; however, in areas of poor texture, the Harris-Laplace detector may be not the best choice. A featurerelated filtering strategy is designed for the Harris-Laplace detector (as well as the standard Harris detector) to improve the repeatability and information content for imagery with both good and poor texture: (a) the local information entropy is computed to describe the local feature of the image; and (b) the redundant interest points are filtered according to the interest strength and the local information entropy. After the filtering process, the repeatability and information content of the final interest points are improved, and the mismatching then can be reduced. This conclusion is supported by experimental analysis with actual stereo images."

Three images were evaluated with respect to three aspects: classification accuracy, matched filtering score index, and separability of the five significant rock types in the study area.The results show that the classifications from Hyperion and ASTER data are mostly similar with an overall accuracy of over 85 percent and kappa coefficient 0.81. Due to the presence of more SWIR and thermal bands, the Hyperion and ASTER images can achieve better lithologic mapping than ETM. The assessment of matched filtering score index and the separability also supports these findings. Hyperion can discriminate more similar classes than ASTER and ETM, while the better availability and spatial coverage makes the ASTER sensor more suitable for large-area lithologic mapping."
Use of Landsat ETM and Topographic Data to Characterize Evergreen Understory Communities in Appalachian Deciduous Forests,"Chastain, Jr., Robert A.; Townsend, Philip A.",pp. 563-575(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000005/art00005;jsessionid=pokd47cal05o.x-ic-live-03,"Evergreen understory vegetation was classified using Landsat ETM imagery and ancillary data in two physiographic provinces in the central Appalachian highlands; the Ridge and Valley and the Allegheny Plateau. These evergreen understory communities are dominated by rosebay rhododendron (Rhododendron maximum L.) and mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia L.), which are spatially extensive and ecologically important to the structure and functioning of Appalachian forests. DEM-derived topographic information was integrated with Landsat data to assess its potential to improve classification accuracy, maximum likelihood, and minimum distance, and decision tree classification approaches were tested with these data in a factorial manner. An overall accuracy of 87.1 percent (Khat= .806) was achieved in the Ridge and Valley province by employing a maximum likelihood approach using Landsat data alone, while an 82.9 percent overall accuracy (Khat= .755) was obtained for the Allegheny Plateau employing a hybrid decision tree classification approach with Landsat and topographic data."
An Object-oriented Approach to Urban Forest Mapping in Phoenix,"Walker, Jason S.; Briggs, John M.",pp. 577-583(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000005/art00006;jsessionid=pokd47cal05o.x-ic-live-03,"We present a classification procedure in order to delineate woody vegetation in an arid urban ecosystem using highresolution, true-color aerial photography. We adopted an object-oriented approach due to the physical nature of highresolution photography, in which the objects of interest were typically composed of many pixels. The segmentation process was parameterized to isolate vegetation patches from shrubs to large trees. These objects were then spectrally analyzed for discrimination between woody vegetation and all other objects and a classification scheme developed. Accuracy within subclasses was analyzed and indicated highest accuracy for large, dense vegetation. Error was caused by the following plant typologies: small vegetation, sparse canopy density, and gray vegetation. The outset of this procedure produces a binary matrix where the entire raster set is classified highlighting the elements of the urban forest."

First, we present a web-accessible photographic database that facilitates interactive visualization of multiple rock exposures for geology mapping, and second, the results of analysis of two readily available oblique photogrammetric methods, that have been previously applied to archeological and industrial surveys. These two techniques of high-resolution terrestrial oblique photogrammetry called “block bundle” and “terrain rendering” were tested using the web database, in order to evaluate their precision and accuracy as mapping techniques. The efficiency of the new techniques to support geological mapping is compared to other mapping techniques. The results show that in conditions where highresolution digital elevation and imagery data are available, a web-based terrain rendering technique, combined with a web-accessible photographic database of rock exposures is advantageous to a wide range of geological analyses, including analog modeling of hydrocarbon reservoirs."
A Comparison of Four Common Atmospheric Correction Methods,"Mahiny, Abdolrassoul S.; Turner, Brian J.",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000004/art00001;jsessionid=28nvpou5gnrp8.x-ic-live-03,"Four atmospheric correction methods, two relative and two absolute, were compared in this study. Two of the methods (PIF and RCS) were relative approaches; COST is an absolute image-based method and 6S, an absolute modeling method. The methods were applied to the hazy bands 1 through 4 of a Landsat TM scene of the year 1997, which was being used in a change detection project. The effects of corrections were studied in woodland patches. Three criteria, namely (a) image attributes; (b) image classification results, and (c) landscape metrics, were used for comparing the performance of the correction methods. Average pixel values, dynamic range, and coefficient of variation of bands constituted the first criterion, the area of detected vegetation through image classification was the second criterion, and patch and landscape measures of vegetation the third criterion. Overall, the COST, RCS, and 6S methods performed better than PIF and showed more stable results. The 6S method produced some negative values in bands 2 through 4 due to the unavailability of some data needed in the model. Having to use only a single set of image pixels for normalization in the PIF method and the difficulty of selecting such samples in the study area may be the reasons for its poor performance."
A Rigorous Laboratory Calibration Method for Interior Orientation of an Airborne Linear Push-Broom Camera,"Chen, Tianen; Shibasaki, Ryosuke; Lin, Zongjian",pp. 369-374(6),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000004/art00002;jsessionid=28nvpou5gnrp8.x-ic-live-03,"The linear push-broom camera is one of the most important imaging systems in modern photogrammetry and remote sensing to collect high-resolution digital panchromatic and multispectral images for comprehensive evaluation of natural resources and environmental conditions. Most commercial high-resolution satellites such as SPOT-5, Ikonos-2, and QuickBird use similar sensors. Airborne sensors such as the ADS40 and STARIMAGER®also use the push-broom approach to collect multi-channel, seamless image strips for linear objects such as roads, railways, rivers, seashores, electric power lines, pipe lines, and high-rise building areas. Other commercial hyperspectral sensors also use the push-broom approach to collect digital images for remote sensing applications.High performance linear cameras require high resolution geometric, spectral, and radiometric calibration. This topic has not been covered in the scientific literature. Although the self-calibration is successful to compute the calibration parameters of frame camera, it is denied in our tests since the linear camera’s calibrated parameters are dependent on the accuracy of on-board GPS/IMU position and attitude data. In this paper, a rigorous calibration method is presented. This approach has been successfully used in our developed airborne three-line scanner (TLS) imaging system STARIMAGER®in the last five years. The method can accurately compute TLS’s focal length, principle point location, lens distortion, CCD pixel size, CCD curve deformation, and convergence angles between each CCD line sensor on the focal plane. Without any modification, it can be directly applied to single linear sensors and multi-linear sensors."
Robustness of Change Detection Algorithms in the Presence of Registration Errors,"Sundaresan, Ashok; Varshney, Pramod K.; Arora, Manoj K.",pp. 375-383(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000004/art00003;jsessionid=28nvpou5gnrp8.x-ic-live-03,"Accurate registration of multi-temporal remote sensing images is critical to any change detection study. The presence of registration errors in the images may affect the accuracy of change detection. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of two change detection algorithms in the presence of artificially introduced registration errors in the dataset. The algorithms considered are image differencing and an algorithm based on a Markov random field (MRF) model. Registration errors have been introduced in four different ways: only in x direction, only in y direction, in both x and y directions without any rotational misregistration, and finally in both x and y directions together with rotational misregistration. Three temporal datasets, a simulated dataset and two synthetic datasets created from remote sensing images acquired by the Landsat TM sensor, have been used in our study. The results indicate that the change detection algorithm based on the MRF model is more robust to the presence of registration errors than the image differencing method."
Improvement of Lidar Data Accuracy Using Lidar-Specific Ground Targets,"Csanyi, Nora; Toth, Charles K.",pp. 385-396(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000004/art00004;jsessionid=28nvpou5gnrp8.x-ic-live-03,"With recent advances of lidar technology, the accuracy potential of lidar data has significantly improved. State-ofthe-art lidar systems can achieve 2 to 3 cm ranging accuracy under ideal conditions, which is the accuracy level required by engineering scale mapping. However, this is also the accuracy range that cannot be realized by routine navigation-based direct sensor platform orientation. Furthermore, lidar systems are highly integrated multi-sensor systems, and the various components, as well as their spatial relationships, introduce different errors that can degrade the lidar data accuracy. Even after careful system calibration, including individual sensor calibration and sensors intra-calibration, certain errors in the collected data can still be present. These errors are usually dominated by navigation errors and cannot be totally eliminated without introducing absolute control information into the lidar data. Therefore, to support applications that require extremely high, engineering scale mapping accuracy, such as transportation corridor mapping, we propose the use of lidar-specific ground targets. Simulations were performed to determine the most advantageous lidar target design and targets were fabricated based upon the simulation results. To investigate the potential of using control targets for lidar data refinement, test flights were carried out with different flight parameters and target distributions. This paper provides a description of the optimal lidar target design, the target identification algorithm, and a detailed performance analysis, including the investigation of the achievable lidar data accuracy improvement using lidar-specific ground control targets in the case of various target distributions and flight parameters."
Estimating Nitrogen in Eucalypt Foliage by Automatically Extracting Tree Spectra from HyMap™ Data,"Huang, Zhi; Jia, Xiuping; Turner, Brian J.; Dury, Stephen J.; Wallis, Ian R.; Foley, William J.",pp. 397-401(5),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000004/art00005;jsessionid=28nvpou5gnrp8.x-ic-live-03,"Airborne HyMap™ data obtained from the crown reflectance of Eucalyptus melliodora were used to estimate nitrogen in the foliage. Estimating chemical concentrations in individual crowns by remote sensing is especially difficult for eucalypts because, first, there is marked variation between individual crowns and, secondly, separating leaf and background spectral information is difficult. We developed an automatic method to select relatively pure tree pixels for each tree. In this method, the background materials are modeled, and the pixels within a crown that do not resemble the background clusters are regarded as target pixels. A modified partial least squares gave an R2value for predicted versus determined nitrogen concentrations of 0.79, with an RMSE of 0.69 mg/g, less than half the standard deviation of the measured values. Automatically selecting tree pixels was more accurate than manual selection, while the study confirmed that using the maximum spectrum gives results that are as accurate as those from the mean spectrum."

The approach presented here synthesizes related work in photogrammetry and computer graphics/vision to automatically produce orthographic and perspective views based on fully 3D surface data (supplied by laser scanning). Surface occlusions in the direction of projection are detected to create the depth map of the new image. This information allows identifying, by visibility checking through back-projection of surface triangles, all source images which are entitled to contribute color to each pixel of the novel image. Weighted texture blending allows regulating the local radiometric contribution of each source image involved, while outlying color values are automatically discarded with a basic statistical test. Experimental results from a close-range project indicate that this fusion of laser scanning with multiview photogrammetry could indeed combine geometric accuracy with high visual quality and speed. A discussion of intended improvements of the algorithm is also included."

In the case of a “winnertakes-all” scenario, this does not allow us a measure of how much the prediction of each pixel’s land-cover can be trusted. We present a three-stage method where only winning candidates which are given a clear lead over the other land-cover types are accepted, with a neighborhood relationship and the application of mixed pixels being used to provide full classification. This method allows us to place more faith in the resulting map than simply taking the winner, and results in a higher accuracy of classification. The method is applied to Landsat imagery of an area of the Philippines where natural, urban, and cultivated land-cover types exist."

With its global coverage and all-weather imaging capability, INSAR is an important technique for measuring ground-surface deformation of volcanoes over cloud-prone and rainy regions such as the Aleutian Islands, where only less than 5 percent of optical imagery is usable due to inclement weather conditions. The spatial distribution of surface deformation data, derived from INSAR images, enables the construction of detailed mechanical models to enhance the study of magmatic processes. This paper reviews the basics of INSAR for volcanic deformation mapping and the INSAR studies of ten Aleutian volcanoes associated with both eruptive and noneruptive activity. These studies demonstrate that all-weather INSAR imaging can improve our understanding of how the Aleutian volcanoes work and enhance our capability to predict future eruptions and associated hazards."

Differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DINSAR) together with GPS and GIS have been studied as a complementary alternative by exploiting multi-source satellite SAR images over a mining site southwest of Sydney.Digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from ERS-1 and ERS-2 tandem images, photogrammetry, airborne laser scanning, and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission were assessed based on ground survey data using levelling as well as GPS-RTK. The identified high quality DEM was then used in the DINSAR analysis. Repeat-pass acquisitions by the ERS-1, ERS-2, JERS-1, RADARSAT-1 and ENVISAT satellites were used to monitor mine subsidence in the region with seven active mine collieries. Sub-centimeter accuracy has been demonstrated by comparing DINSAR results against ground survey profiles. The ERS tandem DINSAR results revealed mm-level resolution."
Study of Rain Events over the South China Sea by Synergistic Use of Multi-sensor Satellite and Ground-based Meteorological Data,"Alpers, Werner; Cheng, Cho Ming; Shao, Yun; Yang, Limin",pp. 267-278(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000003/art00003;jsessionid=13x9ruwz6yzla.x-ic-live-03,"Rain cells and rain bands over the South China Sea off the coast of Hong Kong are studied by using multi-sensor satellite and ground-based meteorological data. These include synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired by the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) onboard the European ENVISAT satellite, weather radar images from the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO), rain rate data acquired by the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) sensor onboard the F15 satellite of the American Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) and the rain sensors onboard the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) satellite, cloud image of GOES-9 satellite, sea surface wind maps acquired by the scatterometer onboard the QUIKSCAT satellite, and meteorological data from weather stations in Hong Kong. Three rain events, typical of Hong Kong, are studied. The first event consists of a cluster of rain cells associated with the summer monsoon, the second one of rain cells aligned in a rain band generated by an upper-air trough, and the third one consists of small rain cells embedded in a cold front. It is shown that ASAR images, which have a resolution of 30 m in the Image Mode (IM) and 150 m resolution in the Wide Swath Mode (WSM), yield much more detailed information on the spatial structure of rain events over the ocean than data obtained from SSSM/I and the rain sensors onboard the TRMM satellite. The precipitation radar (PR) onboard TRMM, which is the rain measuring instrument flown in space with the next best resolution, has a resolution of only 4 km. However, the disadvantage of SAR is that it is sometimes difficult to identify SAR signatures visible on SAR images of the sea surface unambiguously as caused by rain events. By comparing SAR images with simultaneously acquired weather radar images of the Hong Kong Observatory, a better knowledge of radar signatures on SAR images resulting from rain events over the ocean is obtained. This knowledge then helps greatly in detecting rain events on SAR images which are acquired over ocean areas, which are not in the reach of weather radar stations. SAR images containing radar signature of rain events allow a much more detailed study of fine-scale structures of rain events over the World’s ocean, in particular of clusters of rain cells, than any other sensor presently flown in space."
Quantitative Evaluation of Polarimetric Classification for Agricultural Crop Mapping,"Chen, Erxue; Li, Zengyuan; Pang, Yong; Tian, Xin",pp. 279-284(6),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000003/art00004;jsessionid=13x9ruwz6yzla.x-ic-live-03,"Agricultural crops classification capability of single band full polarization SAR data with different classification methods was evaluated using AIRSAR L-band polarimetric SAR data. It has been found that if only maximum likelihood (ML) classifiers, such as Wishart-maximum likelihood (WML) and normal distribution probability density functions (PDF)-based Maximum Likelihood (NML) classifier can be utilized, it is better to choose WML directly applied to complex coherency or covariance matrix. NML cannot achieve acceptable classification result if intensity and phase images derived from coherency matrix are directly used for training the classifier. But if these images were supplied to the spatial-spectral based classifier, Extraction and Classification of Homogenous Objects (ECHO), higher classification accuracy can be obtained. Very low crop types discrimination accuracy has been observed when only H-Alpha polarimetric decomposition resultant images, such as entropy, alpha and anisotropy, were supplied to NML or a spatial-spectral based classifier such as ECHO."
Efficient Water Area Classification Using Radarsat-1 SAR Imagery in a High Relief Mountainous Environment,"Song, Yeong-Sun; Sohn, Hong-Gyoo; Park, Choung-Hwan",pp. 285-296(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000003/art00005;jsessionid=13x9ruwz6yzla.x-ic-live-03,"It is important to determine quickly the extent of flooding during extreme cases. Even though SAR imagery with its own energy sources is highly applicable to flood monitoring owing to its sensitivity to the water area, topographic effects caused by local terrain relief must be carefully considered before the actual classification process. Since backscattering coefficients of the shadow area in high relief regions are very similar to those of the water area, it is essential to regard these areas before and after the classification procedure, although the process is a difficult and time-consuming task. In this study, efficient and economical methods for water area classification during floods in mountainous area are described. We tested five different cases using various synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image processing techniques, texture measures, and terrain shape information such as elevation and slope. The case whereby the SAR image was classified with the local slope information exhibited the best result for water area classification, even in small streams of different elevation categories. Consequently in mountainous areas, the combination of a SAR image and local slope information was the most appropriate method in estimating flooded areas."
Comparisons of Compositing Period Length for Vegetation Index Data from Polar-orbiting and Geostationary Satellites for the Cloud-prone Region of West Africa,"Fensholt, Rasmus; Anyamba, Assaf; Stisen, Simon; Sandholt, Inge; Pak, Ed; Small, Jennifer",pp. 297-309(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000003/art00006;jsessionid=13x9ruwz6yzla.x-ic-live-03,"Land surface data from MODIS and AVHRR have been extensively used for vegetation monitoring. In cloud-prone areas like West Africa the use of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data for vegetation monitoring is hampered by persistent cloud cover especially during the rainy season. The new geostationary satellite Meteosat Second Generation (SEVIRI MSG) is the first geostationary satellite suited for vegetation monitoring allowing NDVI to be derived with a 15-minute temporal resolution. For West Africa, MODIS (combined TERRA and AQUA) produce above 85 percent cloud-free pixels in the scene during the entire rainy season using 16-day composite periods. SEVIRI MSG data produces >98 percent cloud-free pixels during the entire season using a 3-day composite period. Therefore, there is a much higher probability for producing high quality cloud free data using SEVIRI MSG data for a short time composite period compared to Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite (POES) data, which is expected to substantially improve various applications of satellite based natural resource management, including vegetation monitoring, in West Africa."
Remote Sensing Change Detection Based on Canonical Correlation Analysis and Contextual Bayes Decision,"Zhang, Lu; Liao, Mingsheng; Yang, Limin; Lin, Hui",pp. 311-318(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000003/art00007;jsessionid=13x9ruwz6yzla.x-ic-live-03,"In this paper, we present a new approach combining canonical correlation analysis and contextual Bayes decision for change detection in bi-temporal multispectral remotely sensed images. Canonical correlation analysis in the form of Minimum Noise Fraction/Multivariate Alteration Detection transformation was first applied to two multispectral images to effectively yield a difference image, followed by a contextual Bayes decision procedure using automatic thresholding and Markov random field modeling techniques to identify areas where changes may have actually occurred from the difference image. An experiment of monitoring land reclamations in Hong Kong from Landsat TM/ETM+ images was conducted, and the results demonstrated effectiveness of our approach."
LUCC Impact on Sediment Loads in Subtropical Rainy Areas,"Chen, Xiaoling; Bao, Shuming; Li, Hui; Cai, Xiaobin; Guo, Peng; Wu, Zhongyi; Fu, Weijuan; Zhao, Hongmei",pp. 319-327(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000003/art00008;jsessionid=13x9ruwz6yzla.x-ic-live-03,"In this paper, we evaluate the impacts of land-use/cover changes (LUCC) on sediment loads at the outlets of five sub-watersheds of the Poyang Lake watershed by integrating remote sensing and GIS with statistical analysis. The intensively farmed watershed is characterized by a mountainous and hilly topography and a rainy climate. The primary goal of this paper is to help a better understanding of land-use/cover change and its driving forces. We discuss spatio-temporal variations in rainfall and sediment loads and identify factors contributing to those variations, analyze the comprehensive impacts of land-use/cover change on changing climate and human activities, and conclude that the changing rates of forest cover and climate regimes are primary factors for sediment discharges in the Poyang Lake watershed. Our results suggest that the eco-system still have large capacities to support human activities in the area."
Geometric Correction and Digital Elevation Extraction Using Multiple MTI Datasets,"Mercier, Jeffrey A.; Schowengerdt, Robert A.; Storey, James C.; Smith, Jody L.",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000002/art00001;jsessionid=1u2d6fs3tv3d4.x-ic-live-01,"Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are traditionally acquired from a stereo pair of aerial photographs sequentially captured by an airborne metric camera. Standard DEM extraction techniques can be naturally extended to satellite imagery, but the particular characteristics of satellite imaging can cause difficulties. The spacecraft ephemeris with respect to the ground site during image collects is the most important factor in the elevation extraction process. When the angle of separation between the stereo images is small, the extraction process typically produces measurements with low accuracy, while a large angle of separation can cause an excessive number of erroneous points in the DEM from occlusion of ground areas.The use of three or more images registered to the same ground area can potentially reduce these problems and improve the accuracy of the extracted DEM. The pointing capability of some sensors, such as the Multispectral Thermal Imager (MTI), allows for multiple collects of the same area from different perspectives. This functionality of MTI makes it a good candidate for the implementation of a DEM extraction algorithm using multiple images for improved accuracy. Evaluation of this capability and development of algorithms to geometrically model the MTI sensor and extract DEMs from multi-look MTI imagery are described in this paper. An RMS elevation error of 6.3-meters is achieved using 11 ground test points, while the MTI band has a 5-meter ground sample distance."
An Experiment Using a Circular Neighborhood to Calculate Slope Gradient from a DEM,"Shi, Xun; Zhu, A-Xing; Burt, James; Choi, Wes; Wang, Rongxun; Pei, Tao; Li, Baolin; Qin, Chengzhi",pp. 143-154(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000002/art00002;jsessionid=1u2d6fs3tv3d4.x-ic-live-01,"The traditional 3 X 3 cell neighborhood used in a focal operation on a raster layer has a square shape that results in a dimensional neighborhood of which the orientation is eventually arbitrary to the physical features represented. This paper presents an experiment using a circular neighborhood to calculate slope gradient. Comparisons of the results from a circular neighborhood with the results from some traditional methods show that (a) for a smooth surface, the result from a circular neighborhood is more accurate than that from a square neighborhood, (b) a circular neighborhood is generally more sensitive to noise in the input DEM than a square neighborhood, and (c) in a validation using field measurements, the circular neighborhood performs better than the square neighborhood when the ratio of user-specified neighborhood size to cell size is high."

The need for extensive data collection can be reduced through interpretation of several images simultaneously. This study focused evaluating the accuracy and functionality of stand volume models in overlapping multi-temporal images that could form large areas covering a mosaic of scenes. Various atmospheric correction methods were tested to generalize field information outside the coverage of single images. A dataset consisting of three overlapping Landsat ETM+ images taken on different dates was used to compare atmospheric correction methods with uncorrected raw data. The methods tested were 6S, SMAC, and DOS. Aerosol data from MODIS were used in retrieving parameters for the 6S algorithm. The coefficient of determination values for the regression models used in estimating the total volume of the standing crop varied from 0.46 to 0.62 and standard error from 57 to 77 m3/ha, depending on the image calibration method used. All the atmospheric correction methods improved the classification of the multitemporal images. In comparison to the uncorrected data, the relative RMSE values for the multitemporal images decreased by an average of 6 percent on with DOS, 14 percent with SMAC, and 15 percent with 6S."

Accuracy measures analogous to the familiar overall, user’s, and producer’s accuracies of a hard classification can be derived from a fuzzy error matrix. The formulas for estimating the fuzzy error matrix and accompanying accuracy measures depend on the sampling design used to collect the reference data. We derive these estimation formulas for stratified random sampling, a design commonly implemented in practice. A simulation study is conducted to confirm the validity of the stratified sampling estimators."
Filtering Airborne Laser Scanning Data with Morphological Methods,"Chen, Qi; Gong, Peng; Baldocchi, Dennis; Xie, Gengxin",pp. 175-185(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000002/art00005;jsessionid=1u2d6fs3tv3d4.x-ic-live-01,"Filtering methods based on morphological operations have been developed in some previous studies. The biggest challenge for these methods is how to keep the terrain features unchanged while using large window sizes for the morphological opening. Zhang et al. (2003) tried to achieve this goal, but their method required the assumption that the slope is constant. This paper presents a new method to achieve this goal without such restrictions, and methods for filling missing data and removing outliers are proposed. The experimental test results using the ISPRS Commission III/WG3 dataset show that this method performs well for most sites, except those with missing data due to the lack of overlap between swaths. This method also shows encouraging results for laser data with low pulse density."

The model is based on the classical collinearity equations, which are extended for the specific characteristics of the acquisition of CCD linear scanners. It includes the sensor position and attitude modeling with second-order piecewise polynomials depending on the acquisition time and a self-calibration for the correction of radial and decentering lens distortions, principal point(s) displacement, focal length(s) variation and CCD line(s) rotation in the focal plane. Using well-distributed GCPs and, additionally, Tie Points (TPs), the external orientation and self-calibration parameters, together with the TPs ground coordinates, are estimated in a least-square adjustment. In order to demonstrate the flexibility of the model, stereo images from pushbroom sensors with different characteristics have been oriented with sub-pixel accuracy in the checkpoints. The results are presented and discussed."
Combining Decision Trees with Hierarchical Object-oriented Image Analysis for Mapping Arid Rangelands,"Laliberte, Andrea S.; Fredrickson, Ed L.; Rango, Albert",pp. 197-207(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000002/art00007;jsessionid=1u2d6fs3tv3d4.x-ic-live-01,"Decision tree analysis is a statistical approach for developing a rule base used for image classification. We developed a unique approach using object-based rather than pixelbased image information as input for a classification tree for mapping arid land vegetation. A QuickBird satellite image was segmented at four different scales, resulting in a hierarchical network of image objects representing the image information in different spatial resolutions. This allowed for differentiation of individual shrubs at a fine scale and delineation of broader vegetation classes at coarser scales. Input variables included spectral, textural and contextual image information, and the variables chosen by the decision tree included many features not available or as easily determined with pixel based image analysis. Spectral information was selected near the top of the classification trees, while contextual and textural variables were more common closer to the terminal nodes of the classification tree. The combination of multi-resolution image segmentation and decision tree analysis facilitated the selection of input variables and helped in determining the appropriate image analysis scale."
New Methodologies for True Orthophoto Generation,"Habib, Ayman F.; Kim, Eui-Myoung; Kim, Chang-Jae",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000001/art00001;jsessionid=2u1vrl21j3wm.x-ic-live-01,"Orthophoto production aims at the elimination of sensor tilt and terrain relief effects from captured perspective imagery. Uniform scale and the absence of relief displacement in orthophotos make them an important component of GIS databases, where the user can directly determine geographic locations, measure distances, compute areas, and derive other useful information about the area in question. Differential rectification has been traditionally used for orthophoto generation. For large scale imagery over urban areas, differential rectification produces serious artifacts in the form of double mapped areas at object space locations with sudden relief variations, e.g., in the vicinity of buildings. Such artifacts are removed through true orthophoto generation methodologies which are based on the identification of occluded portions of the object space in the involved imagery. Existing methodologies suffer from several problems such as their sensitivity to the sampling interval of the digital surface model (DSM) as it relates to the ground sampling distance (GSD) of the imaging sensor. Moreover, current methodologies rely on the availability of a digital building model (DBM), which requires an additional and expensive pre-processing. This paper presents new methodologies for true orthophoto generation while circumventing the problems associated with existing techniques. The feasibility and performance of the suggested techniques are verified through experimental results with simulated and real data."

For our study area of St. Louis, Missouri, Landsat ETM+and Radarsat images are orthorectified and co-registered to each other. A maximum likelihood classifier is utilized to determine different land-cover categories. Ground reference data from sites throughout the study area are collected for training and validation. The variations in classification accuracy due to a number of radar imaging processing techniques are studied. The relationship between the processing window and the land classification is also investigated. In addition, the Landsat images are fused with several combinations of processed radar features. The classification accuracies from the Landsat and radar feature combinations are studied. Our research finds that fusion of multi-sensor data improves the classification accuracy over a single Landsat sensor, although different processing techniques on radar images are required to obtain the best results. In our study, fusion of Landsat images and Radarsat feature combinations from a 13×13 entropy window, 9×9 data range widow, and 19×19 mean filter window achieves the highest overall accuracy improvement (10 percent) over the Landsat images alone."

We tested a new portable hyperspectral imaging system, the SOC-700, manufactured by Surface Optics, which produces 12-bit reflectance images between 440 nm and 880 nm with a 4 nm spectral resolution. We quantified the reflectance properties and photochemical reflectance index (PRI) during light adaptation of genetically modifiedArabidopsis thaliana(L.) Heynh. plants lacking or over-expressing the PsbS protein, an essential component of the mechanism of non-photochemical dissipation. In a second experiment, PRI images of gradually water stressed leaves were compared to leaf-level measurements of reflectance using a second commercially available spectrometer, and chlorophyll fluorescence to detect dynamic, photosynthesis correlated changes in reflectance and PRI.In both experiments PRI measured with the SOC-700 changed, reflecting the biochemical adaptation of the photosynthetic apparatus to high light intensity (dynamic changes within minutes) and the gradual deactivation of photosynthesis during drying (changes within hours). The quantum efficiency of photosystem II(ΔF/Fm′)and non-photochemical energy dissipation (NPQ) measured from chlorophyll fluorescence, were strongly correlated with PRI. Leaf area PRI values estimated from individual pixel spectra of the SOC-700 quantified photosynthetic efficiency more thoroughly than PRI values calculated from point measurements using the hand-held GER-1500. The applications, limitations, and potential of the SOC-700 for plant eco-physiology and remote sensing are also discussed."

The C is a runoff index used as an input parameter in the most commonly used procedure: the rational method for storm-water runoff calculation in small urban watersheds for storm drainage design and analysis. The objective of this study was to evaluate 8-bit and 16-bit Quick-Bird (QB) NDVI satellite imagery using an unsupervised classification and the ISODATA algorithm to map impervious area and open space used for the determination of C in GIS spatial modeling. The research hypothesis was that mapping impervious area and open space using high spatial resolution NDVI satellite imagery, generated using the ISODATA algorithm, was an efficient and effective information extraction approach for accurately estimating spatial representative C values. The overall classification accuracies of the six QB NDVI thematic maps produced were similar, about 92 percent. In order to assess the utility of high spatial resolution satellite imagery and to validate the composite runoff index geographic model developed by Thanapura in 2005 and 2006, the C values were calculated in GIS spatial modeling and compared to the industry standard C. Finally, the hypothesis was accepted that the finer resolution image and mapping approach used in this study allowed for better discrimination of land-cover and thus a more accurate representative C estimation."

Thus, it is important to understand the nature of error and their sources, especially in the context of the intended use of a DEM. This paper investigates the effects that can be expected when common DEM errors propagate through a scaling analysis. The errors investigated include those associated with perturbation of camera exterior orientation parameters, focal length, and DEM image coordinates, which were simulated numerically. The role of detrending was also investigated. Scaling analysis, by way of the fractal dimension, using a new two-dimensional approach was carried out on a variety of surfaces before and after the introduction of error and the application of detrending. The results reveal some serious procedural implications on scaling analysis and cast doubt on the authenticity of some scaling analysis results in the absence of robust quality assessment and of independent supporting evidence."

The spatio-spectral template is employed which is then enhanced through use of a weighted Euclidean distance metric adapted from the Mahalanobis distance metric. The purpose is to assist the Canadian Coast Guard in gathering data on recreational boating for the modeling of search and rescue incidence risk.To test the detection accuracy of the enhanced spatio-spectral template, a dataset was created by gathering position and attribute data for 53 recreation vessel targets purposely moored for this research within Cadboro Bay, British Columbia, Canada. The Cadboro Bay study site containing the targets was imaged using Ikonos.The overall detection accuracy was 77 percent. The targets were broken down into two categories: Category A-less than 6 m in length, and Category B-greater than 6 m long. The detection rate for the Category B targets was 100 percent, while the detection rate for the Category A targets was 61 percent. It is important to note that some Category A targets were purposely selected for their small size to specifically test the detection limits of the enhanced spatio-spectral template. The smallest target detected was 2.2 meters long and 1.1 meters wide. The analysis also revealed that the ability to detect targets between 2.2 meters and 6 meters long was diminished if the target was a dark color."
Performance Analysis of Integrated Sensor Orientation,"Ip, Alain; El-Sheimy, Naser; Mostafa, Mohamed",pp. 89-97(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2007/00000073/00000001/art00007;jsessionid=2u1vrl21j3wm.x-ic-live-01,"Integrated multi-sensor systems, with their major progress in terms of sensor resolution, data rate and operational flexibility, have become a very attractive mapping tool over the last decade. In aerial mapping application, for example, Exterior Orientation (EO) parameters for the imaging sensors are required. Using the integrated Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) with Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), direct determination of the EO parameters can be obtained from the integrated system navigation solution. This process is referred to as Direct Georeferening (DG). DG provides substantial benefits over the indirect determination method of estimating the EO parameters from conventional Aerial Triangulation (AT) techniques using a block of images with a sufficient number of known control points. These benefits include the ability to map remote and inaccessible regions, and by replacing tie point measurements/matching and AT, significant cost-savings can be obtained for projects that do not require stereo models (such as projects with existing DEM or single image). The accuracy of DG, however, is limited by the accuracy attainable by the DGPS and any residual datum calibration errors. These can typically be as large as 10 cm RMSE, which is not sufficient for some large scale mapping applications. However, by combining the direct EO data a traditional block adjustment, AT techniques can be used to remove the residual errors in the solution. This technique is known as Integrated Sensor Orientation (ISO). It has several advantages over traditional AT, primarily because the stable geometry provided by direct EO can reduce the number of required GCP and tie-point to a minimum. At the same time, ISO provides an excellent tool for Quality Control/Quality Assurance (QC/QA) of the EO derived from a DG system. This paper examines the factors that determine the system performance for ISO. In addition, examples are given to illustrate the expected accuracy of an aerial mapping project using ISO under different qualities of DGPS/IMU data."
Change Detection Techniques for Canopy Height Growth Measurements Using Airborne Laser Scanner Data,"Yu, Xiaowei; Hyyppä, Juha; Kukko, Antero; Maltamo, Matti; Kaartinen, Harri",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000012/art00001;jsessionid=1kgt7kom2lrun.x-ic-live-01,"This paper analyzes the potential of airborne laser scanner data for measuring individual tree height growth in a boreal forest using 82 sample trees of Scots pine. Point clouds (10 points/m2, beam size 40 cm) illuminating 50 percent of the treetops were acquired in September 1998 and May 2003 with the Toposys 83 kHz lidar system. The reference height and height growth of pines were measured with a tacheometer in the field. Three different types of features were extracted from the point clouds representing each tree; they were the difference between the highest z values, the difference between the DSMs of the tree crown, and the differences between the 85th, 90thand 95thpercentiles of the canopy height histograms corresponding to the crown. The best correspondence with the field measurements was achieved with an R2value of 0.68 and a RMSE of 43 cm. The results indicate that it is possible to measure the growth of an individual tree with multi-temporal laser surveys. We also demonstrated a new algorithm for tree-to-tree matching. It is needed in operational growth estimation based on individual trees, especially in dense spruce forests. The method is based on minimizing the distances between treetops in the N-dimensional data space. The experiments showed that the use of the location (derived from laser data) and height of the trees were together adequate to provide reliable tree-to-tree matching. In the future, a fourth dimension (the crown area) should also be included in the matching."
Ground-based Laser Imaging for Assessing Three-dimensional Forest Canopy Structure,"Henning, Jason G.; Radtke, Philip J.",pp. 1349-1358(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000012/art00002;jsessionid=1kgt7kom2lrun.x-ic-live-01,"Improved understanding of the role of forests in carbon, nutrient, and water cycling can be facilitated with improved assessments of canopy structure, better linking leaf-level processes to canopy structure and forest growth. We examined the use of high-resolution, ground-based laser imaging for the spatially explicit assessment of forest canopies. Multiple range images were obtained and aligned during both leaf-off and leaf-on conditions on a 20 m × 40 m plot. The plot location was within a mixed species broadleaved deciduous forest in western North Carolina. Digital terrain and canopy height models were created for a 0.25 m square grid. Horizontal, vertical, and three-dimensional distributions of plant area index, created using gap-fraction based estimation, had 0.5 m resolution for a cubic lattice. Individual tree measurements, including tree positions and diameter at breast height, were made from the scanner data with positions, on average, within 0.43 m and diameters within 5 cm of independent measurements, respectively. Our methods and results confirm that applications of ground-based laser scanning provide high-resolution, spatially-explicit measures of plot-level forest canopy structure."
Examining the Influence of Changing Laser Pulse Repetition Frequencies on Conifer Forest Canopy Returns,"Chasmer, Laura; Hopkinson, Chris; Smith, Brent; Treitz, Paul",pp. 1359-1367(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000012/art00003;jsessionid=1kgt7kom2lrun.x-ic-live-01,"The distribution of laser pulses within conifer forest trees and canopies are examined by varying the rate of laser pulse emission and the inherent laser pulse properties (laser pulse energy, pulse width, pulse length, and roll-over or trigger time). In this study, an Optech, Inc. ALTM 3100 airborne lidar is used, emitting pulses at 50 kHz and 100 kHz, allowing for changes in laser pulse characteristics while also keeping all other survey parameters equal. We found that:1. Pulses and associated characteristics emitted at 50 kHz penetrated further into the canopy than 100 kHz for a significant number of individual trees.2. At tall tree plots with no understory, pulses emitted at 50 kHz penetrated further into the canopy than 100 kHz for a significant number of plots.3. For plots with significant understory and shorter trees, pulses emitted at 100 kHz penetrated further into the canopy than 50 kHz. We suspect that this may be due, in part, to canopy openness.Laser pulse energy and character differences associated with different laser pulse emission frequencies are likely a contributing factor in laser pulse penetration through the canopy to the ground surface. Efforts to understand laser pulse character influences on canopy returns are important as biomass and vegetation structure models derived from lidar are increasingly adopted."
Single Tree Segmentation Using Airborne Laser Scanner Data in a Structurally Heterogeneous Spruce Forest,"Solberg, Svein; Naesset, Erik; Bollandsas, Ole Martin",pp. 1369-1378(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000012/art00004;jsessionid=1kgt7kom2lrun.x-ic-live-01,"In this study, we present a new method for single tree segmentation and characterization from a canopy surface model (CSM), and its corresponding point cloud, based on airborne laser scanning. The method comprises new algorithms for controlling the shape of crown segments, and for residual adjustment of the canopy surface model (CSM). We present a new criterion that measures the success of locating trees, and demonstrate how this criterion can be used for optimizing the degree of CSM smoothing. From the adjusted CSM segments, we derived tree height and crown diameter, and based on all first laser pulse measurements within the segments we derived crown-base height. The method was applied and validated in a Norway spruce dominated forest reserve having a heterogeneous structure. The number of trees automatically detected varied with social status of the trees, from 93 percent of the dominant trees to 19 percent of the suppressed trees. The RMSE values for tree height, crown diameter, and crown-base height were around 1.2 m, 1.1 m, and 3.5 m, respectively. The method overestimated crown diameter (0.8 m) and crown base height (3.0 m)."

Using Tree Clusters to Derive Forest Properties from Small Footprint Lidar Data,"Bortolot, Zachary J.",pp. 1389-1397(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000012/art00006;jsessionid=1kgt7kom2lrun.x-ic-live-01,"This paper describes a new object-oriented small footprint lidar algorithm in which the objects of interest are tree clusters. The algorithm first thresholds the lidar canopy height model (CHM) at two levels to produce tree cluster grids. Next, two metrics are calculated based on these grids. The metric values are used in a multiple regression equation to predict the forest parameter of interest. To set the two thresholds, an optimization algorithm is used in conjunction with training data consisting of subsets of the CHM in which the forest parameters are known through ground measurements. A test of the algorithm was performed using ground and lidar data from a non-intensively managed loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantation in Virginia. The accuracies of the lidar-based predictions of density (0.01 ≤ R2≤ 0.80; 126 trees/ha ≤ RMSE ≤ 8,173 trees/ha) and biomass (0.04 ≤ R2≤ 0.62; 12.4 t/ha ≤ RMSE ≤ 316.5 t/ha) depended on the combination of metrics used, whether trees with a diameter at breast height < 10 cm were excluded from the analysis, and the number of plots used for training and testing. However, the fit between the ground measurements and tree cluster-based predictions generally exceeded the fit between ground measurements and the output from an individual tree-based algorithm tested using the same data (100 percent of comparable cases when density was predicted, 85 percent of comparable cases when biomass was predicted, based on the coefficient of determination and RMSE)."

Vegetation structure is a key characteristic of avian habitat, and can play a significant role in influencing habitat quality. Airborne lidar provides a means of measuring vegetation structure, supplying accurate data at high post-spacing and on a landscape-scale, which is impossible to achieve with field-based methods. We investigated how climate affected habitat quality using great tits (Parus major) breeding in woodland in eastern England. Mean chick body mass was used as a measure of habitat quality. Mean canopy height, calculated from a lidar digital canopy height model, was used as a measure of habitat structure. The influence of canopy height on body mass was examined for seven years during which weather conditions varied. The slopes and correlation coefficients of the mass/height relationships were related linearly to the warmth sum, an index of spring warmth, such that chick mass declined with canopy height in cold, late springs, but increased with height in warm, early springs. The parameters of the mass/height relationships, and the warmth sum, were also related linearly to the winter North Atlantic Oscillation index, but with a time lag of one year. Within the same wood, the structure conferring “best” habitat quality differed between years depending on weather conditions."

The EAARL sensor records the time history of the return waveform within a small footprint (20 cm diameter) for each laser pulse, enabling characterization of vegetation canopy structure and “bare earth” topography under a variety of vegetation types. A collection of individual waveforms combined within a synthesized large footprint was used to define three metrics: canopy height (CH), canopy reflection ratio (CRR), and height of median energy (HOME). Bare Earth Elevation (BEE) metric was derived using the individual small-footprint waveforms. All four metrics were tested for reproducibility, which resulted in an average of 95 percent correspondence within two standard deviations of the mean. CH and BEE values were also tested for accuracy using ground-truth data. The results presented in this paper show that combining several individual small-footprint laser pulses to define a composite “large-footprint” waveform is a possible method to depict the vertical structure of a vegetation canopy."
Using USDA Crop Progress Data for the Evaluation of Greenup Onset Date Calculated from MODIS 250-Meter Data,"Wardlow, Brian D.; Kastens, Jude H.; Egbert, Stephen L.",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000011/art00001;jsessionid=18ktrc9ag283c.x-ic-live-01,"Identification of the onset of vegetation greenup is a key-factor in characterizing and monitoring vegetation dynamics over large areas. However, the relationship between greenup onset dates estimated from satellite imagery and the actual growth stage of vegetation is often unclear. Herein, we present an approach for comparing pixel-level dnset dates to regional planting and emergence information for agricultural crops, with the goal of drawing reliable conclusions regarding the physical growth stage of the vegetation of interest at the time of greenup onset. To accomplish this, we calculated onset of greenup using modis 250 m, 16-day composite NDVl time series data for Kansas for 2001 and a recently proposed methodology for greenup detection. We then evaluated the estimated greenup dates using the locations of 1,417 large field sites that were planted to corn, soybeans, or sorghum in 2001, in conjunction with United States Department of Agriculture (usda) weekly crop progress reports containing crop planting and emergence percentage estimates.Average greenup onset dates calculated for the three summer crops showed that the dates were consistent with the relative planting order of corn, sorghum, and soybeans across the state. However, the influence of pre-crop vegetation (weeds and ""volunteer"" crops) introduced an early bias for the greenup onset dates calculated for many field sites. This pre-crop vegetation signal was most pronounced for the later planted summer crops (soybeans and sorghum) and in areas of Kansas that receive higher annual precipitation. The most reliable results were obtained for corn in semi-arid western Kansas, where pre-crop vegetation had considerably less influence on the greenup onset date calculations. The greenup onset date calculated for corn in western Kansas was found to occur 23 days after 50 percent of the crop had emerged. Corn’s greenup onset was detected, on average, at the agronomic stage where plants are 15 to 45 cm (6 to 18 inches) tall and the crop begins its rapid growth."
Evaluation of the Horizontal Resolution of SRTM Elevation Data,"Pierce, Leland; Kellndorf, Josef; Walker, Wayne; Barros, Oton",pp. 1235-1244(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000011/art00002;jsessionid=18ktrc9ag283c.x-ic-live-01,"The SRTM dataset is available at the USGS seamless website with one arc-second pixel spacing for the U.S. Recently, the value for horizontal resolution has been questioned. One paper (Smith and Sandwell, 2003) suggests that 60 meters may be more accurate, implying that the resolution is twice the provided spacing. For users of this data, the horizontal resolution is very important for their analyses. Hence, this paper addresses this important question by using two different approaches: coherence spectra and step-response. The coherence spectra approach uses statistical techniques to compare the SRTM dataset against a more accurate one, while the step response approach uses the observed step response in many areas of the dataset to estimate the width of the averaging function used to produce the SRTM data.Results from this study show that the resolution is between 1 and 1.6 pixels, depending on the local variability of the elevation data; with higher resolution near sharp edges and corners, and lower resolution in smoother areas."

They were used for locating the agricultural land that was abandoned during the war and is therefore considered as a mine contamination indicator. The mere location of the abandoned agricultural land is of limited use for supporting mine clearance. On the other hand, the integration of the location and spatial confidence level can help the mine experts in their decision making by evaluating both unlikelihood and likelihood of a plot of land to be abandoned."
Epipolar Resampling of Space-borne Linear Array Scanner Scenes Using Parallel Projection,"Morgan, Michel; Kim, Kyung-Ok; Jeong, Soo; Habib, Ayman",pp. 1255-1263(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000011/art00004;jsessionid=18ktrc9ag283c.x-ic-live-01,"Epipolar resampling aims at generating normalized images where conjugate points are located along the same row. Such a characteristic makes normalized imagery important for many applications such as automatic image matching, aerial triangulation, DEM and ortho-photo generation, and stereo-viewing. Traditionally, the input media for the normalization process are digital images captured by frame cameras. These images could be either derived by scanning analog photographs or directly captured by digital cameras. Current digital frame cameras provide smaller format imagery compared to those of analog cameras. In this regard, linear array scanners are emerging as a viable substitute to two-dimensional digital frame cameras. However, linear array scanners have more complex imaging geometry than that of frame cameras. In general, the imaging geometry of linear array scanners produces non-straight epipolar lines. Moreover, epipolar resampling of captured scenes according to the rigorous model, which faithfully describes the imaging process, requires the knowledge of the internal and external sensor characteristics as well as a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the object space. Recently, parallel projection has emerged as an alternative model approximating the imaging geometry of high altitude scanners with narrow angular field of view. In contrast to the rigorous model, the parallel projection model does not require the internal or the external characteristics of the imaging system and produces straight epipolar lines. In this paper, the parallel projection equations are modified for better modeling of linear array scanners. The modified parallel projection model is then used to resample linear array scanner scenes according to epipolar geometry. Experimental results using Ikonos and SPOT data demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed methodology."

Interpolation using Inverse Distance Weighting IDW resulted in lower mean error than other methods. Across the study area, overall signed error and RMSE were +0.02 m and 0.59 m, respectively. Signed errors indicated elevations were over-estimated in forest but under-estimated within meadow habitats. Increasing slope gradient increased vertical absolute errors and RMSE. In contrast, lidar sampling angle had little impact on measured error. These results have implications for the development and use of high-resolution DEM models derived from lidar data."
Urban Surface Biophysical Descriptors and Land Surface Temperature Variations,"Weng, Qihao; Lu, Dengsheng; Liang, Bingqing",pp. 1275-1286(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000011/art00006;jsessionid=18ktrc9ag283c.x-ic-live-01,"In remote sensing studies of land surface temperatures (LST), thematic land-use and land-cover (LULC) data are frequently-employed for simple correlation analyses between LULC types and their thermal signatures. Development of quantitative surface descriptors could improve our capabilities for modeling urban thermal landscapes and advance urban climate research. This study developed an analytical procedure based upon a spectral unmixing model for characterizing and quantifying the urban landscape in Indianapolis, Indiana. A Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus image of the study area, acquired on 22 June 2002, was spectrally unmixed into four fraction endmembers, namely, green vegetation, soil, high and low albedo. Impervious surface was then computed from the high and low albedo images. A hybrid classification procedure was developed to classify the fraction images into seven land-use and land-cover classes. Next, pixel-based LST measurements were related to urban surface biophysical descriptors derived from spectral mixture analysis (SMA). Correlation analyses were conducted to investigate land-cover based relationships between LST and impervious surface and green vegetation fractions for an analysis of the causes of LST variations. Results indicate that fraction images derived from SMA were effective for quantifying the urban morphology and for providing reliable measurements of biophysical variables such as vegetation abundance, soil, and impervious surface. An examination of LST variations within census block groups and their relationships with the compositions of LULC types, biophysical descriptors, and other relevant spatial data shows that LST possessed a weaker relation with the LULC compositions than with other variables (including urban biophysical descriptors, remote sensing biophysical variables, CIS-based impervious surface variables, and population density). Further research should be directed to refine spectral mixture modeling. The use of multi-temporal remote sensing data for urban time-space modeling and comparison of urban morphology in different geographical settings are also feasible."
The Individual Tree Crown Approach Applied to Ikonos Images of a Coniferous Plantation Area,"Gougeon, François A.; Leckie, Donald G.",pp. 1287-1297(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000011/art00007;jsessionid=18ktrc9ag283c.x-ic-live-01,"In forestry, the availability of high spatial resolution (<1 m/pixel) imagery from new earth observation satellites like Ikonos favours a shift in the image analysis paradigm from a pixel-based approach towards one dealing directly with the essential structuring element of such images: the individual tree crown (ITC). This paper gives an initial assessment of the effects of 1 m and 4 m/pixel spatial resolutions (panchromatic and multispectral bands, respectively) on the detection, delineation, and classification of the individual tree crowns seen in Ikonos images. Winter and summer Ikonos images of the Hudson plantation of the Petawawa Research Forest, Ontario, Canada were analyzed. The panchromatic images were resampled to 0.5 m/pixel and then smoothed using a 3 × 3 kernel mean filter. A valley-following algorithm and rule-based isolation module were applied to delineate the individual tree crowns. Local maxima within a moving 3 × 3 window (i.e., Tree Tops) were also extracted from the smoothed images for comparison. Crown delineation and detection results were summarised and compared with field tree counts. Overall, the ITC delineation and the local maxima approaches led to tree counts that were on average 15 percent off for both seasons. Visual inspection reveals delineation of clusters of two or three crowns as a common source of error. Crown-based species spectral signatures were generated for six classes representing conifer species, plus a hardwood class and a shrub class. After the ITC-based classification, classification accuracy was ascertained using separate test areas of known species. The overall accuracy was 59 percent. Important confusion exists between red and white spruces, and mature versus immature white pines, but post-classification regroupings into single spruce and white pine classes led to an overall accuracy of 67 percent."

In the acquisition plan, the gains were initially set to maximize the entropy in each scene. One unintended consequence of this strategy was that, at times, dense vegetation saturated band 4 and deserts saturated all bands. A revised strategy, based on a land-cover classification and sun angle thresholds, reduced saturation, but resulted in gain changes occurring within the same scene on multiple overpasses. As the gain changes cause some loss of data and difficulties for some ground processing systems, a procedure was devised to shift the gain changes to the nearest predicted cloudy scenes. The results are still not totally satisfactory as gain changes still impact some scenes and saturation still occurs, particularly in ephemerally snow-covered regions. A primary conclusion of our experience with variable gain on Landsat-7 is that such an approach should not be employed on future global monitoring missions."

By incorporating seasonality and cloud avoidance into the decision making used to schedule image acquisitions, the L7 data in the U.S. Landsat archive is more complete and of higher quality than has ever been previously achieved in the Landsat program.Development of the LTAP system evolved over more than a decade, starting in 1995. From 2002 to 2004 most attention has been given to validation of LTAP elements. We find that the original expectations and goals for the LTAP were surpassed for Landsat 7. When the L7 scan line corrector mirror failed, we adjusted the LTAP operations, effectively demonstrating the flexibility of the LTAP concept to address unanticipated needs. During validation, we also identified some seasonal and geographic acquisition shortcomings of the implementation: including how the spectral vegetation index measurements were used and regional/seasonal cloud climatology concerns. Some of these issues have already been at least partially addressed in the L7 LTAP, while others will wait further attention in the development of the LTAP for the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM). The lessons learned from a decade of work on the L7 LTAP provide a solid foundation upon which to build future mission LTAPs including the LDCM."

Visual assessment of clouds in three-band browse imagery were used for comparison to the five-band ACCA scores from a stratified sample of 212 ETM+2001 scenes. This comparison of independent cloud-cover estimators produced a 1:1 correlation with no offset. The largest commission errors were at high altitudes or at low solar illumination where snow was misclassified as clouds. The largest omission errors were associated with undetected optically thin cirrus clouds over water. There were no statistically significant systematic errors in ACCA scores analyzed by latitude, seasonality, or solar elevation angle. Enhancements for additional spectral bands, per-pixel masks, land/water boundaries, topography, shadows, multi-date and multi-sensor imagery were identified for possible use in future ACCA algorithms."

The camera is then calibrated for the lens setting employed. This requirement arises because calibration parameters vary significantly with zoom/focus setting. In this paper, a zoom-dependent calibration process is proposed whereby the image coordinate correction model for interior orientation and lens distortion is expressed as a function of the focal length written to the EXIF header of the image file. The proposed approach frees the practitioner from the requirement to utilize fixed zoom/focus settings for the images forming the photogrammetric network. Following a review of the behavior of camera calibration parameters with varying zoom settings, an account of the newly developed zoom-dependent calibration model is presented. Experimental results of its application to four digital cameras are analysed. These show that the proposed approach is suited to numerous applications of medium-accuracy, digital, close-range photogrammetry."
A 16-year Time Series of 1 km AVHRR Satellite Data of the Conterminous United States and Alaska,"Eidenshink, Jeff",pp. 1027-1035(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000009/art00002;jsessionid=1vatm8k3p886i.x-ic-live-01,"The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has developed a 16-year time series of vegetation condition information for the conterminous United States and Alaska using 1 km Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data. The AVHRR data have been processed using consistent methods that account for radiometric variability due to calibration uncertainty, the effects of the atmosphere on surface radiometric measurements obtained from wide field-of-view observations, and the geometric registration accuracy. The conterminous United States and Alaska data sets have an atmospheric correction for water vapor, ozone, and Rayleigh scattering and include a cloud mask derived using the Clouds from AVHRR (CLAVR) algorithm. In comparison with other AVHRR time series data sets, the conterminous United States and Alaska data are processed using similar techniques. The primary difference is that the conterminous United States and Alaska data are at 1 km resolution, while others are at 8 km resolution. The time series consists of weekly and biweekly maximum normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) composites."
Benthic Habitat Mapping in Tropical Marine Environments Using QuickBird Multispectral Data,"Mishra, Deepak; Narumalani, Sunil; Rundquist, Donald; Lawson, Merlin",pp. 1037-1048(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000009/art00003;jsessionid=1vatm8k3p886i.x-ic-live-01,"The objective of this research focused on the utility of QuickBird multispectral data for identifying and classifying tropical-marine benthic habitats after applying atmospheric and water-column corrections for an area around Roatan Island, Honduras. Atmospheric (Rayleigh and aerosol path radiance) and water column corrections (water depth and water column attenuation) were applied to the imagery, making it an effective method for mapping benthic habitats. Water depth for each pixel was calculated based on a linear model by regressing transformed radiance over known homogenous benthos against measured depths. Water column correction was achieved by deriving absorption and backscattering coefficients for each band of the image using a 50 × 50 window of clear water pixels. Corrections for water path radiance and water column attenuation of the bottom reflected radiance were made for the entire scene, allowing the bottom albedo to be determined for shallow coastal areas. An image of the bottom (i.e., an albedo image), minus the water column, was produced. Albedos were 8 percent for seagrass benthos, approximately 8 to 18 percent for coral areas, and 18 percent for sand dominated areas. An unsupervised classification algorithm was applied to the bottom albedo image, generating a classified map of benthic habitats. Accuracy assessment based on 383 reference points revealed an overall accuracy of 81 percent, with an overall Kappa value of 0.774."
Automatic Registration of Airborne Images with Complex Local Distortion,"Liu, Desheng; Gong, Peng; Kelly, Maggi; Guo, Qinghua",pp. 1049-1059(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000009/art00004;jsessionid=1vatm8k3p886i.x-ic-live-01,"Accurate registration of airborne images is challenging because complex local geometric distortions are often involved in image acquisition. In this paper, we propose a solution to this registration problem in two parts. First, we present an area-based method to extract sufficient numbers of well-located control points, and second, we use the extracted control points with local transformation models to register multi-temporal airborne images. The proposed image registration methods were applied to two airborne images with complex local distortion. Performance was evaluated and compared using different transformation models (global models and local models), different numbers of control points, and different similarity measures (correlation coefficient and mutual information). The results showed that local models outperformed global models, more control points could significantly improve local transformation models but not on the global transformation models, and two similarity measures performed similarly. These results revealed two important findings: first, the area-based methods generated larger amounts of evenly distributed control points; and second, local transformation models achieved better registration accuracy when larger amount of evenly distributed control points are used. We concluded that the combination of area-based control point extraction with local transformation models is effective for the registration of airborne images with complex local distortion."
Orientation of Ground-level Motion Imagery Using Building Facades,"Stefanidis, Anthony; Georgiadis, Charalampos; Agouris, Peggy",pp. 1061-1072(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000009/art00005;jsessionid=1vatm8k3p886i.x-ic-live-01,"In this paper, we address the orientation of ground-level motion imagery captured by sensors roaming in an urban area. We investigate the use of building façades (instead of traditional points), as matching features for ground-level motion imagery orientation. We assume a situation where few images in our sequence are already absolutely oriented, and present a novel approach to orient all remaining in-between image sequences relative to them. This innovative version of dependent orientation allows us to propagate orientation information within sequences of ground level imagery, establishing a novel orientation scheme. Experimental results show accuracies on the order of 0.18 to 0.29 degrees in rotation estimation, and 0.17 to 0.29 meters in camera position determination."

Quantifying DEM Uncertainty and its Effect on Topographic Parameters,"Wechsler, Suzanne P.; Kroll, Charles N.",pp. 1081-1090(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000009/art00007;jsessionid=1vatm8k3p886i.x-ic-live-01,"Digital elevation models (DEMs) are representations of topography with inherent errors that constitute uncertainty.DEM data are often used in analyses without quantifying the effects of these errors. This paper describes a Monte Carlo methodology for evaluation of the effects of uncertainty on elevation and derived topographic parameters. Four methods for representing DEM uncertainty that utilize meta-data and spatial characteristics of a DEM are presented. Seven statistics derived from simulation results were used to quantify the effect of DEM error. When uncertainty was quantified by the average relative absolute difference, elevation did not deviate. The range of deviation across the four methods for slope was 5 to 8 percent, 460 to 950 percent for derived catchment areas and 4 to 9 percent for the topographic index. This research demonstrates how application of this methodology can address DEM uncertainty, contributing to more responsible use of elevation and derived topographic parameters, and ultimately results obtained from their use."
Land-cover Mapping in the Brazilian Amazon Using SPOT-4 Vegetation Data and Machine Learning Classification Methods,"Carreiras, João M.B.; Pereira, José M.C.; Shimabukuro, Yosio E.",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000008/art00001;jsessionid=3jp6qd07602uj.x-ic-live-01,"The main objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of deriving a land-cover map of the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, for the year 2000, using data from the 1 km SPOT-4 VEGETATION (VGT) sensor. For this purpose we used a VGT temporal series of 12 monthly composite images, which were further transformed to physical-meaningful fraction images of vegetation, soil, and shade. Classification of fraction images was implemented using several recent machine learning developments, namely, filtering input training data and probability bagging in a classification tree approach.A 10-fold cross validation accuracy assessment indicates that filtering and probability bagging are effective at increasing overall and class-specific accuracy. Overall accuracy and mean probability of class membership were 0.88 and 0.80, respectively. The map of probability of class membership indicates that the larger errors are associated withcerradosavanna and semi-deciduous forest."

Association rule mining, a data mining technique, is used to explore nonlinear relationships among variables. Results indicate that higher vegetation intensity is associated with socioeconomic advantage in both sparsely populated, large lot suburban developments, as well as in older, urban neighborhoods. This pattern likely reflects residents’ ability to pay for the cost of maintaining high vegetation intensity, suburban lawn ecosystem vegetation in a semi-arid grassland environment. Additionally, residential choices may be limited by a home price structure that is closely related to the concentration of vegetation in the residential landscaping."
Isolating Individual Trees in a Savanna Woodland Using Small Footprint Lidar Data,"Chen, Qi; Baldocchi, Dennis; Gong, Peng; Kelly, Maggi",pp. 923-932(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000008/art00003;jsessionid=3jp6qd07602uj.x-ic-live-01,"This study presents a new method of detecting individual treetops from lidar data and applies marker-controlled watershed segmentation into isolating individual trees in savanna woodland. The treetops were detected by searching local maxima in a canopy maxima model (CMM) with variable window sizes. Different from previous methods, the variable windows sizes were determined by the lower-limit of the prediction intervals of the regression curve between crown size and tree height. The canopy maxima model was created to reduce the commission errors of treetop detection. Treetops were also detected based on the fact that they are typically located around the center of crowns. The tree delineation accuracy was evaluated by a five-fold, cross-validation method. Results showed that the absolute accuracy of tree isolation was 64.1 percent, which was much higher than the accuracy of the method, which only searched local maxima within window sizes determined by the regression curve (37.0 percent)."
Error Assessment in Two Lidar-derived TIN Datasets,"Peng, Miao-Hsiang; Shih, Tian-Yuan",pp. 933-947(15),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000008/art00004;jsessionid=3jp6qd07602uj.x-ic-live-01,"An accuracy assessment of two lidar-derived elevation datasets was conducted in areas of rugged terrain (average slope 26.6°). Data from 906 ground checkpoints in various land-cover types were collected in situ as reference points. Analysis of the accuracy of lidar-derived elevation as a function of several factors including terrain slope, terrain aspect, and land-cover types was conducted. This paper attempts to characterize vegetation information derived from lidar data based on variables such as canopy volume, local roughness of point clouds, point spacing of lidar ground returns, and vegetation angle. This information was used to evaluate the accuracy of elevation as a function of vegetation type. The experimental results revealed that the accuracy of elevation was considerably correlated with five factors: terrain slope, vegetation angle, canopy volume, local roughness of point clouds, and point spacing of lidar ground returns. The results show a linear relationship between the elevation accuracy and the combination of vegetation angle and the point spacing of ground returns (r2=0.9). The combination of vegetation angle and point spacing of ground returns explains a significant amount of the variability in elevation accuracy. Elevation accuracy varied with different vegetation types. The elevation accuracy was also linearly correlated with the product of the point spacing of ground returns and the tangent of the slope (r2=0.9). A greater product value implies a greater elevation error. In addition, with regard to terrain aspect, one dense dataset with extra cross-flight data revealed a lesser impact of aspect on elevation accuracy."

Training data were collected using region-growing initiated at random points within each image. The classified images were spatially post-processed using five different techniques. Image accuracy was assessed using the center land-use of all available FIA plots and subsets containing plots with 50, 75 and 100 percent homogeneity.Overall accuracy (81.9 to 95.4 percent) increased with homogeneity of validation plots and decreased with fragmentation (estimated by percent edge; r2= 0.932). Filtering effects were not consistently significant at the 95 percent level; however, the 3×3 majority filter significantly improved the accuracy of the most fragmented image. The now-automated IGSCR is a suitable candidate for operational forest area estimation, with strong potential for use in other application areas."
Accuracy Assessment of Lidar Saltmarsh Topographic Data Using RTK GPS,"Montané, Juana M.; Torres, Raymond",pp. 961-967(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000008/art00006;jsessionid=3jp6qd07602uj.x-ic-live-01,"An evaluation was completed to compare the accuracy of lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) against a statistically representative array of Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS data in a low gradient, vegetated Southeastern U.S. salt marsh. In order to discern potential bias, analyses were carried out separately on the platform-only data, the creek-only data and then the combined datasets. Lidar data were found to overestimate the RTK GPS topographic data by an overall average of only 7 cm. Additionally, these data showed little effect from the dominant macrophyte vegetation within the lidar footprint. From this evaluation, 7 cm appears to be an appropriate vertical adjustment factor for using lidar data in low gradient salt marshes. However, local ground control will continue to be crucial in studies of intertidal environments incorporating airborne laser data collection."

The cartometric DEMs were found to be more accurate than the photogrammetric DEMs for the small study site in this paper, with RMS errors in elevation of approximately 3.5 m and 4.5 m, respectively, and maximum absolute errors in elevation of approximately 12 m and 28 m, respectively. An important factor for environmental prediction studies is slope, and RMS errors in slope were approximately 6 percent and 20 percent for the cartometric and photogrammetric DEMs, respectively, with maximum absolute errors in slope of approximately 75 percent and 290 percent, respectively. However, use of suitable post-processing such as filtering may reduce the errors in photogrammetric DEMs to at least the same magnitude as car-tometric DEMs. The cartometric DEMs were found to satisfy the USGS specifications for Level 2 data."

Using a wall-to-wall land-cover map of the United States, we evaluated geographic scales of variance for nine landscape-level and eight forest pattern indices, and compared stratification by ecoregions, administrative units, and watersheds. Ecoregions accounted for 65 percent to 75 percent of the total variance of percent agriculture and percent forest because dominant land-cover is included in ecoregional definitions. In contrast, ecoregions explained only 13 percent to 34 percent of the variance of the other seven landscape-level pattern indices. After accounting for differences in amount of forest, ecoregions explained less than 5 percent of the variance of the eight forest pattern indices. None of the stratifications tested would be effective mapping units for land-cover pattern because within-unit variance of land-cover pattern is typically two to four times larger than between-unit variance."
Evaluation of Eelgrass Beds Mapping Using a High-Resolution Airborne Multispectral Scanner,"Su, Haiping; Karna, Duane; Fraim, Eric; Fitzgerald, Michael; Dominguez, Rose; Myers, Jeffrey S.; Coffland, Bruce; Handley, Lawrence R.; Mace, Thomas",pp. 789-797(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000007/art00003;jsessionid=66ppfi40uqasd.x-ic-live-01,"Eelgrass (Zostera marina) can provide vital ecological functions in stabilizing sediments, influencing current dynamics, and contributing significant amounts of biomass to numerous food webs in coastal ecosystems. Mapping eelgrass beds is important for coastal water and nearshore estuarine monitoring, management, and planning. This study demonstrated the possible use of high spatial (approximately 5 m) and temporal (maximum low tide) resolution airborne multispectral scanner on mapping eelgrass beds in Northern Puget Sound, Washington. A combination of supervised and unsupervised classification approaches were performed on the multispectral scanner imagery. A normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from the red and near-infrared bands and ancillary spatial information, were used to extract and mask eelgrass beds and other submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in the study area. We evaluated the resulting thematic map (geocoded, classified image) against a conventional aerial photograph interpretation using 260 point locations randomly stratified over five defined classes from the thematic map. We achieved an overall accuracy of 92 percent with 0.92 Kappa Coefficient in the study area. This study demonstrates that the airborne multispectral scanner can be useful for mapping eelgrass beds in a local or regional scale, especially in regions for which optical remote sensing from space is constrained by climatic and tidal conditions."
Object-based Detailed Vegetation Classification with Airborne High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery,"Yu, Qian; Gong, Peng; Clinton, Nick; Biging, Greg; Kelly, Maggi; Schirokauer, Dave",pp. 799-811(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000007/art00004;jsessionid=66ppfi40uqasd.x-ic-live-01,"In this paper, we evaluate the capability of the high spatial resolution airborne Digital Airborne Imaging System (DAIS) imagery for detailed vegetation classification at the alliance level with the aid of ancillary topographic data. Image objects as minimum classification units were generated through the Fractal Net Evolution Approach (FNEA) segmentation using eCognition software. For each object, 52 features were calculated including spectral features, textures, topographic features, and geometric features. After statistically ranking the importance of these features with the classification and regression tree algorithm (CART), the most effective features for classification were used to classify the vegetation. Due to the uneven sample size for each class, we chose a non-parametric (nearest neighbor) classifier. We built a hierarchical classification scheme and selected features for each of the broadest categories to carry out the detailed classification, which significantly improved the accuracy. Pixel-based maximum likelihood classification (MLC) with comparable features was used as a benchmark in evaluating our approach. The object-based classification approach overcame the problem of salt-and-pepper effects found in classification results from traditional pixel-based approaches. The method takes advantage of the rich amount of local spatial information present in the irregularly shaped objects in an image. This classification approach was successfully tested at Point Reyes National Seashore in Northern California to create a comprehensive vegetation inventory. Computer-assisted classification of high spatial resolution remotely sensed imagery has good potential to substitute or augment the present ground-based inventory of National Park lands."

Spectral classification was first carried out to separate the building class from non-building classes. Then, a building-presence binary image was generated so that building pixels were assigned a value of “1” and non-building pixels were assigned a value of “0.” Multiple texture bands were further generated employing a vari-ogram-based texture analysis and used for land-use classification. The generation of the building presence binary image allowed us not only to fully explore the capability of variogram-based analysis on spatial pattern detection, but also to prevent the variogram-based analysis from being disturbed by the natural fluctuation of spectral signals. The result from using a mosaic test image was considered satisfactory with a kappa coefficient of 0.72."

Assessment of the agreement of the data derived from various sources is an important issue in understanding the data continuity through the time-series. Some traditional measures, including correlation coefficient, coefficient of determination, mean absolute error, and root mean square error, are not always optimal for evaluating the data agreement. For this reason, we developed a new agreement coefficient for comparing two different images. The agreement coefficient has the following properties: non-dimensional, bounded, symmetric, and distinguishable between systematic and unsystematic differences. The paper provides examples of agreement analyses for hypothetical data and actual remotely sensed data. The results demonstrate that the agreement coefficient does include the above properties, and therefore is a useful tool for image comparison."

The advent of airborne stereo scanners of ultra high spatial resolution offers the possibility of a complete digital remote sensing processing system. Current sensors include the High-resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC), the ADS-40, and the Digital Mapping Camera (DMC). For automated analysis, however, the new sensors require also new processing techniques. This paper presents results of change monitoring analyses for areas along the shorelines of the Elbe and Weser rivers in North Germany using integrated HRSC and GIS datasets. An automated procedure for highly accurate mapping was developed which is based on a hierarchical stepwise approach integrating GIS methods and digital surface information in this process. This approach allows the production of GIS maps that are more detailed and accurate than those that were previously produced by conventional means. Within the GIS environment, the multitemporal analysis also allows the exact quantification and location of changes of the protected biotope types."
Canopy Reflectance Related to Marsh Dieback Onset and Progression in Coastal Louisiana,"Ramsey III, Elijah; Rangoonwala, Amina",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000006/art00001;jsessionid=17yfj9i3ig99t.x-ic-live-01,"In this study, we extended previous work linking leaf spectral changes, dieback onset, and progression ofSpartina alterni-floramarshes to changes in site-specific canopy reflectance spectra. First, we obtained canopy reflectance spectra (approximately 20 m ground resolution) from the marsh sites occupied during the leaf spectral analyses and from additional sites exhibiting visual signs of dieback. Subsequently, the canopy spectra were analyzed at two spectral scales: the first scale corresponded to whole-spectra sensors, such as the NASA Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) Hyperion, and the second scale corresponded to broadband spectral sensors, such as the EO-1 Advanced Land Imager and the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper. In the whole-spectra analysis, spectral indicators were generated from the whole canopy spectra (about 400 nm to 1,000 nm) by extracting typical dead and healthy marsh spectra, and subsequently using them to determine the percent composition of all canopy reflectance spectra. Percent compositions were then used to classify canopy spectra at each field site into groups exhibiting similar levels of dieback progression ranging from relatively healthy to completely dead. In the broadband reflectance analysis, blue, green, red, red-edge, and near infrared (NIR) spectral bands and NIR/green and NIR/red transforms were extracted from the canopy spectra. Spectral band and band transform indicators of marsh dieback and progression were generated by relating them to marsh status indicators derived from classifications of the 35 mm slides collected at the same time as the canopy reflectance recordings. The whole spectra and broadband spectral indicators were both able to distinguish (a) healthy marsh, (b) live marsh impacted by dieback, and (c) dead marsh, and they both provided some discrimination of dieback progression. Whole-spectra resolution sensors like the EO-1 Hyperion, however, offered an enhanced ability to categorize dieback progression."

A search for suitable satellite imagery revealed that the only way to identify the changes was to use data from three different sensors acquired over a 12-year time period: a 1987 Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) image, a 1999 Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image, and two SPOT 2 High Resolution Visible (HRV) images acquired in 1991 and 1997. Given that the Landsat and SPOT images have different spatial resolutions and that the spectral bands cover somewhat different spectral ranges, the challenge was how to combine the images in digital format to be able to detect subtle changes in the landscape. Measures of brightness, greenness, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were explored using standardized principal components analysis (PCA). Approximately 38 percent of the scene was occupied by water, so tests were performed with the water included and also with the water masked out to remove these low-variance pixels. Factor loadings and input-band contributions were used to interpret component images. Results show that PCA of the visible bands, representing brightness, is the superior approach for identifying new urban features in the landscape. For identification of changes to vegetation, the near-infrared (NIR) bands outperformed NDVI. Selected stan-dardized PCA images with visible and NIR bands are recommended for identifying general changes to an urban landscape using a time-series of imagery acquired by different satellite sensors. Benefits of using a mask are believed to be dependent upon study-site characteristics."

We examine the utility of multi-scale image segmentation/object-oriented image classification using the eCognition software to map seagrass across our 36,000 ha study area. The multi-scale image segmentation/ object oriented classification approach closely mirrored our conceptual model of the spatial structure of the seagrass habitats and successfully extracted the features of ecological interest. The agreement between the mapped results and the original field reference was 68 percent (Kappa = 56.5 percent) for the four category map and 83 percent (Kappa = 63.1 percent) for the presence/absence map; the agreement between the mapped results and the independent reference data was 71 percent (Kappa = 43.0 percent) for a simple presence/absence map. While the aerial digital camera imagery employed in this study had the advantage of flexible acquisition, suitable image scale, fast processing return time, and comparatively low cost, it had inconsistent radiometric response from image to image. This inconsistency made it difficult to develop a rule-based classification that was universally applicable across the 14 individual image mosaics. However, within the individual scene mosaics, using the eCognition software in a “manual classification” mode provided a flexible and time effective approach to mapping seagrass habitats."

Images have 1.1 km pixel resolution at nadir, <1 pixel systematic error (rotation, scale, distortion), but up to 9 pixels translation (offset) error. New fully-automated registration to a reference map corrects translation error to mean radial error<1 pixel suitable for full pixel resolution application in inshore waters and large estuaries. The approach converts AVHRR Channel 1 and 2 data to a land and water thematic image, finds the offset to maximize classification accuracy, and repositions the AVHRR and SST images. Registration was robust to cloud cover and missing data and was more reliable than manual registration for cloudy images. Developed for the southeast region of the U.S., the approach is transportable to other regions."
"High Spatial Resolution Satellite Imagery, DEM Derivatives, and Image Segmentation for the Detection of Mass Wasting Processes","Barlow, John; Franklin, Steven; Martin, Yvonne",pp. 687-692(6),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000006/art00005;jsessionid=17yfj9i3ig99t.x-ic-live-01,"An automated approach to identifying landslides using a combination of high-resolution satellite imagery and digital elevation derivatives is offered as an alternative to aerial photographic interpretation. Previous research has demonstrated that per pixel spectral response patterns are ineffective in discriminating mass movements. This technique utilizes image segmentation and digital elevation data in order to identify mass movements based not only on their reflectance but also on their shape properties and their geomorphic context. Dividing the classification by process into debris slides, debris flows, and rock slides makes the method far more useful than methods that group all mass movements together. A hierarchical classification scheme is utilized to eliminate areas that are not of interest and to identify areas where mass movements are probable. A supervised classification is then conducted using spectral, shape, and textural properties to identify failures that were greater than 1 ha in area. The resulting accuracy was 90 percent for debris slides, 60 percent for debris flows, and 80 percent for rock slides."
Fusing Landsat-5/TM Imagery and Shaded Relief Maps in Tectonic and Geomorphic Mapping,"Soulakellis, Nikolaos A.; Novak, Irwin D.; Zouros, Nikolaos; Lowman, Paul; Yates, Jacob",pp. 693-700(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000006/art00006;jsessionid=17yfj9i3ig99t.x-ic-live-01,"The significance of both solar elevation angle and azimuth are critical elements for examining Earth observation datasets. Illumination angle is a crucial parameter affecting the appearance of the topographically related and dependent features. Therefore, an improved methodology of data fusion for tectonic and geomorphic mapping is needed to augment the traditional false color composite analysis. A long-standing problem in such applications is the bias introduced by illumination geometry, specifically sun elevation and azimuth. A Landsat-5 image of Lesvos Island, Greece, was combined with digital elevation models to produce fused images with a wide range of illumination azimuths and elevation in a GIS environment. Sixteen combinations of sun elevation angle (using 15° and 30°) paired with azimuth (0° to 360° at 45° increments) were considered. This new technique compensates for local conditions such as generally cloudy winters which make it difficult to obtain images with low sun elevation or images of eroded landforms with subdued geomorphic expression. The resulting fused images combine the tonal information and high spatial resolution of Landsat with the strong topographic rendition of digital elevation models. Well-known faults, with more or less significant expression on the surface known from previous image interpretation and fieldwork, are more easily identifiable. Shaded relief maps produced by applying the lower illumination angle in combination with an azimuth perpendicular to the fault orientation produced the best results. Additionally, previously unknown linear and circular features, e.g., calderas, were represented in the low illumination angle image, independent of its azimuth. Fused images will be further combined with geologic and seismicity maps to study problems such as location of the Anatolian Plate’s boundaries and their nature (sharp or diffuse)."
Mapping Built-up Areas from Multitemporal Interferometric SAR Images - A Segment-based Approach,"Matikainen, Leena; Hyyppä, Juha; Engdahl, Marcus E.",pp. 701-714(14),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000006/art00007;jsessionid=17yfj9i3ig99t.x-ic-live-01,"Automatic mapping of built-up areas from a multitemporal interferometric ERS-1/2 Tandem dataset was studied. The image data were segmented into homogeneous regions, and the regions were classified as built-up areas, forests, and open areas using their mean intensity and coherence values and additional contextual information. Compared with a set of reference points, an overall classification accuracy of 97 percent was achieved. The classification process was highly automatic and resulted in homogeneous regions resembling a map drawn by a human interpreter. The feasibility of the imagery for dividing built-up areas further into subclasses was also investigated. The results suggest that low-rise areas, high-rise areas, and industrial areas are difficult to distinguish from each other. On the other hand, a correlation between the building density, the proportion of land covered with buildings, and intensity/coherence in the image data was found. The dataset thus appeared to be promising for classifying built-up areas into subclasses according to building density."

Semiautomatic Building Line Extraction from Ikonos Images Through Monoscopic Line Analysis,"Kim, Taejung; Lee, Tae-Yoon; Kim, Kyung-Ok",pp. 541-549(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000005/art00002;jsessionid=5pifh0cilgf2d.x-ic-live-01,"This paper proposes a new algorithm for extracting building lines from monoscopic high-resolution satellite images. We focus on extracting lines from rectangular-shaped building roofs with a relatively large size. We achieve this task by devising a unique approach using line voting and matching. Our algorithm works as follows. An input point on a building roof is given manually. A region of interest is defined centered on the input point and within the region lines extracted. Then, a line voting process is applied to estimate initial orientation and position of a building line. The orientation and position are refined by a least squares matching process. We assessed the performance of our algorithm against two Ikonos images. Our algorithm extracted building lines from over 83 percent of buildings tested with average angular accuracy of one or two degrees and average positional accuracy of approximately one pixel. This result supports the algorithm proposed in this paper. The major contribution of this paper is that we provided an alternative way to line grouping approaches when edge responses from buildings are not strong enough."

In most of the missions, stereo images can be acquired making 3D mapping from space very attractive, as high accuracy and level of detail become feasible from such data. In this paper, several case studies are presented, which have been applied to stereo pairs acquired by the SPOT sensors as well as the very high-resolution Ikonos sensor. As an extension to standard stereo mapping, a 3D mapping approach which makes use of multiple image coverage is presented. For this work, image triplets including multi-sensor data sets have been used to extract 3D topography information and to generate digital surface models. The benefit of this extended approach is comparatively assessed with respect to results achieved from standard stereo mapping."

The techniques used to merge high spatial resolution panchromatic images with high spectral resolution multispectral images are described. The most commonly used image fusion methods that work on the principle of component substitution (intensity-hue-saturation method (IHS), Brovey transform (BT), and multiplicative method (MULTI)) have been applied to Ikonos, QuickBird, Landsat, and aerial orthophoto images. Visual comparison, histogram analyses, correlation coefficients, and difference images were used in order to analyze the spectral and spatial qualities of the fused images. It was discovered that for preserving spectral characteristics, one needs a high level of similarity between the panchromatic image and the respective multispectral intensity. In order to achieve this, spectral sensitivity of multispectral and panchromatic data was performed, and digital values in individual bands have been modified before fusion. It has also been determined that spatial resolution is best preserved in the event of an unchanged input panchromatic image."

The model errors with respect to the length of the image strip are also demonstrated. Experimental results show that the RFM is well behaved, indicating that its positioning errors is similar to that of the RSM."
A Bottom-up Approach to Vegetation Mapping of the Lake Tahoe Basin Using Hyperspatial Image Analysis,"Greenberg, Jonathan A.; Dobrowski, Solomon Z.; Ramirez, Carlos M.; Tuil, Jahalel L.; Ustin, Susan L.",pp. 581-589(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000005/art00006;jsessionid=5pifh0cilgf2d.x-ic-live-01,"Increasing demands on the accuracy and thematic resolution of vegetation community maps from remote sensing imagery has created a need for novel image analysis techniques. We present a case study for vegetation mapping of the Lake Tahoe Basin which fulfills many of the requirements of the Federal Geographic Data Committee base-level mapping (FGDC, 1997) by using hyperspatial Ikonos imagery analyzed with a fusion of pixel-based species classification, automated image segmentation techniques to define vegetation patch boundaries, and vegetation community classification using querying of the species classification raster based on existing and novel rulesets. This technique led to accurate FGDC physiognomic classes. Floristic classes such as dominance type remain somewhat problematic due to inaccurate species classification results. Vegetation, tree and shrub cover estimates (FGDC required attributes) were determined accurately. We discuss strategies and challenges to vegetation community mapping in the context of standards currently being advanced for thematic attributes and accuracy requirements."
MTF-tailored Multiscale Fusion of High-resolution MS and Pan Imagery,"Aiazzi, B.; Alparone, L.; Baronti, S.; Garzelli, A.; Selva, M.",pp. 591-596(6),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000005/art00007;jsessionid=5pifh0cilgf2d.x-ic-live-01,"This work presents a multiresolution framework for merging a multispectral image having an arbitrary number of bands with a higher-resolution panchromatic observation. The fusion method relies on the generalized Laplacian pyramid (GLP), which is a multiscale, oversampled structure. The goal is to selectively perform injection of spatial frequencies from an image to another with the constraint of thoroughly retaining the spectral information of the coarser data. The novel idea is that a model of the modulation transfer functions (MTF) of the multispectral scanner is exploited to design the GLP reduction filter. Thus, the interband structure model (IBSM), which is calculated at the coarser scale, where both MS and PAN data are available, can be extended to the finer scale, without the drawback of the poor enhancement occurring when MTFs are assumed to be ideal filters. Experiments carried out on QuickBird data demonstrate that a superior spatial enhancement, besides the spectral quality typical of injection methods, is achieved by means of the MTF-adjusted fusion."
Comparison of 3D Physical and Empirical Models for Generating DSMs from Stereo HR Images,"Toutin, Thierry",pp. 597-604(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000005/art00008;jsessionid=5pifh0cilgf2d.x-ic-live-01,"This research study addressed and compared 3D physical and empirical models for stereo-processing and the generation of digital surface models (DSMs) from different stereo high-resolution (HR) sensors (Ikonos and QuickBird). The 3D physical model is Toutin’s Model (TM) developed at the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, and the empirical model is the rational function model (RFM). The study also evaluated the conditions of experimentation to appropriately use these 3D models. The first results on stereo-bundle adjustments demonstrated that TM and vendor-supplied RFMs gave similar results with Ikonos as soon as RFM was refined with a shift computed from one GCP. On the other hand, TM gave better results than vendor-supplied RFMs with QuickBird regardless of the polynomial order and the number of GCPs. Due to its relief dependency, QuickBird RFM needed to be refined at least with linear functions computed from at least 6 to 10 GCPs. Some large errors were, however, noted on forward image RFM in column. The DSMs were then generated using an intensity matching approach and compared to 0.2 m accurate lidar elevation data. Because DSMs included the height of land-cover (trees, houses), elevation linear errors with 90 percent confidence level (LE90) were computed and compared for the entire area and three land-cover classes (forests, urban/residential, bare surfaces). TM and vendor-supplied RFMs with Ikonos, regardless of the method and GCP number, achieved comparable results for all classes, while TM achieved overall better results than vendor-supplied RFMs with QuickBird. All results demonstrated the necessity of refining Ikonos RFM with a shift and one GCP only and QuickBird RFM with 1st-order linear functions and 6 to 10 GCPs due to its relief dependency."

This paper presents an approach to delineate single trees automatically in small footprint light detection and ranging (lidar) data in deciduous and mixed temperate forests. In rasterized laser data possible tree tops are detected with a local maximum filter. Afterwards the crowns are delineated with a combination of a pouring algorithm, knowledge-based assumptions on the shape of trees, and a final detection of the crown-edges by searching vectors starting from the trees’ tops. The segmentation results are assessed by comparison with terrestrial measured crown projections and with photogram-metrically delineated trees. The segmentation algorithm works well for coniferous stands. However, the implemented method tends to merge crowns in dense stands of deciduous trees."

Ordinary stereoscopic techniques require operators wearing glasses or using eyepieces for interpretation and measurement. However, the recent emerging autostereoscopic technology makes it possible to eliminate this requirement. This paper studies the principles and implementation of autostereoscopic photogrammetric measurement and evaluates its performance. We first describe the principles and properties of the parallax barrier-based autostereoscopic display used in this study. As an important metric property, we quantitatively present the autostereoscopic geometry, including viewing zones and the boundary of a viewer’s movement for autostereoscopic measurement. A toolkit AUTO3D is developed that has common photogrammetric functions. The implementation principles are described by addressing the differences compared to the ordinary stereoscopic technology. To evaluate the performance of the auto-stereoscopic measurement, images at a resolution of 25 m and 50 m are measured by a group of seven (7) operators, who are asked to digitize 18 well-defined roof points and 18 ground points. These results are evaluated by comparing the same measurements obtained from a popular stereoscopic photogrammetric workstation. It is shown that the precision of autostereoscopic measurement is about 16 percent to 25 percent lower than the conventional stereo workstation."

Our first method involves searching a pixel on each edge of a square whose digital numbers (DN) value has the largest deviation from the central pixel. Our second method uses a pixel on each edge of a square whose DN deviation from the central pixel is closest to the mean DN deviation from the central pixel to all pixels on the same edge. In our third method, eight pixels on the four edges of a square are used. Furthermore, common to the three proposed methods is the use of actual DN of the central pixel. The proposed computation methods have been tested using both simulated fractal surfaces and real images. Results show that the proposed methods appear to generally perform better than Clarke’s 1986 method for synthetic images with complex textures."

From these areas, a shape modeling algorithm has been used to precisely delineate their boundaries. The Dempster-Shafer data fusion technique is then applied to detect buildings from the combination of three data sources by a statistically-based classification. A number of test areas, which include buildings of different sizes, shape, and roof color have been investigated. The tests are encouraging and demonstrate that all processes in this system are important for effective building detection."

In this research, we detail the development of relationships between a range of individual crown health attributes representing symptoms ofSphaeropsis sapineainfection and high spatial and spectral resolution remotely sensed imagery characteristics. To do this, two methods were used; the first utilized vegetation spectral indices including simple and normalized difference ratios, and the second, linear spectral mixture analysis. Results indicate that spectral indices that utilize either chlorophyll absorption wavelengths at 680 nm with a non-chlorophyll region of the spectrum (such as 710 or 750 nm) or the slope of the upper red-edge between 710 and 740 nm were most significantly related to individual crown damage attributes. Linear unmixing analysis consistently extracted four fraction endmember images (sunlit canopy, soil, shadow, and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV)) from the 12 channel imagery. Multiple linear stepwise regression models developed using mixed fractional abundances provided similar results to those derived using spectral indices. The NPV and shadow endmembers, in order, were consistently identified as the most significant in these developed models."

While these two DEMs share several of their properties, they were processed independently. Here, we investigate what can be gained by merging the two DEMs into a single composite DEM for four different test areas. Based on an analysis of the relative differences and the deviations from an absolute reference in one test area, we propose an algorithm for combining the two DEMs optimally. We then compare the composite DEM with both individual DEMs and with a reference of a large number of precise GPS profiles in one test area in southern Germany. We find that in our test areas, the area of missing values is reduced significantly in the composite DEM. Even compared with the more complete C-band DEM, the number of void pixels can be reduced by 22 percent to 53 percent. Also, outlier values resulting from errors in the interferometric phase unwrapping can often be identified and removed in the merging. The deviations of both C- and X-band DEMs from the GPS reference are very similar and well within the accuracy specifications of the global data set. The standard deviation of the difference between the composite DEM and the reference is about 14 percent below that of the original values. Depending on the requirements for completeness and accuracy, merging the two SRTM elevation data sets may provide an important improvement above either of the original DEMs."

For basic parameters like average elevation or relief, the two data sets correlate very highly. For more derived measures, such as curvature and higher moments (skewness and kurtosis), the correlations are much lower, with some parameters essentially uncorrelated between the two DEMs. Correlations improve after restricting analysis to region with average slopes greater than 5 percent, and the SRTM data set compares more closely to simulated 2″NED than to 1″NED. SRTM has too much noise in flat areas, increasing average slope, while in high relief areas SRTM over smoothes topography and lowers average slopes.

Elevations generated by a medium-footprint (>10 m diameter) laser altimeter (lidar) system known asNASA’s Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) were used to assess the accuracy ofSRTMelevations at study sites of variable relief, and land-cover. Five study sites in Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Hampshire, and Costa Rica were chosen where coincidentLVISandSRTMdata occur. Both ground and canopy top lidar elevations were compared to theSRTMelevations. In “bare earth” regions, the mean vertical offset between theSRTMelevations andLVISground elevations varied with study site and was approximately 0.0 m, 0.5 m, 3.0 m, 4.0 m, and 4.5 m at the Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Costa Rica study sites, respectively. In vegetated regions, the mean vertical offset increased, implying the phase center fell above the ground, and the offset varied by region. TheSRTMelevations fell on average approximately 14 m below theLVIScanopy top elevations, except in Costa Rica where they were approximately 8 m below the canopy top. At all five study sites,SRTMelevations increased with increasing vertical extent (i.e., the difference between theLVIScanopy top and ground elevations and analogous to canopy height in vegetated regions). A linear relationship was found sufficient to describe the relationship between theSRTM-LVISelevation difference and canopy vertical extent."
SRTM C-Band and ICESat Laser Altimetry Elevation Comparisons as a Function of Tree Cover and Relief,"Carabajal, Claudia C.; Harding, David J.",pp. 287-298(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000003/art00006;jsessionid=1fgutv1gr10pk.x-ic-live-01,"The Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) instrument onboard the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) provides a globally distributed elevation data set that is well-suited to independently evaluate the accuracy of digital elevation models (DEMs), such as those produced by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). We document elevation differences between SRTM C-band 1 and 3 arcsecond resolution DEMs and ICESat 1064 nm altimeter channel elevation data acquired in an areas of variable topography and vegetation cover in the South American Amazon Basin, Asian Tibetan Plateau – Himalayan Mountains, East Africa, western Australia, and the western United States. GLAS received waveforms enable the estimation of SRTM radar phase center elevation biases and variability with respect to the highest (canopy top where vegetated), centroid (distance-weighted average), and lowest (ground) elevations detected within ICESat laser footprints. Distributions of ICESat minus SRTM elevation differences are quantified as a function of waveform extent (a measure of within-footprint relief), SRTM roughness (standard deviation of a 3 times; 3 array of elevation posts), and percent tree cover as reported in the Vegetation Continuous Field product derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data. SRTM roughness is linearly correlated with waveform extent for areas where percent tree cover is low. The SRTM phase center elevation is usually located between the ICESat highest and lowest elevations, and on average is closely correlated with the ICESat centroid. In areas of low relief and sparse tree cover, the mean of ICESat centroid minus SRTM phase center elevation differences for the five regions examined vary between –3.9 and 1.0 m, and the corresponding standard deviations are between 3.0 and 3.7 m. With increasing SRTM roughness and/or tree cover, the SRTM elevation remains essentially unbiased with respect to the ICESat centroid but the standard deviations of the differences increase to between 20 and 34 m, depending on the region. For the Australia, Amazon, Africa, United States, and Asia regions, including all tree cover and roughness conditions, 90 percent of the SRTM elevations are within 6.9, 11.5, 12.1, 16.8, and 37.1 m of the ICESat centroid, respectively. In vegetated areas, the SRTM elevation on average is located approximately 40 percent of the distance from the canopy top to the ground. The variability of this result increases significantly with increasing SRTM roughness. The results are generally consistent for the five regions examined, providing a method to estimate for any location the correspondence between SRTM elevations and highest, average, and lowest elevations using the globally-available MODIS-derived estimate of tree cover and the measure of SRTM roughness."
Mapping Height and Biomass of Mangrove Forests in Everglades National Park with SRTM Elevation Data,"Simard, Marc; Zhang, Keqi; Rivera-Monroy, Victor H.; Ross, Michael S.; Ruiz, Pablo L.; Castañeda-Moya, Edward; Twilley, Robert R.; Rodriguez, Ernesto",pp. 299-311(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000003/art00007;jsessionid=1fgutv1gr10pk.x-ic-live-01,"We produced a landscape scale map of mean tree height in mangrove forests in Everglades National Park (ENP) using the elevation data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The SRTM data was calibrated using airborne lidar data and a high resolution USGS digital elevation model (DEM). The resulting mangrove height map has a mean tree height error of 2.0 m (RMSE) over a pixel of 30 m. In addition, we used field data to derive a relationship between mean forest stand height and biomass in order to map the spatial distribution of standing biomass of mangroves for the entire National Park. The estimation showed that most of the mangrove standing biomass in the ENP resides in intermediate-height mangrove stands around 8 m. We estimated the total mangrove standing biomass in ENP to be 5.6 × 109kg."
Capability of SRTM C- and X-band DEM Data to Measure Water Elevations in Ohio and the Amazon,"Kiel, Brian; Alsdorf, Doug; LeFavour, Gina",pp. 313-320(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000003/art00008;jsessionid=1fgutv1gr10pk.x-ic-live-01,"We analyze Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) water surface elevation data to assess the capacity of interferometric radar for future surface water missions. Elevations from three Ohio reservoirs and several Amazon floodplain lakes have standard deviations, interpreted as errors, that are smaller in C-band compared to X-band and are smaller in Ohio than in the Amazon. These trends are also evident when comparing water surface elevations from the Muskingum River in Ohio with those of the Amazon River. Differences are attributed to increased averaging in C-band compared to X-band, greater sensitivity to surface water motion in X-band, and generally larger off-nadir look angles in X-band. Absolute water surface elevations are greater in the C-band DEM for much of the two study areas and yield expected slope values. Height and slope differences are attributed to differing usage of geoids and ellipsoids. These SRTM measurements suggest the great possibility for space-based, laterally-spatial (2D) measurements of water surface elevations."
Detection of Ancient Settlement Mounds,"Menze, B.H.; Ur, J.A.; Sherratt, A.G.",pp. 321-327(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000003/art00009;jsessionid=1fgutv1gr10pk.x-ic-live-01,"In the present study we demonstrate the value of the SRTM three arcsecond terrain model for a virtual survey of archaeological sites: the detection and mapping of ancient settlement mounds in the Near East. These so-called “tells” are the result of millennia of occupation within the period from 8000–1000 BC, and form visible landmarks of the world’s first farming and urban communities. The SRTM model provides for the first time an opportunity to scan areas not yet surveyed archaeologically on a supra-regional scale and to pinpoint probable tell sites. In order to map these historic monuments for the purpose of settlement-study and conservation, we develop a machine learning classifier which identifies probable tell sites from the terrain model. In a test, point-like elevations of a characteristic tell shape, standing out for more than 5 to 6 m in the DEM were successfully detected (85/133 tells). False positives (327/(600*1200) pixels) were primarily due to natural elevations, resembling tells in height and size."
Incorporating Remote Sensing Information in Modeling House Values,"Yu, Danlin; Wu, Changshan",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000002/art00001;jsessionid=bsbntvjphe7j.x-ic-live-02,"This paper explores the possibility of incorporating remote sensing information in modeling house values in the City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S.A. In particular, a Landsat ETM+ image was utilized to derive environmental characteristics, including the fractions of vegetation, impervious surface, and soil, with a linear spectral mixture analysis approach. These environmental characteristics, together with house structural attributes, were integrated to house value models. Two modeling techniques, a global OLSregression and a regression tree approach, were employed to build the relationship between house values and house structural and environmental characteristics. Analysis of results indicates that environmental characteristics generated from remote sensing technologies have strong influences on house values, and the addition of them improves house value modeling performance significantly. Moreover, the regression tree model proves as a better alternative to the OLS regression models in terms of predicting accuracy.In particular, based on the testing dataset, the mean average error (MAE) and relative error (RE) dropped from 0.202 and 0.434 for the OLS model to 0.134 and 0.280 for the regression tree model, while the correlation coefficient between the predicted and observed values increased from 0.903 to0.960. Further, as a nonparametric and local model, the regression tree method alleviates the problems with the OLS techniques and provides a means in delineating urban housing submarkets."
"An Integrated Approach to Wildland Fire Mapping of California, USA Using NOAA/AVHRR Data","Gong, Peng; Pu, Ruiliang; Li, Zhanqing; Scarborough, James; Clinton, Nicolas; Levien, Lisa M.",pp. 139-150(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000002/art00002;jsessionid=bsbntvjphe7j.x-ic-live-02,"To map wildland fires for emission estimation in California, this paper presents an integrated approach to wildfire mapping using daily data of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on board a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) satellite. The approach consists of two parts: active fire detection and burnt area mapping. In active fire detection, we combined the strengths of a fixed multi-channel threshold algorithm and an adaptive-threshold contextual algorithm and modified the fire detection algorithm developed by the Canada Center for Remote Sensing (CCRS) for fire detection in boreal forest ecosystems. We added a contextual test, which considers the radiometric difference between a fire pixel and its surrounding pixels, and a sun glint elimination test to the CCRS algorithm. This can effectively remove false alarms caused by highly reflective clouds and surfaces and by warm backgrounds. In burnt area mapping, we adopted and modified the Hotspot and NDVI Differencing Synergy (HANDS) algorithm, which combines the strengths of hotspot detection and multi-temporal NDVI differencing. We modified the HANDS procedure in three ways: normalizing post-fire NDVI to pre-fire NDVI by multiplying an NDVI ratio coefficient, calculating mean and standard deviation of NDVI decrease of land-cover types separately, and adding a new iteration procedure for confirming potential burnt pixels. When the integrated method was applied to the mapping of wildland fires in California during the 1999 fire season, it produced comparable results. Most of the wildfires mapped were found to be correct, especially for those in forested ecosystems. Validation was based both on limited ground truth from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and on interpreted burnt areas from Landsat 7 TM scenes."
Control Patches for Automatic Single Photo Orientation,"Jaw, Jen-Jer; Wu, Yi-Shen",pp. 151-157(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000002/art00003;jsessionid=bsbntvjphe7j.x-ic-live-02,"Traditional aerial triangulation has long relied on control points for orientating the photo models into a ground-based coordinate system, reducing the distortion effect when tying photos by imperfect photo measurements, and calibrating camera parameters. Field surveys to provide an adequate number of control points and manual measurements of the control points afterwards in the photos incur considerable cost both in labor and expense. The past decade has seen the development of digital photogrammetry as a result of integrating into the photogrammetric discipline both the advantages of image processing techniques and the rapid computational efficiency of the computer. Such a development has made possible database-supplied control entities, as well as the automation of matching control data between object space and image space. Inspired by this capability, we employ a control patches database where the control points are found on older imagery and matched in the new photo. The successful implementation of the proposal lies in an effective control patches database, robust matching methodology, and a reliable orientation approach. Single photo resection is applied whenever no less than three matched control patches are available. The experiments under this project suggest the potential efficiency of automatic control point measurements from the control patches database and a reliable photo orientation solution."
Comparison of Automated Watershed Delineations,"Baker, Matthew E.; Weller, Donald E.; Jordan, Thomas E.",pp. 159-168(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000002/art00004;jsessionid=bsbntvjphe7j.x-ic-live-02,"We compared manual delineations with those derived from ten automated delineations of 420 watersheds in four physiographic provinces of the Chesapeake Basin. Automated methods included commercial DEM-based routines and different parameterizations of four enhanced methods: stream burning, normalized excavation, surface reconditioning, and normalized reconditioning. Un-enhanced methods resulted in individual watershed boundaries with some gross discrepancies in watershed size relative to manual delineations (error rate of 0.22 > 25 percent difference compared to manual) and significantly different watershed size distributions (Mann-Whitney U p = 0.012). Integrating mapped streams through enhanced methods substantially improved correspondence with manual watersheds (error rates of only 0.08–0.02 > 25 percent difference). Analysis of cropland area among methods showed a significant difference between manual estimates and un-enhanced estimates (p = 0.049) that was corrected using enhanced algorithms. Subsequent analysis of percent cropland revealed that measurements of land cover proportions were not always affected by delineation errors. However, differences were large enough to influence regressions with stream nitrate-N at the 90 percent confidence level within one physiographic province. Enhanced delineations produced statistical relationships between percent cropland and nitrate-N concentrations consistent with manual delineations. The results provide support for enhanced automated watershed delineation within the Chesapeake Basin and suggest that nor-malized excavation can be an effective augmentation of existing stream burning and reconditioning procedures."

The analyses successfully distinguished broad cover types (potholes including emergent vegetation versus upland vegetation) at 92 percent overall accuracy. Overall accuracy dropped to 80 percent when upland vegetation was segregated into woody and grassy communities and to 71 percent when we attempted to classify at the species or near-species levels. The use of two image dates was of importance in the classifications; the failure to acquire early season imagery, therefore, might have impaired our results."
Assessing Accuracy of Net Change Derived from Land Cover Maps,"Stehman, Stephen V.; Wickham, James D.",pp. 175-185(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000002/art00006;jsessionid=bsbntvjphe7j.x-ic-live-02,"Net change derived from land-cover maps provides important information for environmental monitoring and modeling. To better target the objectives of net change accuracy, we require modifications of the sampling design and analysis protocols typically implemented for assessments focusing on single date or gross change maps. Mean absolute deviation estimated for user-defined reporting domains is suggested to characterize net change accuracy. Stratified sampling is often desirable to improve precision for high priority estimates (e.g., high net change domains), but decisions regarding the number and identity of strata must be made recognizing the precision trade-offs among the multiple estimates of interest in a net change assessment. The accuracy assessment strategy and a protocol for evaluating sampling design options are demonstrated using a population of map and reference net change derived from existing land-cover maps and representing change from 1990 to 2000."
Population Density and Image Texture,"Liu, XiaoHang; Clarke, Keith; Herold, Martin",pp. 187-196(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000002/art00007;jsessionid=bsbntvjphe7j.x-ic-live-02,"The correlation between census population density and Ikonos image texture was explored. The spatial unit for the analysis was census blocks with homogenous land-use. Ikonos image texture was described using three methods: the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), semi-variance, and spatial metrics. Linear regression was conducted to explore the correlation between image texture and population density. It was found that although correlation exists, its degree varies depending on the method used to describe image texture. The highest correlation is given by the spatial metrics method. This result suggests that the correlation between texture and population density is not strong enough to predict or forecast residential population. However, image texture does provide a base to refine census-reported population distribution using remote sensing. High-resolution satellite images therefore have the potential to support “smart interpolation” programs to estimate human population distribution in areas where detailed information is not available."
Effect of Alternative Splitting Rules on Image Processing Using Classification Tree Analysis,"Zambon, Michael; Lawrence, Rick; Bunn, Andrew; Powell, Scott",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000001/art00001;jsessionid=27b7nntlchbw9.x-ic-live-01,"Rule-based classification using classification tree analysis (CTA) is increasingly applied to remotely sensed data. CTA employs splitting rules to construct decision trees using training data as input. Results are then used for image classification. Software implementations of CTA offer different splitting rules and provide practitioners little guidance for their selection. We evaluated classification accuracy from four commonly used splitting rules and three types of imagery. Overall accuracies within data types varied less than 6 percent. Pairwise comparisons of kappa statistics indicated no significant differences (p-value > 0.05). Individual class accuracies, measured by user’s and producer’s accuracy, however, varied among methods. The entropy and twoing splitting rules most often accounted for the poorest performing classes. Based on analysis of the structure of the rules and the results from our three data sets, when the software provides the option, we recommend the gini and class probability rules for classification of remotely sensed data."

In this paper we present a technical approach that uses DOQs as the primary data source to map regional forest canopy cover. This approach, a form of advanced exploratory data analysis (AEDA), can separate areas of crown, shadow, and non-crown vegetation using a single value threshold and a “value range” threshold obtained by analyzing the statistical plots built on a multi-fractal model. By applying AEDA, we can distinguish the crown, crown boundary zone, shadow areas, and non-crown areas within a DOQ mosaic by their distinctive multifractal properties. Over a period of two years, we mapped canopy cover of 20,000 km2of ponderosa pine-dominated forest across northern Arizona using this technique. We used two hundred ground plot measurements from an independent source to assess the accuracy of the canopy cover map across an 8,000 km2region."

Large structure monitoring will often include the necessity of determining object deformations at a large number of points. Photogrammetric techniques offer a large potential for the solution of a wide range of measurement tasks in this field. A modular toolbox consisting of digital cameras, computer interfaces, illumination systems, calibration devices, combined with subpixel accuracy image measurement operators, multi-image matching techniques, and self-calibrating bundle adjustment in a suitable user interface, depicts a very powerful tool for tailoring custom-made solutions for material testing labs. Due to the wide range and the repetitive nature of measurements tasks in civil engineering, these applications could depict a significant future market for photogrammetry.This paper will briefly discuss the major hardware and software modules of a toolbox for civil engineering material testing and large structure monitoring. Based on several sample applications covering object dimensions from 10 cm to 500 meters, the potential of photogrammetric deformation measurement techniques will be shown. The major advantage of photogrammetric techniques can often be seen in the fact that they allow for highly automated measurements at a large number of points simultaneously. In many cases, object deformations can be determined at a precision in the order of 1:100,000 of the object dimension, based on off-the-shelf hardware components."

With the inclusion of co-registered lidar data, this accuracy increased to 89 percent. Furthermore, lidar data were utilized to generate stand specific descriptive information in areas of sagebrush presence and sagebrush absence. The methods and results of this study lay the framework for utilizing co-registered hyperspectral and lidar data to describe semi-arid shrubs in greater detail than would be feasible using either dataset independently or by most ground based surveys."
Estimation of Inter-annual Crop Area Variation by the Application of Spectral Angle Mapping to Low Resolution Multitemporal NDVI Images,"Rembold, Felix; Maselli, Fabio",pp. 55-62(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000001/art00005;jsessionid=27b7nntlchbw9.x-ic-live-01,"This current work is aimed at developing and testing a methodology which can be applied to low spatial resolution satellite data to assess inter-annual crop area variations on a regional scale. The methodology is based on the assumption that within mixed pixels, such variations are reflected by changes of the related multitemporal Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) profiles. This implies that low resolution NDVI images with high temporal frequency can be used to update land cover estimates derived from higher resolution cartography.Specifically, changes in shape of NDVI profiles are quantified by Spectral Angle Mapping (SAM), which has the advantage of being nearly insensitive to inter-year NDVI differences caused by meteorological variability. A calibration phase is then necessary to convert the information derived from SAM into relevant area variations which is carried out by a regression estimator calibrated to the data of a training year for which both low-resolution NDVI data and higher-resolution land-cover references are available. The methodology can also cope with inter-annual differences in the crop phenological cycles through temporal shifting of the reference NDVI profiles.The proposed methodology was applied in a study region in central Italy to estimate area changes of winter crops from low-resolution NDVI profiles. The accuracy of such estimates was assessed by comparison to official agricultural statistics. The method showed promise for estimating crop area variation on a regional scale with the accuracy of the final results dependent on the quality of the satellite data time series and of the reference high-resolution land-cover maps."

We exploit the better vertical and horizontal accuracy of the laser DSM, assumed to be available only for a small area, to ease the deformation of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (INSAR) DSM with built structures. To achieve this, we propose a method based on subsequent steps of geometrical correction, and mainly on a simple “stretching step” that uses laser data as a reference to adjust INSAR-derived building footprints. We show quantitative results obtained from two different urban areas, using different laser and radar data sets, to assess advantages and drawbacks of the proposed method."

The objective of this work was to evaluate Ikonos and Landsat-7 ETM+ imagery for mapping structural parameters and species composition of riparian vegetation in Australian tropical savannahs for a section of Keelbottom Creek, Queensland, Australia. Vegetation indices and image texture from Ikonos data were used for estimating leaf area index (R2= 0.13) and canopy percentage foliage cover (R2= 0.86). Pan-sharpened Ikonos data were used to map riparian species composition (overall accuracy = 55 percent) and riparian zone width (accuracy within ±3 m). Tree crowns could not be automatically delineated due to the lack of contrast between canopies and adjacent grass cover. The ETM+ imagery was suited for mapping the extent of riparian zones. Results presented demonstrate the capabilities of high and moderate spatial resolution imagery for mapping properties of riparian zones."

Our working hypothesis is that a large similitude would predict categories that will be more prone to confusion and hence image or map misclassification. We use two different existing data sets to demonstrate and evaluate the method, and the results support our original hypothesis. Consequently, we argue that classification schemes that are based on parameterized definitions could be assessed for problematic categories during their construction using our approach, and thus, enabling the identification of a thematic vagueness component to supplement the more traditional statistical measures derived from the error matrix."

In such a case, several uncertain parameters such as visibility, accessibility, and camera-object distance are introduced into the camera placement decision-making that make it a non-deterministic complicated process. Hence, the uncertain behavior of the vision constraints demands the use of the fuzzy logic inference approach for the camera placement network design. In this paper, a novel method based on fuzzy logic reasoning strategy is proposed for the accuracy enhancement of an existing photogrammetric network by automatically adding new exposures. The fuzzy system is designed to make use of human type reasoning strategy by incorporating appropriate rules. The results indicate the high potential of the proposed method for automatic sensor placement in vision metrology."
An Evaluation of Remote Sensing-derived Landscape Ecology Metrics for Reservoir Shoreline Environmental Monitoring,"Jackson, Mark W.; Jensen, John R.",pp. 1387-1397(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000012/art00003;jsessionid=44726sb09sj9r.x-ic-live-02,"The goal of this study was to determine the value of including landscape ecology patterns and structure metrics extracted from high-resolution, remotely-sensed imagery in the development of a Shoreline Environmental Impact Index (SEII). Methods of combining landscape ecology metrics to create a meaningful Shoreline Environmental Impact Index included multiple linear regression, multiple discriminant analysis, genetic neural networks, and feed-forward, back-propagation neural networks. The landscape ratings produced by the SEII’s generated using these methods were then compared to landscape ratings by experts. There was very little difference in the performance of several SEII’s generated despite differences in metrics and their weighting chosen by the different methods. The ratings from all methods showed their ability to reflect the expert ratings with moderate accuracy:≤84 percent agreement. Conclusions indicate that the contributions of landscape metrics to the ability of an SEII to discriminate between levels of shoreline degradation are variable, dependent upon the method of combination. Any of the current forms of the SEII is suitable for generating general indication of shoreline health."

Automatic segmentation of high-resolution satellite imagery is useful for obtaining more timely and accurate information. In this paper, we develop a method and algorithmic framework for automatically segmenting imagery into different regions corresponding to various features of texture, intensity, and color. The central rationale of the method is that information from the three feature channels are adaptively estimated and integrated into a split-merge plus pixel-wise refinement framework. In the procedure for split-merge and refinement, segmentation is realized by comparing similarities between different features of sub-regions. The similarity measure is based on feature distributions. Withouta prioriknowledge of image content, the image can be segmented into different regions that frequently correspond to different land-use or other objects. Experimental results indicate that the method performs much better in terms of correctness and adaptation than using single feature or multiple features, but with constant weight for each feature. The method can potentially be applied within a broad range of image segmentation contexts."
Acquisition of Through-water Aerial Survey Images,"Mount, Richard",pp. 1407-1415(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000012/art00005;jsessionid=44726sb09sj9r.x-ic-live-02,"The behavior of light at the air/water interface has substantial effects on the quality of vertical, or nadir-looking imagery used to interpret subsurface features for purposes such as marine habitat mapping. Reflection of the direct solar beam into the sensor by waves on the surface of the water creates bright glints, which obscure bottom features of interest. Sun angle, refraction, and reflection of the direct solar beam affect the amount of subsurface illumination and shadowing of bottom features. Simple interpretations of these sea surface effects are made with sufficient accuracy to improve planning for airborne, vertical image capture, particularly aerial photography or video imagery. The time available for image capture over shallow water is typically limited to a short period in the morning. The start time is controlled by subsurface illumination levels, which are determined by sun angle and locally variable factors, such as light attenuation by the water column, rather than surface reflection or subsurface shadowing. The end time is determined by sun glitter effects, which in this case study, are predictable from sun angle, camera field of view, and wind speed with an R2value of 0.9554."
Derivative Analysis of AVIRIS Data for Crop Stress Detection,"Estep, Lee; Carter, Gregory A.",pp. 1417-1421(5),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000012/art00006;jsessionid=44726sb09sj9r.x-ic-live-02,Low-altitude Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) hyperspectral imagery of a cornfield in Nebraska was used to determine whether derivative analysis methods provided enhanced plant stress detection compared with narrow-band ratios. The field was divided into 20 plots representing four replicates each of five nitrogen (N) fertilization treatments that ranged from 0 to 200 kg N/ha in 50 kg/ha increments. The imagery yielded a 3 m ground pixel size for 224 spectral bands. Derivative analysis provided no advantage in stress detection compared with the performance of narrow-band ratio indices derived from the literature. This result was attributed to a high leaf area index at the time of the overflight (LAI of approximately 5 to 6) and the high signal-to-noise character of the narrow AVIRIS bands.
A Methodology for Spatial Uncertainty Analysis Of Remote Sensing and GIS Products,"Wang, Guangxing; Gertner, George Z.; Fang, Shoufan; Anderson, Alan B.",pp. 1423-1432(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000012/art00007;jsessionid=44726sb09sj9r.x-ic-live-02,"When remote sensing and GIS products are generated, errors and uncertainties from collection, processing and analysis of image and ground data, and model development, accumulate and are propagated to the maps. The products thus possess many sources of uncertainties that vary spatially and temporally. Spatially identifying the sources of uncertainties, modeling their accumulation and propagation, and finally, quantifying them will be critical to control the quality of spatial data. This paper demonstrates a methodology and its applications for a case study in which uncertainty of predicted soil erosion is hierarchically partitioned into various primary components on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The methodology is based on a regionalized variable theory of variables. It integrates remote sensing aided co-simulation algorithms in geo-statistics, and uncertainty and error budget methods in uncertainty analysis. The simulation algorithms generate realizations that can be used to calculate local estimates, and the variances and co-variances between them. Uncertainty and error budget methods partition the uncertainty of output into various input components and quantify their relative uncertainty contributions. The results can thus suggest the main uncertainty sources and their variation spatially, and further provide a rationale to reduce errors in map generation and application."
Unsupervised Spectral Characterization of Shallow Lagoon Waters by the Use of Landsat TM and ETM+ Data,"Maselli, Fabio; Massi, Luca; Melillo, Chiara; Innamorati, Mario",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000011/art00001;jsessionid=1d2l2sbzxajrd.x-ic-live-02,"Assessing the conditions of coastal and shallow lagoon waters is a top priority among environmental monitoring activities, due the high ecological and economic importance of relevant resources. Satellite remote sensing offers great potential for this scope, although the interpretation of the spectral responses of shallow areas is complicated by the mixed signal coming from the water column and the bottom. This is particularly the case when using satellite data taken in few wide spectral channels, such as those of the Landsat TM and ETM= sensors, which were not specifically designed for marine applications. Relying on the hypothesis that these data are anyway informative on shallow water conditions, an unsupervised procedure was developed to separate the spectral contributions of seawater and bottom on the basis of simple approximations. The procedure is based on the simulation of different water/bottom multispectral configurations up to find out that which best fits the observed data. The validation of the procedure was carried out by its application first to synthetic images and next to two TM and one ETM= scenes taken over the Orbetello Lagoon in Central Italy. The outputs produced in the latter case were evaluated by comparison to existing ground references. In particular, correlation analyses were performed between the original and decomposed spectral signatures and the concentrations of optically active water constituents (pigments and yellow substance) measured “in situ” at dates close to those of the satellite data acquisitions. These analyses demonstrated the potential of the methodology, while also highlighting some limitations which could be overcome through the use of imagery taken by sensors with enhanced spectral and radiometric features."
"Urban Classification Using Full Spectral Information of Landsat ETM+ Imagery in Marion County, Indiana","Lu, Dengsheng; Weng, Qihao",pp. 1275-1284(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000011/art00002;jsessionid=1d2l2sbzxajrd.x-ic-live-02,"This paper compares different image processing routines to identify suitable remote sensing variables for urban classification in the Marion County, Indiana, USA, using a Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image. The ETM+ multispectral, panchromatic, and thermal images are used. Incorporation of spectral signature, texture, and surface temperature is examined, as well as data fusion techniques for combining a higher spatial resolution image with lower spatial resolution multispectral images. Results indicate that incorporation of texture from lower spatial resolution images or of a temperature image cannot improve classification accuracies. However, incorporation of textures derived from a higher spatial resolution panchromatic image improves the classification accuracy. In particular, use of data fusion result and texture image yields the best classification accuracy with an overall accuracy of 78 percent and a kappa index of 0.73 for eleven land use and land cover classes."
Assessment of Very High Spatial Resolution Satellite Image Segmentations,"Carleer, A.P.; Debeir, O.; Wolff, E.",pp. 1285-1294(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000011/art00003;jsessionid=1d2l2sbzxajrd.x-ic-live-02,"Since 1999, very high spatial resolution satellite data represent the surface of the Earth with more detail. However, information extraction by per pixel multispectral classification techniques proves to be very complex owing to the internal variability increase in land-cover units and to the weakness of spectral resolution. Image segmentation before classification was proposed as an alternative approach, but a large variety of segmentation algorithms were developed during the last 20 years, and a comparison of their implementation on very high spatial resolution images is necessary. In this study, four algorithms from the two main groups of segmentation algorithms (boundary-based and region-based) were evaluated and compared. In order to compare the algorithms, an evaluation of each algorithm was carried out with empirical discrepancy evaluation methods. This evaluation is carried out with a visual segmentation of Ikonos panchromatic images. The results show that the choice of parameters is very important and has a great influence on the segmentation results. The selected boundary-based algorithms are sensitive to the noise or texture. Better results are obtained with region-based algorithms, but a problem with the transition zones between the contrasted objects can be present."
Geometric Accuracy Evaluation of the DEM Generated by the Russian TK-350 Stereo Scenes Using the SRTM X- and C-band Interferometric DEMs,"Buyuksalih, Gurcan; Kocak, Guven; Oruc, Murat",pp. 1295-1301(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000011/art00004;jsessionid=1d2l2sbzxajrd.x-ic-live-02,"TK-350 stereo-scenes covering 200 km μ 300 km on the ground with a base-to-height-ratio of 0.52 have been analysed on Zonguldak testfield in the northwest of Turkey. The pixel size on the ground is 10 m. Control points digitised from 1:25 000 scale topographic maps have been used in the test. The sensor orientation was executed by the PCI Geomatica®V8.2 software package. TK-350 stereo-images can yield 3D geopositioning to an accuracy of about 10 m horizontally and 17 m vertically. Based on this orientation, DEM with 40 m cell size was generated by the related module of PCI system. For the validation of extracted DEM, matched data was checked against the interferometric DEMs from SRTM X- and C-band SAR data. Based on this comparison, the RMSE of Z values was found to be in the range of 25.6 to 36.9 m and 28.7 to 38.7 m outside and inside the forest area, respectively. However, accuracy results obtained against the SRTM C-band DEM are more representative than those of X-band since the coverage of C-band DEM on the interest area is larger than the X-band. There are some systematic shifts of the TK-350 DEM against the SRTM DEMs which lie between the 3.7 m to 6.2 m which is probably due to the different sensor orientation of TK-350 and SRTM datasets. Height discrepancies are also analysed as a function of terrain slope. It was found that slope depending components were always larger in the case of C-band DEM because of its larger cell spacing. In the forest areas, more dependency upon the slope was observed against the open areas."
Agreement Assessment of Spatially Explicit Regression-derived Forest Cover and Traditional Forest Industry Stand Type Maps,"Metzler, Jacob W.; Sader, Steven A.",pp. 1303-1309(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000011/art00005;jsessionid=1d2l2sbzxajrd.x-ic-live-02,"Forest regeneration assessment is an important forest management goal that requires accurate data about site-specific forest type and stand density. In this study, a methodology was developed to convert regression model output to maps of predicted softwood and hardwood percent cover at the scale of a Landsat ETM+ pixel. These maps provide forest type and percent cover at higher spatial scale (0.09 ha) than traditional GIS forest stand databases employ (e.g., 2 to 4 ha minimum mapping units). A modified accuracy assessment was performed between the Landsat regression derived maps and GIS type maps to evaluate their relative agreement. Two variations of the traditional error matrix were examined. The first was a “plus-one” matrix, where values next to the diagonal were included in the agreement calculations. The second variation, considered most appropriate for this study, included the use of “fuzzy logic” where the off-diagonal values were weighted for a better approximation of the GIS forest mapping criteria and forest type composition of the northern New England forest. The fuzzy logic error matrix indicated strong agreement between the regression derived and GIS forest type maps with an overall agreement ranging from 76 percent to 79 percent. Producer’s agreement from the fuzzy-logic error matrices ranged from 89 percent to 97 percent for softwood classes and 72 percent to 77 percent for hardwood. User’s agreement for softwood ranged from 71 percent to 82 percent and 80 percent to 87 percent for hardwood. These results suggest that the Landsat-derived maps can provide objective and reliable site-specific forest type and percent cover information that is not dependent on subjective photo interpretation methods. These maps will be evaluated in future studies to demonstrate practical forest regeneration management applications."

The six approaches tested include: two based on temporal image differencing and ratioing between pre-fire and post-fire images, two based on principal component analysis of pre- and post-fire imagery, and two based on artificial neural networks, one using just post-fire imagery and the other both pre- and post-fire imagery. Our results demonstrated the potential value for any of these methods to provide quantitative fire severity maps, but one of the image differencing methods (ND4/7) provided a flexible, robust, and analytically simple approach that could be applied anywhere in the Continental U.S.Based on the results of this test, the ND4/7 was implemented operationally to classify and map fire severity over 1.2 million hectares burned in the Northern Rocky Mountains and Northern Great Plains during the 2000 fire season, as well as the 2001 fire season (Gmelin and Brewer, 2002).

The proposed scheme is comprised of two major components: (a) orbit modeling, and (b) image orthorectification. In orbit modeling, we provide a collocation procedure to determine the precise orbits. In image orthorectification, the area of interest is sequentially subdivided into four quadrate tiles until a specified threshold for terrain variations is met. The threshold of maximum terrain variation in a tile will be optimized according to the computational efficiency and the accuracy requirements. Once the ground tiles are determined, we perform adaptive patch projection to the corresponding image pixels. Test images from SPOT5 Supermode and QuickBird satellites are included. The experimental results show that this algorithm can minimize the orthorectification computation time, while the modeling error is insignificant."

The Spirit rover has traversed a distance of 3.2 km (actual distance traveled instead of odometry) and Opportunity at 1.2 km. We localized the landers in the Gusev Crater and on the Meridiani Planum using two-way Doppler radio positioning technology and cartographic triangulations through landmarks visible in both orbital and ground images. Additional high-resolution orbital images were taken to verify the determined lander positions. Visual odometry and bundleadjustment technologies were applied to overcome wheel slippages, azimuthal angle drift and other navigation errors (as large as 21 percent). We generated timely topographic products including 68 orthophoto maps and 3D Digital Terrain Models, eight horizontal rover traverse maps, vertical traverse profiles up to Sol 214 for Spirit and Sol 62 for Opportunity, and five 3D crater models. A web-based landing-site Geographic Information System (GIS) has been set up at The Ohio State University to update and disseminate the daily localization and topographic information to support tactical and strategic operations of the mission. Also described in this paper are applications of the data for science operations planning, geological traverse survey, survey of windrelated features, and other science applications. The majority of the instruments onboard both rovers are healthy at this moment, and they will continue to explore the two landing sites on the Martian surface. We expect to report further localization and topographic mapping results to be achieved in the rest of the mission period and in post-mission data processing."

The shading map resembles an airbrush, shaded relief portrayal of the surface, and can be used as the input for quantitative reconstruction of topography by photoclinometry (shape-fromshading).

Recent studies have found that certain systematic misregistration exists among these two types of data due to a number of causes. In this research, a combined adjustment is proposed to correct such misregistration and accurately determine ground positions. Primary participants in this process are MOLA ranges and MOLA ground points, MOC image orientation data, and tie points collected from the MOC Narrow Angle (NA) stereo images. It is shown that the combined adjustment is very beneficial when the trajectory data has a large inconsistency. The outcome is the refined MOC image orientation and refined ground positions, which are validated by the improved MOC and MOLA registration as an independent evaluation. The theoretic study shows the ground position precision of the combined adjustment varies from 28 to 178 meters, depending on the quality of the trajectory data."

Light detection and ranging (lidar) and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (INSAR) DEMs of flat to mountainous landscapes were used to evaluate the occurrence of artifact depressions caused by the representation of surfaces using grids and random elevation error. The number of depressions in DEMs that result from grid representation was inversely related to grid spacing; however, normalizing for the number of grid cells in a DEM demonstrated that coarser grids were relatively more vulnerable to depressions. Flat landscapes containing extensive lakes experienced more depressions related to grid spacing and placement than high-relief areas. Stochastic modelling showed that error magnitude controlled the extent of vulnerability within a landscape to depressions caused by random error. Nevertheless, certain areas were likely to experience depressions regardless of the magnitude of random error, including flat areas, valley bottoms, and highly convergent topography."

For this reason, accuracy assessments of change measurements from feature-based approaches require careful evaluation of the impacts of positional errors across landscapes differing in spatial heterogeneity at different change detection resolutions. We quantified such impacts by computing the false changes produced by spatially shifting and comparing high-resolution ecological maps derived by feature interpretation and ground interpretation of 1 m resolution Ikonos imagery of rural China and 0.3 m resolution aerial photographs of suburban United States. Change detection error increased significantly as positional errors increased, as landscape heterogeneity increased, and as the change detection resolution became finer. Regression-derived relationships between change estimation error and positional error, change detection resolution, and landscape heterogeneity allow calculation of the minimum change detection window size at which it is possible to obtain change measurements of a specified accuracy given any set of feature-based ecological maps and their positional error. Prediction of this “optimal change detection resolution” is critical in producing reliable high-resolution change measurements from feature-based ecological maps."

MIVIS data were radiometrically corrected at the sensor altitude using the 6S radiative transfer code. The MERIS simulation process was verified using ETM+measurements acquired at the same time of the MIVIS flight and differences between simulated and actual radiance measurements in ETM+bands 1, 2, and 3 were about 10 percent.

MERIS radiances of both dates were used to describe the variation of chlorophyll-acontent in the lake that was estimated synchronously to remote observations using continuous track fluorometer data. In 2000, when the mean value of chlorophyll-awas about 6 mg/m3the best performing algorithm (RMSE=0.58 mg/m3) was a ratio of band differences using VIS and NIR wavelengths. In 2003, when the chlorophyll-aconcentration in the lake was very low (mean <1 mg/m3), a single channel centered at 490 nm was the best index in describing spatial variations of chlorophyll-a(RMSE=0.10 mg/m3). The results suggest that MERIS observations are providing useful information for assessing and monitoring chlorophyll-adistribution in lacustrine ecosystems."
Lag and Seasonality Considerations in Evaluating AVHRR NDVI Response to Precipitation,"Ji, Lei; Peters, Albert J.",pp. 1053-1061(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000009/art00004;jsessionid=3outagpao1gmg.x-ic-live-01,"Assessment of the relationship between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and precipitation is important in understanding vegetation and climate interaction at a large scale. NDVI response to precipitation, however, is difficult to quantify due to the lag and seasonality effects, which will vary due to vegetation cover type, soils and climate. A time series analysis was performed on biweekly NDVI and precipitation around weather stations in the northern and central U.S. Great Plains. Regression models that incorporate lag and seasonality effects were used to quantify the relationship between NDVI and lagged precipitation in grasslands and croplands. It was found that the time lag was shorter in the early growing season, but longer in the mid- to late-growing season for most locations. The regression models with seasonal adjustment indicate that the relationship between NDVI and precipitation over the entire growing season was strong, with R2values of 0.69 and 0.72 for grasslands and croplands, respectively. We conclude that vegetation greenness can be predicted using current and antecedent precipitation, if seasonal effects are taken into account."
Triangulation of Well-Defined Points as a Constraint for Reliable Image Matching,"Zhu, Qing; Zhao, Jie; Lin, Hui; Gong, Jianya",pp. 1063-1069(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000009/art00005;jsessionid=3outagpao1gmg.x-ic-live-01,"This study demonstrates the utilization of the well-defined points to improve the reliability and accuracy of image matching. The basic principle is: (a) to triangulate a few well-defined points within the stereo model area to form a coarse triangulation; (b) to detect certain amount of corners within each triangle for further matching; (c) to propagate the matching of corner points from the reference points (i.e., the three triangle vertices) to obtain the best matching for each of these corners; (d) to dynamically update the triangulation by inserting the newly matched corner; and (e) to further detect corners and perform matching for them until a pre-defined criteria (the minimum size of triangle or the largest number of points matched) is reached. Experimental results reveal: (a) the false matching caused by the occlusion and repetitive texture is diminished; (b) the accuracy is improved, i.e., with a reduction of RMSE of check points (located in different types of terrain areas) by 12 percent to 62 percent, and a reduction of the largest error by up to two times; and (c) most building corners and boundary points of main objects could be matched directly and accurately."
Effects of Forest Environment and Survey Protocol on GPS Accuracy,"Piedallu, Christian; Gégout, Jean-Claude",pp. 1071-1078(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000009/art00006;jsessionid=3outagpao1gmg.x-ic-live-01,"The aim of the study is to test GPS equipment receivers commonly used for natural resource management, and to quantify recording rate and positioning quality under different conditions, the objective being to assist GPS users in their choices.Four factors were evaluated: (a) the type of receiver: three ranges of GPS equipment were compared; (b) forest cover effects (three covers were tested: open cover, coppice and deciduous high forest); (c) the effects of GPS survey components: the number of recordings (between 1 and 300), the Position Dilution of Precision (PDOP) thresholding (between 4 and 50), the time interval between recordings (between 1 and 15 seconds), and the differential correction effect; and (d) the season (winter and summer).A GPS survey was carried out and a database of 140,000 readings was established, from which a large number of random rover files were extracted for each combination of factors.It appears the only factor not to be significant is the seasonal effect. The type of equipment used and the forest cover effect both modify positioning accuracy by a factor of 2 or 3, as does the use of differential correction for Trimble receivers in open cover. Increasing the number of recordings and the time interval between recordings, and decreasing the PDOP threshold, improve precision, with a different effect according to the GPS receiver and the forest cover. The effect is generally more pronounced under high forest cover. The combined effects of GPS survey components produce significant changes in accuracy at the expense of the time spent in acquiring data."
Cloud-Free Satellite Image Mosaics with Regression Trees and Histogram Matching,"Helmer, E.H.; Ruefenacht, B.",pp. 1079-1089(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000009/art00007;jsessionid=3outagpao1gmg.x-ic-live-01,"Cloud-free optical satellite imagery simplifies remote sensing, but land-cover phenology limits existing solutions to persistent cloudiness to compositing temporally resolute, spatially coarser imagery. Here, a new strategy for developing cloud-free imagery at finer resolution permits simple automatic change detection. The strategy uses regression trees to predict pixel values underneath clouds and cloud shadows in reference scenes from other scene dates. It then applies improved histogram matching to adjacent scenes. In the study area, the islands of Puerto Rico, Vieques, and Culebra, Landsat image mosaics resulting from this strategy permit accurate detection of land development with only spectral data and maximum likelihood classification. Between about 1991 and 2000, urban/built-up lands increased by 7.2 percent in Puerto Rico and 49 percent in Vieques and Culebra. The regression tree modeling and histogram matching require no manual interpretation. Consequently, they can support large volume processing to distribute cloud-free imagery for simple change detections with common classifiers."
Bias-compensated RPCs for Sensor Orientation of High-resolution Satellite Imagery,"Fraser, Clive S.; Hanley, Harry B.",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000008/art00001;jsessionid=fifm0p14mg5s6.x-ic-live-02,"The demand for higher quality metric products from highresolution satellite imagery (HRSI) is growing, and the number of HRSI sensors and product options is increasing. There is a greater need to fully understand the potential and indeed shortcomings of alternative photogrammetric sensor orientation models for HRSI. To date, rational functions have proven to be a viable alternative model for geo-positioning, and with the recent innovation of bias-compensated RPC bundle adjustment, it has been demonstrated that sensor orientation to sub-pixel level can be achieved with minimal ground control. Questions have lingered, however, as to the general suitability of bias-compensated rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs), and indeed rational functions in general. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the wide applicability of bias-compensated RPCs for high-accuracy geopositioning from stereo HRSI. The case of stereo imagery over mountainous terrain will be specifically addressed, and results of experimental testing of both Ikonos and QuickBird imagery will be presented."
A Dynamic Method for Generating Multi-Resolution TIN Models,"Yang, Bisheng; Shi, Wenzhong; Li, Qingquan",pp. 917-926(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000008/art00002;jsessionid=fifm0p14mg5s6.x-ic-live-02,"It is essential to generate multi-resolution Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) models dynamically and efficiently in three-dimensional (3D) visualization, virtual reality, and geographic information systems (GIS), because the data that needs to be processed is multiple in scale and large in volume. This paper proposes a new method, which extends the edge collapse and vertex split algorithms, to dynamically generate a multi-resolution TIN models. In contrast to previous approaches, a new method is proposed to encode and store vertex dependency relationships in the multi-resolution model. As a result, the validity of vertex splits and edge collapses is improved; the efficiency of storing data is also enhanced by the proposed method. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we further extend the assessment to (a) time cost; (b) the quality of the multi-resolution TIN model; and (c) the view-dependent multi-resolution model. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the elevation of the vertex and the quality of the shape of the triangle are adopted to evaluate the quality of a generated multiresolution TIN model. The results of the experiment demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than previous methods in terms of time cost, and can achieve multiresolution TIN models with a higher accuracy."

This study evaluates and compares two lacunarity methods, fractal triangular prism, spatial autocorrelation, and original spectral band approaches in classifying urban images. Results from this study show that the traditional spectral-based classification approach is inappropriate in classifying urban categories from highresolution data. The fractal triangular prism approach was also found to be ineffective in classifying urban features. Spatial autocorrelation was more accurate than the fractal approach. The overall accuracies in this study for the fractal, conventional spectral, spatial autocorrelation, lacunarity binary, and lacunarity gray-scale approaches were 52 percent, 55 percent, 78 percent, 81 percent, and 92 percent, respectively. These findings suggest that the lacunarity approaches are far more effective than the other approaches tested and can be used to drastically improve urban classification accuracy."
Fuzzy Reliability Assessment of Multi-Period Land-cover Change Maps,"Lowell, Kim; Richards, Gary; Woodgate, Peter; Jones, Simon; Buxton, Laurie",pp. 939-945(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000008/art00004;jsessionid=fifm0p14mg5s6.x-ic-live-02,"A fuzzy methodology is presented for evaluating the reliability of satellite imagery-derived, continent-wide (Australia) land-cover deforestation/regrowth maps covering the period of 1972 to 2000 in ten discrete time periods. The methodology uses aerial photographs as its reference data and accommodates the difficulty inherent in determining definitively from an aerial photograph, whether a sample point is Forest or Non-forest by permitting interpreters to identify their level of certainty, i.e., Definitely Forest, Probably Forest, Uncertain, Probably Non-forest, or Definitely Nonforest. This information is then cross-tabulated against the Forest/Non-forest classification for the classified image closest in date to the photo date. Information from several photographs is summarized over a larger geographic area and over all time periods. Subsequently, temporal lineage information for each sample pixel is extracted from the 1972 to 2000 series of classified images to determine if a pixel’s lineage is Forest Throughout, Non-forest Throughout, Deforestation, Regrowth, or Cyclic. The fuzzy evaluation for individual pixels is then tabulated against this lineage information to identify if pixels of any particular lineage have an elevated tendency to be misclassified. The methodology provides a means by which problems in the map production methodology can be improved as future time slices are added."
"Using Landsat ETM + Imagery to Measure Population Density in Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","Li, Guiying; Weng, Qihao",pp. 947-958(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000008/art00005;jsessionid=fifm0p14mg5s6.x-ic-live-02,"Remote sensing techniques have been previously used in urban analysis, settlement detection, and population estimation. This research explores the potentials of integration of Landsat ETM + data with census data for estimation of population density in City of Indianapolis, Indiana. Spectral signatures, principal components, vegetation indices, fraction images, textures, and temperature were used as predictive indicators. Correlation analysis was used to explore the relationships between remote sensing variables and population, and stepwise regression analysis was then used to develop models for estimating population quantities. Two sampling schemes (non-stratified versus stratified sampling) were compared. It was found that the integration of textures, temperatures, and spectral responses substantially improved the accuracy of estimation. Stratification of the population into three categories of low-, medium-, and high-densities and development of different models for individual population density category provided better estimation results than a non-stratified scheme. The total population for City of Indianapolis was estimated to be 832,792 in 2000 yielding an accuracy of 96.8 percent."

At this grid cell resolution (comprised of 400 1-km pixels), 97 percent of the grid cells included three or fewer land cover classes. FGREEN was found to vary regionally due to local land cover and climate variations. FGREEN was found significantly different between one or more of the land cover classes, for one or more months, in 58 percent of the grid cells included in the study. Monthly FGREEN values for the land cover classes vary sufficiently between the land cover classes to warrant monthly FGREEN data for each of the one to three most dominant land cover classes per grid cell."

In this study, spectral mixture analysis was used to convert a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image into green vegetation, shade, and soil fraction images. Entropy was used to analyze the complexity of forest stand structure and to examine impacts of different stand structures on TM reflectance data. The relationships between AGB and fraction images or TM spectral signatures were investigated based on successional and primary forests, respectively, and AGB estimation models were developed for both types of forests. Our findings indicate that the AGB estimation models using fraction images perform better for successional forest biomass estimation than using TM spectral signatures. However, both models based on TM spectral signatures and fractions provided poor performance for primary forest biomass estimation. The complex stand structure and associated canopy shadow greatly reduced relationships between AGB and TM reflectance or fraction images."

Yet, there is no agreed procedure for doing that, probably because different problems require different algorithms. We explored a variety of existing algorithms and modified some of them to compare grid-based maps with categorical attributes. A new algorithm based on the “expanding window” approach was developed and compared to other known algorithms. The goal was to offer simple and flexible procedures for comparing spatial patterns in grid based maps that do not take into consideration object shapes and sizes of the maps. The difference between maps was characterized by three values: quantity, location, and distance between corresponding categories in the maps. Combinations of these indices work as good criteria to quantify differences between maps. A web-based survey was set up, in which participants were asked to grade the similarity of ten pairs of maps. These results were then used to compare how well the various algorithms can perform relative to the visual comparisons obtained; they were also used to calibrate existing algorithms."
"Effects of Terrain Morphology, Sampling Density, and Interpolation Methods on Grid DEM Accuracy","Aguilar, Fernando J.; Agüera, Francisco; Aguilar, Manuel A.; Carvajal, Fernando",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000007/art00001;jsessionid=2ik9tjnkp2m2c.x-ic-live-03,"This paper explores the effects of terrain morphology, sampling density, and interpolation methods for scattered sample data on the accuracy of interpolated heights in grid Digital Elevation Models (DEM). Sampled data were collected with a 2 by 2 meters sampling interval from seven different morphologies, applying digital photogrammetric methods to large scale aerial stereo imagery (1:5000). The experimental design was outlined using a factorial scheme, and an analysis of variance was carried out. This analysis yielded the following main conclusions: DEM accuracy (RMSE) is affected significantly by the variables studied in this paper according to “morphology>sampling density>interpolation” method. Multiquadric Radial Basis Function (RBF) was rated as the best interpolation method, although Multilog RBF performed similarly for most morphologies. The rest of RBF interpolants tested (Natural Cubic Splines, Inverse Multiquadric, and Thin Plate Splines) showed numerical instability working with low smoothing factors. Inverse Distance Weighted interpolant performed worse than RBF Multiquadric or RBF Multilog. In addition, it is found that the relationship between the RMSE and the sampling density N is adjusted to a decreasing potential function that may be expressed as RMSE/Sdz=0.1906(N/M)−0.5684(R2=0.8578), being Sdz the standard deviation of the heights of the M check points used for accuracy estimation, and N the number of sampling points used for creating the DEM. The results obtained in this study allow us to observe the possibility of establishing empirical relationships between the RMSE expected in the interpolation of a Grid DEM and such variables as terrain ruggedness, sampling density, and the interpolation method, among others that could be added. Therefore, it would be possible to establish a priori the optimum grid size required to generate or storage a DEM of a particular accuracy, with the economy in computing time and file size that this would signify for the digital flow of the mapping information."
An Evaluation of Lidar-derived Elevation and Terrain Slope in Leaf-off Conditions,"Hodgson, Michael E.; Jensen, John; Raber, George; Tullis, Jason; Davis, Bruce A.; Thompson, Gary; Schuckman, Karen",pp. 817-823(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000007/art00002;jsessionid=2ik9tjnkp2m2c.x-ic-live-03,"The effects of land cover and surface slope on lidar-derived elevation data were examined for a watershed in the pied-mont of North Carolina. Lidar data were collected over the study area in a winter (leaf-off) overflight. Survey-grade elevation points (1,225) for six different land cover classes were used as reference points. Root mean squared error (RMSE) for land cover classes ranged from 14.5 cm to 36.1 cm. Land cover with taller canopy vegetation exhibited the largest errors. The largest mean error (36.1 cm RMSE) was in the scrub-shrub cover class. Over the small slope range (0° to 10°) in this study area, there was little evidence for an increase inelevationerror with increased slopes. However, for low grass land cover, elevation errors do increase in a consistent manner with increasing slope. Slopeerrors increased with increasing surface slope, under-predicting true slope on surface slopes>2°. On average, the lidar-derived elevation under-predicted true elevation regardless of land cover category. The under-prediction was significant, and ranged up to −23.6 cm under pine land cover."
"Structural Damage Assessments from Ikonos Data Using Change Detection, Object-Oriented Segmentation, and Classification Techniques","Al-Khudhairy, D.H.A.; Caravaggi, I.; Giada, S.",pp. 825-837(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000007/art00003;jsessionid=2ik9tjnkp2m2c.x-ic-live-03,"Recent improvements in the spatial resolution of commercial satellite imagery make it possible to apply very high-resolution (VHR) satellite data for assessing structural damage in the aftermath of humanitarian crises, such as, armed conflicts. Visual interpretation of pre- and post-crisis very high-resolution satellite imagery is the most straightforward method for discriminating structural damage and assessing its extent. However, the feasibility of using visual interpretation alone diminishes in the cases of large and dense urban settlements and spatial resolutions in the range of 2 m to 3 meters and larger. Visual interpretation can be further complicated at spatial resolutions greater than 1 m if accompanied by shadow formation and differences in sensor and solar conditions between the pre- and post-conflict images.In this study, we address these problems through investigating the use of traditional change techniques, namely, image differencing and principle component analysis, with an object-oriented image classification software, e-Cognition. Pre-conflict Ikonos (2 m resolution) images of Jenin in the Palestinian territories and Brest (1 m resolution) in FYROM were classified using the e-Cognition software. Thereafter, the pre-conflict classification was used to guide the classification, using e-Cognition, of the pixel-based change detection analysis. The second part of the study examines the feasibility of using mathematical morphological operators to automatically identify likely structurally damaged zones in dense urban settings. The overall results are promising and show that object-oriented segmentation and classification systems facilitate the interpretation of change detection results derived from very high-resolution (1 m and 2 m) commercial satellite data. The results show that object-oriented classification techniques enhance quantitative analysis of traditional pixel-based change detection applied to very high-resolution satellite data and facilitate the interpretation of changes in urban features. Finally, the results suggest that mathematical morphological methods are a potential new avenue for automatically extracting likely damaged zones from very high-resolution satellite imagery in the aftermath of disasters."

Following an initial random allocation of “soft” pixel proportions to “hard” sub-pixel binary classes, the algorithm works in a series of iterations, each of which contains three stages. For each pixel, for all sub-pixel locations, a distance-weighted function of neighboring sub-pixels is computed. Then, for each pixel, the sub-pixel representing the target class with the minimum value of the function, and the sub-pixel representing the background with the maximum value of the function are found. Third, these two sub-pixels are swapped if the swap results in an increase in spatial correlation between sub-pixels. The new algorithm predicted accurately when applied to simple simulated and real images. It represents an accessible tool that can be coded and applied readily by remote sensing investigators."

Lidar (Light Detection And Ranging) has become well recognized in the geomatics community since the late 1990s. Compared with traditional photogrammetry, lidar has advantages in measuring surface in terms of accuracy and density, automation, and fast delivery time. There is a large market in geo-data acquisition and object recognition for lidar technology (Baltsavias, 1999). In a general sense, lidar is a companion technology for traditional photogrammetry. The direct product that can be derived from lidar data is the DSM (Digital Surface Model), which depicts the topography of the earth’s surface, including objects above the terrain. Further processing can be carried out to generate DEM (Digital Terrain Model) and object models like buildings, which is very useful information in telecommunication, city planning, flood control, and tourism. Morphology and classification are two commonly used methods in DEM generation and object reconstruction. However, these two methods are either sensitive to errors or of low accuracy. In this paper, a new method is proposed to extract ground points for DEM generation and to detect points belonging to buildings. A new method for boundary regularization is also proposed. The results show that buildings can be detected with high accuracy from lidar data."

Systems for automated building reconstruction fail in many cases due to complexities involved in the data including image noise, occlusion, shadow, and low contrast, as well as, low accuracy or density of height data. In this paper, the problem of overgrown and undergrown regions in the segmentation of aerial images is discussed, and a split-and-merge technique is presented to overcome this problem by making use of height data. This technique is based on splitting image regions whose associated height points do not fall in a single plane, and merging coplanar neighboring regions. A robust plane-fitting method is used to fit planar surfaces to height points that are highly contaminated by gross errors. Final roof planes are extracted out of the image planar regions by checking their slope and height over a morphologically opened DSM. An experimental evaluation is conducted, and its results indicate the capability of the proposed technique in splitting overgrown regions, merging undergrown coplanar regions, and selecting the final roof planes. Also, the method is shown to be computationally efficient, and the reconstructed roof planes are of acceptable accuracy."
Theoretical Analysis of the Iterative Photogrammetric Method to Determining Ground Coordinates from Photo Coordinates and a DEM,"Sheng, Yongwei",pp. 863-871(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000007/art00007;jsessionid=2ik9tjnkp2m2c.x-ic-live-03,"It is necessary to determine ground coordinates from a single aerial image and a digital elevation model (DEM). A widely used method in photogrammetry is to iteratively calculate the coordinates based on the inverse collinearity equations. The iterative photogrammetric method may be divergent when the terrain surface becomes complicated. However, there is a lack of theoretical analysis of this method. This paper theoretically analyzes the convergence condition and the convergence speed of the method, and validates the theory using a simulated surface containing various slope conditions. The elevation angle Θ of the view ray and the inclination angle α of the profile, intersected by the terrain surface and the vertical view plane, play a critical role in the method. The necessary and sufficient condition for convergence is α < Θ. The convergence speed is quantified as a function of α, Θ, the convergence threshold ΔT and the offset ΔZ0of initial elevation estimate."

Our approach seemed to work well with a computer-assisted approach where the “seed” or potential pixels of interest should have a high confidence level of being correct. We found that our approach led to an effective method for detecting roads in aerial imagery. Our method is general, and in principle could be applied to other filtering techniques besides the one used here."
Photogrammetric and Lidar Data Registration Using Linear Features,"Habib, Ayman; Ghanma, Mwafag; Morgan, Michel; Al-Ruzouq, Rami",pp. 699-707(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000006/art00002;jsessionid=ld59x0sk2nro.x-ic-live-01,"The enormous increase in the volume of datasets acquired by lidar systems is leading towards their extensive exploitation in a variety of applications, such as, surface reconstruction, city modeling, and generation of perspective views. Though being a fairly new technology, lidar has been influenced by and had a significant impact on photogrammetry. Such an influence or impact can be attributed to the complementary nature of the information provided by the two systems. For example, photogrammetric processing of imagery produces accurate information regarding object space break lines (discontinuities). On the other hand, lidar provides accurate information describing homogeneous physical surfaces. Hence, it proves logical to combine data from the two sensors to arrive at a more robust and complete reconstruction of 3D objects. This paper introduces alternative approaches for the registration of data captured by photogrammetric and lidar systems to a common reference frame. The first approach incorporates lidar features as control for establishing the datum in the photogrammetric bundle adjustment. The second approach starts by manipulating the photogrammetric imagery to produce a 3D model, including a set of linear features along object space discontinuities, relative to an arbitrarily chosen coordinate system. Afterwards, conjugate photogrammetric and lidar straight-line features are used to establish the transformation between the arbitrarily chosen photogrammetric coordinate system and the lidar reference frame. The second approach (bundle adjustment, followed by similarity transformation) is general enough to be applied for the co-registration of multiple three-dimensional datasets regardless of their origin (e.g., adjacent lidar strips, surfaces in GIS databases, and temporal elevation data). The registration procedure would allow for the identification of inconsistencies between the surfaces in question. Such inconsistencies might arise from changes taking place within the object space or inaccurate calibration of the internal characteristics of the lidar and the photogrammetric systems. Therefore, the proposed methodology is useful for change detection and system calibration applications. Experimental results from aerial and terrestrial datasets proved the feasibility of the suggested methodologies."
Mapping Detailed Biotic Communities in the Upper San Pedro Valley of Southeastern Arizona Using Landsat 7 ETM+ Data and Supervised Spectral Angle Classifier,"Sohn, Youngsinn; Qi, Jiaguo",pp. 709-718(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000006/art00003;jsessionid=ld59x0sk2nro.x-ic-live-01,"In this study, we demonstrated that ecologically meaningful, detailed biotic communities can be mapped with high accuracy (85 percent) in a soil dominated semi-arid environment using a simple supervised classification approach with Landsat TM data, if an appropriate classification algorithm and truly representative training signatures are applied. We used the Supervised Spectral Angle Classifier by Sohn and Rebello (2002) to map biotic communities in the Upper San Pedro Valley, Arizona. By choosing an image acquisition date (season) that can maximize the differentiation of feature characteristics associated with each biotic community, and adopting the Supervised Spectral Angle Classifier that is sensitive to the spectral shape pattern, we were able to map biotic communities without the secondary, derived variables such as DEM, soil, and seasonal NDVI, seasonal greenness indices to incorporate environmental factors and phenological changes of vegetation into the classification procedures. Biotic communities and land cover categories mapped in this study include: Chihuahuan desert-scrub, mesquite scrub, Chihuahuan semi-desert grassland (<30 percent grass-forbs cover density, >30 percent grass-forbs cove density, and disclimax), Madrean encinal woodland, Madrean montane conifer forest, mesquite bosque, riparian gallery, irrigated pasture/golf course, urban/developed, bare soil, and water. Our study reaffirmed that the Spectral Angle Classifier can potentially be one of the most robust and accurate classifiers. Also, according to our study, the current spatial, spectral, and radiometric characteristics of Landsat TM data seem effective for mapping detailed vegetation communities even in a semi-arid environment."
Analysis of Urban Land Cover and Population Density in the United States,"Pozzi, Francesca; Small, Christopher",pp. 719-726(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000006/art00004;jsessionid=ld59x0sk2nro.x-ic-live-01,"In this study we investigate the question of whether urban and suburban areas in the United States can be defined on the basis of demographic and/or physical characteristics, in particular, population density and vegetation abundance. We investigate their relationship in the cities of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Phoenix, and Seattle and compare the results with the USGS National Land Cover Dataset’s urban classes. The bimodal distribution of U.S. population density provides a demographic basis for distinguishing rural and suburban land use, while a distinct tail of high population densities (>10,000 people/km2) corresponds to high intensity urban residential cores. Results show that the maximum vegetation fraction diminishes with increasing population density, but the spectral heterogeneity at pixel scales still results in a wide range of vegetation fractions within demographically urban and suburban areas. None of the USGS residential classes show a strong correspondence to either vegetation fraction or population density. However, quantitative characterization of vegetation abundance provides a basis for comparison of the physical environments of suburban areas. We suggest that classification schemes based on spectral heterogeneity at multiple pixel scales, supplemented by auxiliary data sources, may provide a more accurate and self-consistent way to quantify urban land use and analyze urban growth than traditional thematic classification schemes."
A Photogrammetric Method for Single Image Orientation and Measurement,"Maria, Antonio; Tommaselli, Garcia; Luis, Mário; Reiss, Lopes",pp. 727-732(6),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000006/art00005;jsessionid=ld59x0sk2nro.x-ic-live-01,"The aim of this paper is to present a photogrammetric method for determining the dimensions of flat surfaces, such as billboards, based on a single digital image. A mathematical model was adapted to generate linear equations for vertical and horizontal lines in the object space. These lines are identified and measured in the image and the rotation matrix is computed using an indirect method. The distance between the camera and the surface is measured using a lasermeter, providing the coordinates of the camera perspective center. Eccentricity of the lasermeter center related to the camera perspective center is modeled by three translations, which are computed using a calibration procedure. Some experiments were performed to test the proposed method and the achieved results are within a relative error of about 1 percent in areas and distances in the object space. This accuracy fulfills the requirements of the intended applications."

Such cameras require careful calibration to determine their metric characteristics, as defined by the Interior Orientation Parameters (IOP), which are essential for any photogrammetric activity. Moreover, the stability of the estimated IOP of these cameras over short and long time periods has to be analyzed and quantified. This paper outlines the incorporation of straight lines in a bundle adjustment procedure for calibrating off-the-shelf/low-cost digital cameras. A framework for automatic extraction of the straight lines in the images is also presented and tested. In addition, the research introduces new approaches for testing the camera stability, where the degree of similarity between reconstructed bundles using two sets of IOP is quantitatively evaluated. Experimental results with real data proved the feasibility of the line-based self-calibration approach. Analysis of the estimated IOP from various calibration sessions over long time periods revealed the stability of the implemented camera."

Concepts that originate from 2D data structures are used for modeling complex 3D objects and for handling datasets with different point densities. Realizing these shortcomings, this paper proposes a new neighborhood system for airborne laser data. Based on laser data characteristics the proposed systems consider, among other features, point density, layered and overhanging structures, and local surface trends. Parameters for the proposed systems are derived from theoretical and practical observations. The paper demonstrates the type of neighborhood that is established by the proposed systems, and shows that artifacts that are usually created by the common neighborhoods are avoided here, and that structures within the data that are usually masked are revealed. The paper demonstrates how subsequent applications benefit from the new system. Finally, the estimation of surface normals by the proposed systems is compared to the triangulation; results show a significant improvement in the reliability and quality of the estimation."
A Robust Technique for Precise Registration of Radar and Optical Satellite Images,"Hong, Tai D.; Schowengerdt, Robert A.",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000005/art00001;jsessionid=1ftdm6m8xwrht.x-ic-live-02,"Combining data from different sensors for visual or classification analysis is a common task in remote sensing. The first step is normally to register the images which may be considered geometric integration; the accuracy of this step is important to create a valuable final hybrid image. This paper addresses geometric integration and introduces a new method for automatically registering two dissimilar images, such as, a radar image and an optical image with high accuracy. Pre-registration of the two images to within a specified tolerance is required. In our examples, this tolerance is up to 17 pixels (at the scale of the higher resolution image) and may be achieved by, for example, visually located control points. The described approach then uses large-scale edge gradient contours in a process that automatically locates candidate control points on the contours. The points are selected using a cost function that measures the degree of match between all possible pairs of points. Numerous control points (typically around 50 pairs) are found from matched pairs of gradient contours and used in a global, rubber sheet, polynomial warp to refine the registration. This approach is applied to register a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image (ERS2, 12.5 m pixels) and a Thematic Mapper (TM) optical image (Landsat-5, 28.5 m pixels) automatically. Several examples with different scene content are shown to validate the approach and discussed in terms of residual registration error and processing efficiency."

Four individual bands (blue, green, red, and NIR) and five image transformations namely the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index – Green (NDVI-green), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Photosynthetic Vigor Ratio (PVR) and Plant Pigment Ratio (PPR) of DMSI were investigated. Canola density was correlated with the four individual bands and five image transformations, while the LAI was correlated with the four individual bands.The NDVI-green, red and near-infrared bands of DMSI produced the best correlations with the density of canola, whereas the LAI had significant (α = 0.05) negative correlations with the blue (—0.93) and red (—0.89) DMSI bands, and a significant positive correlation were found with the nearinfrared band (0.82)."
Field Determination of Optimal Dates for the Discrimination of Invasive Wetland Plant Species Using Derivative Spectral Analysis,"Laba, Magdeline; Tsai, Fuan; Ogurcak, Danielle; Smith, Stephen; Richmond, Milo E.",pp. 603-611(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000005/art00003;jsessionid=1ftdm6m8xwrht.x-ic-live-02,"Mapping invasive plant species in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems helps to understand the causes of their progression, manage some of their negative consequences, and control them. In recent years, a variety of new remote-sensing techniques, like Derivative Spectral Analysis (DSA) of hyperspectral data, have been developed to facilitate this mapping. A number of questions related to these techniques remain to be addressed. This article attempts to answer one of these questions: Is the application of DSA optimal at certain times of the year? Field radiometric data gathered weekly during the summer of 1999 at selected field sites in upstate New York, populated with purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria L.), common reed (Phragmites australis (Cav.)) and cattail (Typha L.) are analyzed using DSA to differentiate among plant community types. First, second and higher-order derivatives of the reflectance spectra of nine field plots, varying in plant composition, are calculated and analyzed in detail to identify spectral ranges in which one or more community types have distinguishing features. On the basis of the occurrence and extent of these spectral ranges, experimental observations suggest that a satisfactory differentiation among community types was feasible on 30 August, when plants experienced characteristic phenological changes (transition from flowers to seed heads). Generally, dates in August appear optimal from the point of view of species differentiability and could be selected for image acquisitions. This observation, as well as the methodology adopted in this article, should provide a firm basis for the acquisition of hyperspectral imagery and for mapping the targeted species over a broad range of spatial scales."
Remote Sensing of Urban Heat Islands by Day and Night,"Nichol, Janet",pp. 613-621(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000005/art00004;jsessionid=1ftdm6m8xwrht.x-ic-live-02,"A night-time thermal image from the ASTER satellite sensor, of the western New territories of Hong Kong is compared with a daytime Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) thermal image obtained nineteen days earlier. Densely built high rise areas which appear cool on daytime images are conversely, relatively warm on nighttime images, though the temperature differences are not well developed at night. Lower temperature gradients between different land cover types observed on the night time image result in meso-scale, rather than micro-scale climatic patterns being dominant, suggestive of processes operating in the Urban Boundary Layer (UBL), as opposed to the Urban Canopy Layer (UCL) which is dominant in the daytime. Thus, at night, proximity to extensive cool surfaces such as forested mountain slopes appears to be influential in maintaining cooler building temperatures. The relevance of satellite-derived surface temperatures for studies of urban microclimate is supported by field data of surface and air temperatures collected in the study area. Comparison of the ASTER Kinetic Temperature standard product with a thermal image processed using locally derived emissivity and atmospheric data indicated higher accuracy for the latter."

An extended header structure was developed that allows facet indexing using geographic latitude and longitude. Three algorithms were developed in a C/C++ programming environment that performs new layer creation, accessing facet values, and importing image data in other projections. The output of this research can be considered for archiving global-scale satellite imagery and for publishing global-scale thematic raster datasets such as land cover and population density."

Like any extrapolation, it is sensitive to random and systematic errors, as well as, to improper data handling.Direct sensor orientation is based on the combination of an Inertial Measurement System (IMU) and GPS. The GPS antenna, the IMU, and the imaging sensor are located in different positions, and the latter two have different orientations. Therefore, the calibration of all sensors and the relation between the sensors is of vital importance for precise ground positioning. The system calibration includes the determination of the boresight misalignment, the interior camera orientation, and the GPS antenna offset. A rigorous mathematical model is required. The inner orientation of the camera used has to be determined under flight conditions to achieve sufficient results. In this paper, the influence of the system calibration to the direct sensor orientation and improper data handling will be shown."

Imaging sensors, most frequently supported by the DPO technique, are digital cameras, lidar systems, multi-spectral or hyper-spectral scanners, or interferometric synthetic aperture radar (INSAR). While for scanning sensors the use of DPO is compulsory, frame digital cameras can also directly benefit from this modern technique of sensor orientation. With direct sensor orientation, the requirement for ground control, tie-point matching and aerotriangulation (AT) is significantly reduced, or even entirely eliminated, resulting in shorter times of data acquisition and processing, and streamlined and highly automated data workflow and quality control. Most of the time, the requirement for ground control points is limited to periodic system calibrations and quality control check. Direct georeferencing is considered a fundamental technology of conventional mobile mapping systems (MMS).Despite significant progress in GSP/INS-based direct georeferencing technology in the last decade, there is still room for improvement in terms of better accuracy and better tolerance to GPS outages. This paper is focused on three error modeling and compensation techniques that could potentially improve GPS/INS system’s performance on both land-based and airborne platforms: (1) extended gravity compensation, (2) IMU signal de-noising, and (3) stochastic modeling of IMU errors."

It is a fairly simple system comprised of an analogical video camera and two kinematic GPS rover receivers. One GPS antenna is located close to the camera and used to locate the camera at the time of the image acquisition. The second antenna is suspended underneath the helicopter. It functions as a flown control point and appears in all the video images. Thus, a photogrammetric model or strip is created in which the coordinates of the exposure point and of one of its image points are always known in all the photographs. The solution process for such a photogrammetric model or strip is presented, as well as, the results and accuracy of the experiments that were carried out to test the system."

The algorithm consists of color segmentation based on locally adaptive thresholding extraction of regions of interest (ROI) using a depth-first-search algorithm, followed by speed limit sign detection and speed limit number extraction by means of optical character recognition and 2D correlation.

This paper contributes to a method of fusing the data output of VLMS with existing geographic data sources where the focus is on the rectification of the vehicle’s motion data derived from GPS/INS, which may be quite erroneous in an urban area. An algorithm is developed to correct the four variables of the vehicle’s motion data, i.e., x, y, and z coordinates of the vehicle position and yaw angle of orientation by registering the laser points of the VLMS with an existing data source, e.g., a DSM. The algorithm was examined using the VLMS data that were taken in the Ginza District, Tokyo. By manually assigning 18 sets of tiepoints, the vehicle’s motion data were corrected automatically and efficiently, such that the laser points of VLMS were matched to a DSM. In data fusion, a set of objects, which contained commercial signboards, traffic signs and signals, road boundaries, and road lights were extracted from the corrected VLMS data using an interface described in a previous paper. They were integrated with a 1:2500 3D map that consists of only building frames. In addition, line images from the VLMS were projected onto the building facades of the 3D map, and textures were generated automatically."

Therefore, conventional solutions need an expert operator to try different terms and orders for the best solution of GSMs or to find the best trade-off, which is a complex and time consuming process. Moreover, conventional solutions for automatic determination of the optimum GSM parameters are not practically efficient and instead of going towards the global optimum, frequently get trapped in some local optima. In this paper we propose a novel methodology which automatically determines the optimum GSM’s terms and orders based on genetic algorithm concepts. Extensive evaluations carried out on a wide range of different optical satellite images demonstrate the high potentials of the proposed strategy."
"Textural Discrimination of an Invasive Plant,Schinus terebinthifolius, from Low Altitude Aerial Digital Imagery","Pearlstine, Leonard; Portier, Kenneth M.; Smith, Scot E.",pp. 289-298(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000003/art00003;jsessionid=1kkhwl3j2vmm2.x-ic-live-02,"Schinus terebinthifolius,known as Brazilian pepper, is an exotic, invasive plant species in Florida that displaces native plant species and disrupts wildlife habitat. Aerial surveys typically used to monitor ecosystem change may be augmented with texture analyses to improve the speed and consistency with whichS. terebinthifoliusis detected in the images. Image processing using high-resolution imagery can take advantage of high spectral variability in adjacent pixels of the same cover type by measuring spatial patterns of texture in neighborhoods of pixels.Texture features derived from first and second-order statistics and edge components in high-resolution digital color infrared images were tested for their ability to discriminateS. terebinthifolius.Multiple linear logistic regressions found a best subset combination of texture features that consistently identified core areas ofS. terebinthifolius.Misclassification of other cover types asS. terebinthifoliuswas low except whereSabal palmettowas present in the images."
Leaf Optical Property Changes Associated with the Occurrence ofSpartina alternifloraDieback in Coastal Louisiana Related to Remote Sensing Mapping,"Ramsey III, Elijah; Rangoonwala, Amina",pp. 299-311(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000003/art00004;jsessionid=1kkhwl3j2vmm2.x-ic-live-02,"In order to provide a remote sensing solution that would detect both the initial onset and monitor the early, as well as, the later stages of impact progression, changes in live leaf optical properties were compared along transects spanning impacted coastal Louisiana marsh sites. Green and red edge reflectance trends generally represented the early stages and fairly well the later stages of dieback progression, while blue and red reflectance and absorption trends represented the later stages of marsh impact that were most closely related to visible signs of marsh impact. Leaf reflectance in the near infrared (NIR) was not compatible with visual reflectance trends and did not co-vary with derived indicators of leaf water content, and thereby, water stress. Predicted from reflectance ratios, carotene tended to remain constant or increase relative to chlorophyll following noted changes in stressed plants at the two least impacted sites, while the pigments co-varied at the two most impacted sites. As an operational solution most amenable for satellite remote sensing, theNIR/red ratio followed blue and red reflectance trends while theNIR/green ratio mimicked the green and red edge reflectance trends indicating impact onset and progression, as well as, generally portraying blue and red reflectance trends indicating later stages of impact. The NIR/ green ratio magnitude and range generally increased from the most to least impacted site providing a convenient method to detect dieback onset and monitor dieback progression. This research demonstrated that remote sensing mapping at these sites could offer a more accurate perception of dieback severity distribution than offered by determinations relying on visible indicators of marsh changes."
Comparison of Three Algorithms for Filtering Airborne Lidar Data,"Zhang, Keqi; Whitman, Dean",pp. 313-324(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000003/art00005;jsessionid=1kkhwl3j2vmm2.x-ic-live-02,"This paper compares three methods for removing non-ground measurements from airborne laser scanning data. These methods, including the elevation threshold with expanding window (ETEW), maximum local slope (MLS), and progressive morphological (PM) filters, analyze data points based on variations of local slope, and elevation. Low and high-relief data sets with various densities of trees, houses, and sand dunes were selected to test the filtering methods. The results show that all three methods can effectively remove most non-ground points in both low-relief urban and high-relief forested areas. The PM filter generated the best result in coastal barrier island areas, whereas the other algorithms tended to remove the tops of steep sand dunes. Each method experienced various omission or commission errors, depending on the filtering parameters. Topographic slope is the most sensitive parameter for the three filtering methods."
Semi-Automatic Registration of Multi-Source Satellite Imagery with Varying Geometric Resolutions,"Habib, Ayman; Al-Ruzouq, Rami",pp. 325-332(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000003/art00006;jsessionid=1kkhwl3j2vmm2.x-ic-live-02,"Image registration is concerned with the problem of how to combine data and/or information from multiple sensors in order to achieve improved accuracies and better inference about the environment than could be attained through the use of a single sensor. Registration of imagery and information from multiple sources is essential for a variety of applications in remote sensing, medical diagnosis, computer vision, and pattern recognition. In general, an image registration methodology must deal with four issues. First, a decision has to be made regarding the choice of primitives for the registration procedure. The second issue is concerned with establishing the registration transformation function that mathematically relates geometric attributes of corresponding primitives. Then, a similarity measure should be devised to ensure the correspondence of conjugate primitives. Finally, a matching strategy has to be designed and implemented as a controlling framework that utilizes the primitives, the similarity measure, and the transformation function to solve the registration problem. This paper outlines a comprehensive investigation and implementation of the involved issues in a semi-automatic registration procedure capable of handling multi-source satellite imagery with varying geometric resolutions."
Nested Hyper-Rectangle Learning Model for Remote Sensing,"Chen, Li",pp. 333-340(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000003/art00007;jsessionid=1kkhwl3j2vmm2.x-ic-live-02,"This study presents an exemplar-based nested hyper-rectangle learning model (NHLM) which is an efficient and accurate supervised classification model. The proposed model is based on the concept of seeding training data in the Euclidean m-space (where m denotes the number of features) as hyper-rectangles. To express the exceptions, these hyper-rectangles may be nested inside one another to an arbitrary depth. The fast and one-shot learning procedures can adjust weights dynamically when new examples are added. Furthermore, the “second chance” heuristic is introduced in NHLM to avoid creating more memory objects than necessary. NHLM is applied to solving the land cover classification problem in Taiwan using remote sensed imagery. The study investigated five land cover classes and clouds. These six classes were chosen from field investigation of the study area according to previous study. Therefore, this paper aims to produce a land cover classification based on SPOT HRV spectral data. Compared with a standard back-propagation neural network (BPN), the experimental results indicate that NHLM provides a powerful tool for categorizing remote sensing data."
Automated Mapping of Stream Features with High-Resolution Multispectral Imagery,"Leckie, Donald G.; Cloney, Ed; Jay, Cara; Paradine, Dennis",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000002/art00001;jsessionid=151jwx3qxe5ja.x-ic-live-03,"The capabilities of high-resolution, multispectral remote sensing imagery to map important stream features is investigated. Eighty centimeter spatial resolution CASI imagery was acquired in eight spectral bands over Tofino Creek on the west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. A spectral angle mapping algorithm was used to classify stream habitat including hydraulic habitat, substrate material, and woody debris. Subclasses were attempted in terms of streambed material and water depth, but results were not reliable. A classification of deep water, moderate depth water, shallow water, sand, gravel and cobble, and woody debris in sunlit conditions, however, proved accurate (80 percent on average). Individual logs and piles of woody debris were consistently detected. Silty substrate in a tidal flats zone was also classified, but results indicated that different substrate material beneath the water may require separate classes and can result in problematic water depth classification. Patterns of general classes were reasonably represented within shadowed areas cast by isolated trees or groups of trees. However, problems do arise within lengthy shadowed stretches. Some boundaries of stream features with surrounding forest and between some zones of sand, gravel, and cobble were also misclassified. High-resolution, multispectral imagery in four or more bands combined with good geometric correction, image mosaicking, and appropriate automatic classification techniques offer a viable tool for stream mapping to meet a variety of issues and applications. In the future, a powerful suite of stream information may be compiled from multispec-tral classification combined with high-resolution thermal and lidar data."
Effects of JPEG2000 on the Information and Geometry Content of Aerial Photo Compression,"Liu, Jung-Kuan; Wu, Houn-Chien; Shih, Tian-Yuan",pp. 157-167(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000002/art00002;jsessionid=151jwx3qxe5ja.x-ic-live-03,"The standardization effort of the next ISO standard for compression of the still image, JPEG2000, has recently reached International Standard (IS) status. This wavelet-based standard outperforms the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) based JPEG in terms of compression ratio, as well as, quality. In this study, the performance of JPEG2000 is evaluated for aerial image compressions. Different compression ratios are applied to scanned aerial photos at the 1:5 000 scale. Both the image quality measurements and the accuracy of photogrammetric point determination aspects are examined. The evaluation of image quality is based on visual analysis of the objects in the scene and on the computation of numerical indices, including RMSE, entropy, and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). The geometric quality of JPEG2000 with different compression ratios is studied for some photogrammetric operations, including interior orientation, relative orientation, absolute orientation, and DSM generation. The objective of this study is to explore the possibility of JPEG2000 for replacing JPEG as a standard in photogrammetric operations."
Shadow Analysis in High-Resolution Satellite Imagery of Urban Areas,"Dare, Paul M.",pp. 169-177(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000002/art00003;jsessionid=151jwx3qxe5ja.x-ic-live-03,"High-resolution satellite imagery (HRSI) offers great possibilities for urban mapping. Unfortunately, shadows cast by buildings in high-density urban environments obscure much of the information in the image leading to potentially corrupted classification results or blunders in interpretation. Although significant research has been carried out on the subject of shadowing in remote sensing, very few studies have focused on the particular problems associated with high-resolution satellite imaging of urban areas. This paper reviews past and current research and proposes a solution to the problem of automatic detection and removal of shadow features. Tests show that although detection and removal of shadow features can lead to improved image quality, results can be image-dependent."
Spatial Classification of Orchards and Vineyards with High Spatial Resolution Panchromatic Imagery,"Warner, Timothy A.; Steinmaus, Karen",pp. 179-187(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000002/art00004;jsessionid=151jwx3qxe5ja.x-ic-live-03,"New high-resolution sensors offer the potential to apply remote sensing to a new, finer scale of problems. However, the highest spatial resolution imagery typically has only a single spectral band, and therefore, classification based on spatial patterns is required. One application particularly suited to spatial classification is the identification of orchards and vineyards. Orchards and vineyards have a distinctive repeating pattern that can be identified by an analysis of local autocorrelation patterns. A classification algorithm based on an analysis of autocorrelograms was developed, and tested using Ikonos panchromatic imagery of Granger, Washington. The spatial autocorrelation-based classification resulted in an estimated accuracy of 0.954 and κ of 0.900. Errors of omission for orchards and vineyards were slightly higher than errors of commission (11–14 percent versus 3–6 percent). By comparison, a maximum likelihood classification of 32 gray level co-occurrence texture bands had a lower accuracy (0.865), with a κ of 0.701, and errors of omission and commission as high as 35 percent and 57 percent, respectively."
A Least Squares-Based Method for Adjusting the Boundaries of Area Objects,"Tong, Xiaohua; Shi, Wenzhong; Liu, Dajie",pp. 189-195(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000002/art00005;jsessionid=151jwx3qxe5ja.x-ic-live-03,"In this paper a least squares-based method is proposed for adjusting the boundaries of area objects in a GIS that is designed particularly for solving inconsistencies between the areas of digitized and registered land parcels. The principle of this approach is taking the size of the registered area of a land parcel as its true value and to adjust the geometric position of the boundaries of the digitized parcel. First, a generic area adjustment model is derived by incorporating the following two categories of constraints: (a) attribute constraint: the size of the true area of the parcel, and (b) geometric constraints: such as, straight lines, right angles and certain distances. Second, the methods used to adjust the areas of the parcels for different cases are presented. Third, the implementation of the proposed model is illustrated using several case studies. The results of the application and the corresponding analysis demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to maintain a consistency between the areas of the digitized and registered parcels. This study has solved one of the most critical problems in developing a land/cadastral information system, and this solution has been adopted in the processing of real world cadastral data in Shanghai and other cities in China."
A Least Squares Adjustment of Multi-temporal InSAR Data,"Le Mouélic, Stéphane; Raucoules, Daniel; Carnec, Claudie; King, Christine",pp. 197-204(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000002/art00006;jsessionid=151jwx3qxe5ja.x-ic-live-03,"Satellite radar interferometry can be used to spatially monitor small vertical ground deformations. When millimeter accuracy is required, the differential interferometry technique is hampered by the ambiguity with atmospheric artifacts. It is also often difficult to obtain a precise evaluation of the kinematic evolution of ground deformations from a set of time, randomly distributed interferograms. We present the results of a least-squares approach coupled with a temporal filtering and applied to a large data set over the City of Paris. The mean deformation rate and a map of areas affected by time, non-linear deformation events are presented. We show that this approach, which provides a chronologically ordered set of phase screens, allows the retrieval of the kinematic parameters of ground deformations as low as 1 to 2 mm per year. Subsiding areas have been detected, and their evolution in time has been quantified. Such an approach can be useful to fully characterize the kinematic evolution of ground deformations in major cities or desertic areas where large areas have a high degree of coherence and where millimeter accuracy is often required."
Multidimensional Management of Geospatial Data Quality Information for its Dynamic Use Within GIS,"Devillers, Rodolphe; Bédard, Yvan; Jeansoulin, Robert",pp. 205-215(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000002/art00007;jsessionid=151jwx3qxe5ja.x-ic-live-03,"Metadata should help users to assess the quality (fitness for use) of geospatial data, thus reducing the risk of data misuse. However, metadata presents limitations and remain largely unused. There still exists a need to provide information to users about data quality in a more meaningful way. This research aims to dynamically communicate quality information to the users in a rapid and intuitive way in order to reduce user meta-uncertainty related to geospatial data quality, and then reduce the risks of data misuses. Such a solution requires a data model able to support heterogeneous data quality information at different levels of analysis. Using a multidimensional database approach, this paper proposes a conceptual framework named the Quality Information Management Model (QIMM) relying on quality dimensions and measures. This allows a user to easily and rapidly navigate into the quality information using a Spatial On-Line Analytical Processing (SOLAP) client-tied to its GIS application. QIMM potential is illustrated by examples, and then a prototype and ways to communicate data quality to users are explored."
Urban DEM Generation from Raw Lidar Data,"Shan, Jie; Aparajithan, Sampath",pp. 217-226(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000002/art00008;jsessionid=151jwx3qxe5ja.x-ic-live-03,"This paper addresses the separation of ground points from raw lidar data for bald ground digital elevation model (DEM) generation in urban areas. This task is considered to be a la-beling process through which a lidar point is labeled as either a ground point or a non-ground point. Mathematical formulation is presented to define the ground. A new approach is proposed that conducts one-dimensional labeling in two opposite directions followed by a linear regression, both along the lidar scan line profile. The study shows that the one-dimensional characteristic makes the calculation efficient, and the reliability is assured by the bidirectional labeling process. Lidar data over suburban and downtown Baltimore (Maryland), Osaka (Japan), and Toronto (Canada) are used for the study. Quality assessment is designed and conducted to investigate the performance of the labeling approach by using manually-selected ground truth. It is shown that 2.7 percent ground points are wrongly labeled as building points, and 2.6 percent building points are mistakenly labeled as ground points over the four study areas. Detailed graphic and numerical results are provided to illustrate the proposed labeling approach and its performance for complex urban areas."

This paper presents a method of mapping spatial accuracy of thematic land cover maps using fuzzy sets. First, we define a multilevel agreement between reference data and corresponding pixels on the map. Next, we formulate a discrete, multi-level agreement fuzzy set regarding a particular land-cover type for each pixel on the map. Then, we construct spatial accuracy maps based on information from the multi-level agreement fuzzy sets. We illustrate the method by constructing accuracy maps of several land cover types for the Mid-Atlantic Regionregion. Results show that thematic map accuracy is not spatially homogenous, but varies across a landscape and different land cover types having different spatial patterns of accuracy. The method provides valuable information about thematic map accuracy for both scientists and decision makers, such as in designing adaptive sampling schemes, deriving landscape indicators, or thematic map-based modeling."

These OIS are defined mathematically and are based on the layout of the runways, the types of electronic navigation equipment used for each runway, and other factors. Under a series of interagency agreements, the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) is tasked with supplying obstruction survey data to the FAA.Airport obstruction surveys have traditionally been conducted using a combination of photogrammetry and conventional field survey techniques. In this study, we investigate the use of airborne laser scanning technology for this application. Specifically, we examine the effects of varying the forward look angle, laser footprint, flying height, flying speed, scan angle, scan frequency, transmitted power, and receiver sensitivity, as these parameters relate to the detection and measurement of vertical obstructions. We present results of test flights over the Gainesville Regional Airport (GNV) using fourteen different configurations of an Optech ALTM 2050. The results are compared to field-surveyed obstruction data obtained by NGS. Our analysis shows that certain configurations of the airborne laser scanning system notably improve the detection of obstructions. In this study, the best results were obtained using a 20° forward tilt angle and a 0.2 milliradian beam divergence from a flying height of 750 m. With this configuration, all obstructions were detected and the vertical accuracy (RMSE) was 0.88 m when compared to the field-surveyed obstructions."

This paper presents four indicators, quantity, quality, location, and morphology to characterize land development patterns for fast-growing regions. A four-component efficiency index is further developed for ranking purposes to reflect economic and environmental considerations. The implementation of the method has been demonstrated in a fast-growing region in south China. Efforts have been made to verify the model with independent empirical data."

Accordingly, a supervised classification approach based on the fuzzy c-means algorithm was implemented to generate fuzzy memberships of selected bands (1, 3, 4 and 7) of a Landsat-7 ETM+ image that provided the highest spectral separability among different urban land covers (e.g., forest, grassland, urban, and dense urban) as determined by a transformed divergence analysis. Maps resulting from the application of each fuzzy operator were evaluated against field data. The results show that the fuzzy algebraic product and the fuzzy gamma operators (0.1 to 0.8) are optimal for integrating the fuzzy memberships of selected urban land covers on multi-band data sets, as they exhibited a Khat statistic of 75 percent as compared to a Khat statistic of 59 percent, 64 percent and 71 percent for maximum, minimum and fuzzy algebraic sum, respectively."

The computed elevations are added to the initial contour data set. Thin plate methods are applied to all of the data. The splines allow information to flow across contours, improving the final surface. The second method successively computes new, intermediate contours in between existing isolines, which provide additional data for subsequent thin plate processing. Both methods alleviate artifacts visible in previous thin plate methods. The surfaces are tested with published methods to show qualitative and quantitative improvements over previous methods."

Existing topographic databases are additionally used in order to select time-invariant objects as checkpoints. In order to avoid blunders in the correlation, thresholds for similarity measures are applied. Detailed studies show that a combination of thresholds for the maximum correlation coefficient, the average mutual information, and distance can reduce the number of blunders in the automated measurements considerably and should therefore be applied. The calculation of DEM errors is carried out by an improved formula. The new methods and procedures are applied to two practical examples, and the results are presented."
Statistical Ratio Rank Ordered Differences Filter for SeaWiFS Impulse Noise Removal,"Liu, Zhengjun; Wang, Changyao; Liu, Aixia; Xiao, Xiangming",pp. 89-95(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2005/00000071/00000001/art00007;jsessionid=bn6jknabobek1.x-ic-live-03,"Due to the 10-bit design of SEAWIFS instrument and the signal transmission, many SEAWIFS satellite images are expected to have lower digitization noise and corrupted impulse noise. In this paper, we first analyze the characteristics of impulse noise and propose a new rank-ordered filter based on the difference of sequence for mean/standard, which is named as Statistical Ratio Rank Ordered Differences (SRROD) filter. Second, we describe the impulse noise detection and removal algorithm in detail. Compared with the median filter and other existing filters, the SRROD filter could effectively remove impulse noises while preserving other valid pixels without, or only with minor, modification. Through adjusting the lower and upper threshold values, different filter performance could be achieved. We also discuss the blind parameters optimization for non-recursive implementation. Based on the assessment of the distribution map of performance estimator ε according to different lower and upper threshold pairs, a nearly optimal threshold could be obtained. Finally, some concluding remarks are also presented in this paper."
Photogrammetric Analysis of the Mars Global Surveyor Mapping Data,"Shan, Jie; Yoon, Jong-suk; Lee, D.

Starting from the raw MGS data, we decompress the MOC narrow angle images, extract, and calculate their exterior orientation from the SPICE kernels, and calculate the 3D coordinates of MOLA footprints from MOLA PEDR files. A new approach is proposed that registers a MOLA profile to stereo MOC images over the same area with robust and faster convergence. Intersection is conducted to determine the 3D positions of image points measured on MOC stereo pairs. It is shown that there is a nearly constant uncertainty of one MOLA ground spacing distance (approximately 325 m) along the flight direction in MOC and MOLA registration. This is caused by the uncertainties in SPICE kernels, MOLA points, and the determination of time tags for MOC scan lines, which possibly constitutes the dominant error source for the registration. Intersection calculation reaches an optimal balance by distributing the uncertainty evenly in the two images of a stereo pair. As for the photogrammetric mapping capabilities, an uncertainty of 180.8 m in planimetric distance and 30.8 m in elevation difference is estimated. A number of numerical and graphic results over three of the selected candidate landing sites for the Mars Exploration Rover mission are presented for analysis and illustration."

In this approach, road extraction was performed in two steps. In the first step, support vector machine (SVM) was employed merely to classify the image into two groups of categories: aroad groupand anon-road group.For this classification, support vector machine (SVM) achieved higher accuracy than Gaussian maximum likelihood (GML). In the second step, the road group image was segmented into geometrically homogeneous objects using a region growing technique based on a similarity criterion, with higher weighting on shape factors over spectral criteria. A simple thresholding on the shape index and density features derived from these objects was performed to extract road features, which were further processed by thinning and vectorization to obtain road centerlines. The experiment showed the proposed approach worked well with images comprised by both rural and urban area features."
A Framework for Automated Extraction and Classification of Linear Networks,"Priestnall, G.; Hatcher, M.J.; Morton, R.D.; Wallace, S.J.; Ley, R.G.",pp. 1373-1382(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000012/art00003;jsessionid=k6suc407r977.x-ic-live-03,"This paper presents a framework for extracting networks of linear features such as roads from imagery using an object-oriented geodata model. The proof of concept approach has resulted in the Automated Linear Feature Identification and Extraction (ALFIE) which uses a control strategy to automate the process flow. The resulting system is highly flexible, incorporating a toolkit of algorithms and imagery to extract linear features and utilizes contextual information to allow evidence of class membership to be built up from a variety of sources. The classification algorithm employs a Bayesian modelling approach. This incorporates both geometric and photometric information of which five key discriminators were identified: width, width variation, sinuosity, spectral value, and spectral value variation. This paper presents an in-depth discussion of the processes undertaken by the ALFIE system and quantitative results of the final output from the system in terms of classification accuracy and network completeness."
A Review of Techniques for Extracting Linear Features from Imagery,"Quackenbush, Lindi J.",pp. 1383-1392(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000012/art00004;jsessionid=k6suc407r977.x-ic-live-03,"The automated extraction of linear features from remotely sensed imagery has been the subject of extensive research over several decades. Recent studies show promise for extraction of feature information for applications such as updating geographic information systems (GIS). Research has been stimulated by the increase in available imagery in recent years following the launch of several airborne and satellite sensors. However, while the expansion in the range and availability of image data provides new possibilities for deriving image related products, it also places new demands on image processing. Efficiently dealing with the vast amount of available data necessitates an increase in automation, while still taking advantage of the skills of a human operator. This paper provides an overview of the types of imagery being used for linear feature extraction. The paper also describes methods used for feature extraction and considers quantitative and qualitative accuracy assessment of these procedures."
A Robust Method for Semi-Automatic Extraction of Road Centerlines Using a Piecewise Parabolic Model and Least Square Template Matching,"Hu, Xiangyun; Zhang, Zuxun; Tao, C. Vincent",pp. 1393-1398(6),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000012/art00005;jsessionid=k6suc407r977.x-ic-live-03,"In this paper, we present a semi-automatic road extraction method based on a piecewise parabola model with 0-order continuity. The piecewise parabola model is constructed by seed points coarsely placed by a human operator. In this case, road extraction actually becomes a physical problem of solving of each piece of parabola with only two or three unknown parameters by using image constraints. We have used a least square template matching to solve the parabola parameters. The template is deformable developed based on the automatic detection of dual road edges. In addition, a method of flexible observation weight evaluation has also been developed in this matching method. Extensive testing experiments on various image sets demonstrate that the method is able to extract road centerlines reliably. It offers much higher efficiency in contrast to manual digitizing process. We also discuss some issues about semiautomatic road extraction and future work for improving the reliability and extending the availability of our method."
A Parameterization Model for Transportation Feature Extraction,"Hodgson, Michael E.; Li, Xingong; Cheng, Yang",pp. 1399-1404(6),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000012/art00006;jsessionid=k6suc407r977.x-ic-live-03,"This article presents one solution to the parameterization problem for automated road feature extraction models. Using a line-length buffer approach, a measure of agreement between extracted road features and reference road features is defined. An automated approach for deriving this agreement index is presented and implemented as a parameterization model. Coupling the implemented parameterization model with an existing transportation feature extraction model is demonstrated. Although the solution was designed for a road feature extraction model (FEM), the conceptual design could be applied to other linear FEMs, such as models for streams, fault lines, and isolines."
Automated Road Extraction from High Resolution Multispectral Imagery,"Doucette, Pete; Agouris, Peggy; Stefanidis, Anthony",pp. 1405-1416(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000012/art00007;jsessionid=k6suc407r977.x-ic-live-03,"This work presents a novel methodology for fully automated road centerline extraction that exploits spectral content from high resolution multispectral images. Preliminary detection of candidate road centerline components is performed withAnti-parallel-edge Centerline Extraction (ACE). This is followed by constructing a road vector topology with a fuzzy grouping model that links nodes from a self-organized mapping of the ACE components. Following topology construction, aSelf-Supervised Road Classification (SSRC)feedback loop is implemented to automate the process of training sample selection and refinement for a road class, as well as deriving practical spectral definitions for non-road classes. SSRC demonstrates a potential to provide dramatic improvement in road extraction results by exploiting spectral content. Road centerline extraction results are presented for three 1 m color-infrared suburban scenes which show significant improvement following SSRC."
Tracking Road Centerlines from High Resolution Remote Sensing Images by Least Squares Correlation Matching,"Kim, Taejung; Park, Seung-Ran; Kim, Moon-Gyu; Jeong, Soo; Kim, Kyung-Ok",pp. 1417-1422(6),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000012/art00008;jsessionid=k6suc407r977.x-ic-live-03,"This paper describes a semi-automatic algorithm for tracking road centerlines from satellite images at 1 m resolution. We assume that road centerlines are visible in the image and that among points on road centerlines similarity transformation holds. Previous approaches proposed for semi-automatic road extraction include energy minimization and template matching with global enforcement. In this paper we will show that least squares correlation matching alone can work for tracking road centerlines. Our algorithm works by defining a template around a user-given input point, which shall lie on a road centerline, and then by matching the template against the image along the orientation of the road under consideration. Once matching succeeds, new match proceeds by shifting a matched target window further along road orientation. By repeating the process above, we obtain a series of points, which lie on a road centerline successively. An Ikonos image over Seoul area was used for test. The algorithm could successfully extract road centerlines once valid input points were provided from a user. The contribution of this paper is that we proved template matching could offer wider applicability in feature extraction, and we designed a new template matching scheme that worked for feature extraction without global enforcements."
A Wavelet Transform Based Method for Road Centerline Extraction,"Chen, Tieling; Wang, Jinfei; Zhang, Kaizhong",pp. 1423-1431(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000012/art00009;jsessionid=k6suc407r977.x-ic-live-03,"This paper introduces a new wavelet transform based method of road centerline extraction from high resolution remote sensing images. In the one dimensional case, we characterize different kinds of sudden changes of signals by comparing the magnitudes of the local extreme values of the wavelet transforms under different dilation scales of the same wavelet. The platform-like signals, which come from cross sections of roads, can be characterized through the evolution of the wavelet transform across scales. A two-dimensional wavelet transform of an image consists of two components, each component is a one dimensional wavelet transform in one coordinate direction followed by a smoothing process in the perpendicular direction. The road edges can be characterized through the evolution of the two-dimensional wavelet transform across different scales. Edges of the main roads can then be extracted using these characterizations, and the road centerlines can be obtained by proper post-processing."

This innovative Road Extraction Assisted by Laser (REAL) can detect the road edges shadowed by surrounding high objects. A new concept of Associated Road Line (ARL) graph from LSD is introduced to enhance Real Road Line (RRL) graph from aerial photos. The extraction process consists of three steps: The first step is analysing laser images where parameters such as height and edges of high objects are obtained. Secondly, digital images are analysed where road edges are detected. It is evident that ARL and RRL graphs are homeomorphous which provides a theoretical foundation of REAL. The gaps of RRL are bridged through their ARL with a topological transformation. Finally, shadowed parts of RRL are reconstructed by a spline-approximation algorithm. The experimental results show that this approach is effective and has potential advantages."

Very high spatial-resolution, digital, multispectral imagery was acquired in three visible and one near-infrared wavelength bands along the U.S.-Mexico border using an Airborne Data Acquisition and Registration (ADAR) digital camera system mounted on a helicopter. Four image enhancement methods and one neural-network based automated feature extraction technique were tested. Measures of trail length were compared with a ground-based GPS trail survey to evaluate accuracy.The optimal image enhancement method for trail mapping varied with topography and vegetation structure. The green vegetation component from spectral mixture analysis (SMA) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were most useful for enhancing trails for subsequent interactive visual interpretation and digitizing. The neural network feature extraction technique produced superior results when combined with interactive digitizing."
Quantitatively Assessing Roads Extracted from High-Resolution Imagery,"Péteri, Renaud; Couloigner, Isabelle; Ranchin, Thierry",pp. 1449-1456(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000012/art00012;jsessionid=k6suc407r977.x-ic-live-03,Urban mapping has become a challenge for scientists since the launch of high spatial resolution satellites. This paper focuses on the problem of quality when extracting roads from such data. The definition of a judicious reference enabling the establishment of quantitative criteria is proposed. A method is presented and two sets of criteria dedicated to the evaluation of road extraction algorithms are introduced. An example of an application is proposed enhancing the benefits of a rigorous approach of this problem.
Increasing Efficiency of Road Extraction by Self-Diagnosis,"Hinz, Stefan; Wiedemann, Christian",pp. 1457-1466(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000012/art00013;jsessionid=k6suc407r977.x-ic-live-03,"In general, automatic object extraction systems may not be expected to deliver absolutely perfect results, and thus, for meeting predefined application requirements, a human operator must inspect the automatically-obtained results. In order to speed up the time- and cost-intensive inspection, the system should provide the operator with confidence values characterizing its own performance. In practice, however, this is rarely the case. In this paper, we present general ideas on the methodology and representation of internal evaluation (self-diagnosis) within automatic object extraction systems. We illustrate their implementation into two different road extraction systems, and based on a test series of aerial images, we exemplify how results attached with confidence values can increase system efficiency for practical applications. To analyze the reliability of self-diagnosis, we matched the internally-evaluated results to a manually-plotted reference. The comparison shows the benefits but also some remaining deficiencies of the self-diagnosis tool."
A Comparison of Standard and Hybrid Classifier Methods for Mapping Hardwood Mortality in Areas Affected by “Sudden Oak Death”,"Kelly, Maggi; Shaari, David; Guo, Qinghua; Liu, Desheng",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000011/art00001;jsessionid=apgbsjg31j3ci.x-ic-live-01,"The sudden oak death (SOD) epidemic in California has resulted in hundreds of thousands of dead trees in the complex of oak(Quercus)and tanoak(Lithocarpus)woodland that exist in patches along the California coast. Monitoring SOD occurrence and spread is an on-going necessity in the state. Remote sensing methods have proved to be successful in mapping and monitoring forest health and distribution when a sufficiently small ground resolution is used. Supervised, unsupervised, and “hybrid” classification methods were evaluated for their accuracy in discriminating dead and dying tree crowns from bare areas and the surrounding forest mosaic utilizing 1-m ADAR imagery covering both tanoak/redwood forest and mixed hardwood stands. In both study areas the hybrid classifier significantly outperformed the other methods, producing low omission and commission errors among information classes. The hybrid method was then further refined by varying three parameters of the algorithm (iteration number, homogeneity threshold, and number of classes) and accuracy was assessed. The results demonstrate that while the hybrid method outperformed the other classifiers, the parameters that yielded highest accuracy for the algorithm differed between the two study areas. The use of a randomly selected subsample of training pixels was compared to the use of polygonal training areas, and we found that polygonal training data provided better classification accuracies in both cases."
Knowledge-Based Approaches to Accurate Mapping of Mangroves from Satellite Data,"Gao, Jay; Chen, Huifen; Zhang, Ying; Zha, Yong",pp. 1241-1248(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000011/art00002;jsessionid=apgbsjg31j3ci.x-ic-live-01,"Mangroves are difficult to map accurately from satellite data by means of parametric classification because of their spectral similarity to other coastal vegetation despite their habitat being inside coastal waters. This study aims to improve the mapping accuracy through incorporation of such spatial knowledge about mangroves in the Waitemata Harbor of Auckland, New Zealand, from SPOT data. The spatial knowledge was combined with spectral knowledge in the mapping. Supervised classification was found to map stunted and lush mangroves at an accuracy of, respectively, 46.7 percent and 68.3 percent. These accuracy levels rose, respectively, to 83.3 percent and 96.7 percent after the spatial knowledge was sequentially incorporated into the mapping. A similar accuracy level was achieved from knowledge-based spatial reasoning. If integrated simultaneously with spectral knowledge, spatial knowledge did not improve the accuracy noticeably because of difficulty in gaining quality spectral knowledge. It is concluded that knowledge-based, post-classification processing considerably improves the accuracy of mapping mangroves over parametric classification."

Monitoring this development is an emerging need, and a low-cost method would benefit emergency managers. Existing change-detection methods can be expensive and time consuming when applied to low-density urban change in large, vegetated areas. Nighttime satellite imagery is explored as means for addressing this problem, and a case study is presented for Colorado. The results indicate that from 1992–2000, Grand County had the greatest absolute increase in ambient sprawl into fire-prone areas (215 km2), but Teller County had the greatest percentage increase (7.3 percent). In 2000, La Plata County had the most ambient development in fire-prone areas (909 km2), but Jefferson County had the greatest percentage (42 percent). The paper concludes with a discussion of the prospects and problems of the approach."
"Integrating JERS-1 Imaging Radar and Elevation Models for Mapping Tropical Vegetation Communities in Far North Queensland, Australia","Ticehurst, Catherine; Held, Alex; Phinn, Stuart",pp. 1259-1266(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000011/art00004;jsessionid=apgbsjg31j3ci.x-ic-live-01,"The “Wet Tropics World Heritage Area” in Far North Queens-land, Australia consists predominantly of tropical rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest in areas of variable relief. Previous maps of vegetation communities in the area were produced by a labor-intensive combination of field survey and air-photo interpretation. Thus, the aim of this work was to develop a new vegetation mapping method based on imaging radar that incorporates topographical corrections, which could be repeated frequently, and which would reduce the need for detailed field assessments and associated costs. The method employed a topographic correction and mapping procedure that was developed to enable vegetation structural classes to be mapped from satellite imaging radar. Eight JERS-1 scenes covering the Wet Tropics area for 1996 were acquired from NASDA under the auspices of the “Global Rainforest Mapping Project.” JERS scenes were geometrically corrected for topographic distortion using an 80 m DEM and a combination of polynomial warping and radar viewing geometry modeling. An image mosaic was created to cover the Wet Tropics region, and a new technique for image smoothing was applied to the JERS texture bands and DEM before a Maximum Likelihood classification was applied to identify major land-cover and vegetation communities. Despite these efforts, dominant vegetation community classes could only be classified to low levels of accuracy (57.5 percent) which were partly explained by the significantly larger pixel size of the DEM in comparison to the JERS image (12.5 m). In addition, the spatial and floristic detail contained in the classes of the original validation maps were much finer than the JERS classification product was able to distinguish. In comparison to field and aerial photo-based approaches for mapping the vegetation of the Wet Tropics, appropriately corrected SAR data provides a more regional scale, all-weather mapping technique for broader vegetation classes. Further work is required to establish an appropriate combination of imaging radar with elevation data and other environmental surrogates to accurately map vegetation communities across the entire Wet Tropics."
Filtering Airborne Laser Scanner Data,"Vu, T.

This problem has been investigated so far with varieties of algorithms, but they suffer from different magnitudes of drawbacks. This study proposed a new and improved hybrid method based on multi-resolution analysis. Wavelet was adopted in this multi-resolution clustering approach. It enabled the classification of objects based on their size and the efficiency to filter out unwanted information at a specific resolution, and the proposed algorithm is named theALSwave(Airborne Laser Scanner Wavelet) method.ALSwavehas been tested on two data sets acquired over the urban areas of Tokyo, Japan and Stuttgart, Germany. The results showed a well-filtered, bare earth surface coupled with acceptable computational time. The accuracy assessment was carried out by comparison between the filtered bare earth surface byALSwaveand the manually filtered surface. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) follows a linear relationship with respect to terrain slope. This wavelet-based approach has opened a new way to filter the raw laser data that subsequently generates fast and more accurate digital terrain models."
Evaluation of Impervious Surface Estimates in a Rapidly Urbanizing Watershed,"Dougherty, Mark; Dymond, Randel L.; Goetz, Scott J.; Jantz, Claire A.; Goulet, Normand",pp. 1275-1284(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000011/art00006;jsessionid=apgbsjg31j3ci.x-ic-live-01,"Accurate measurement of impervious surface (IS) cover is an essential indicator of downstream water quality and a critical input variable for many water quality and quantity models. This study compares IS estimates from a recently developed satellite imagery/land cover approach with a more traditional aerial photography/land use approach. Both approaches are evaluated against a high-quality validation set consisting of planimetric data merged with manually-delineated areas of soil disturbance. The study area is the rapidly urbanizing 127 km2Cub Run watershed in northern Virginia, located on the fringe of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan region. Results show that photo-interpreted IS estimates of land class are higher than satellite-derived IS estimates by 100 percent or more, even in land uses conservatively assigned high IS values. Satellite-derived IS estimates by land class correlate well with planimetric reference data (r[Needspace]0.95) and with published ranges for similar sites in the region. Basin-wide mean IS values, difference grids, and regression and density plots validate the use of satellite-derived/land cover-based IS estimates over photo-interpreted/land use-based estimates. Results of this site-specific study support the use of automated, satellite-derived IS estimates for planning and management within rapidly urbanizing watersheds where a GIS system is in place, but where time-sensitive, high quality planimetric data is unavailable."
Snail Density Prediction for Schistosomiasis Control Using Ikonos and ASTER Images,"Xu, Bing; Gong, Peng; Biging, Greg; Liang, Song; Seto, Edmond; Spear, Robert",pp. 1285-1294(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000011/art00007;jsessionid=apgbsjg31j3ci.x-ic-live-01,"Schistosomiasis is a water-borne parasitic disease endemic in tropical and subtropical areas. Its transmission depends upon the presence of snails, which serve as intermediate hosts for the parasite. Some efforts have been made to classify snail habitats with remotely sensed data, but not to estimate snail abundance that is an important parameter in schistosomiasis transmission modeling. In this research, snail density was predicted by integrating the field survey and satellite images of different spatial resolution. A mountainous environment near Xichang city, in southwest Sichuan province, China, was chosen as the test site. Land-cover and land-use information extracted from 4 m resolution Ikonos data and elevation data derived from ASTER (Advanced Space-borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) data were used as reference for scaling up to greater spatial extents. Therefore, we estimated land-cover and land-use fraction data at the 30 m resolution level based on classification results from the Ikonos data. Snail abundance for each 30 m resolution grid was then predicted by regressing field survey data with land-cover and land-use fractions. Subsequently, a snail density map was generated using the territory of each of the over 200 residential groups as a mapping unit. An R2of 0.87 was obtained between the average snail density predicted and that surveyed for 19 groups. With such a model, we were able to extrapolate scattered snail abundance surveyed at a limited number of sites to the entire area. Spatial autocorrelation of snail distribution was considered as one of the possible factors in predicting snail density and tested for further model calibration."
A Modeling Approach for Estimating Watershed Impervious Surface Area from National Land Cover Data 92,"Jennings, David B.; Jarnagin, S.

Sample areas for the study were thirty-six subwatersheds ranging in size from 2 km2to 150 km2. A three-category rural-to-urban gradient design was utilized due to the changing sub-pixel relationship of impervious surface areas within developed/non-developed areas. A gradient rule based on the NLCD 92 DEVELOPED%defined the sample areas as “rural” (<18 percent ‘developed’), “intermediate” (18 percent–40 percent ‘developed’) and “dense suburban” (40.01 percent–80 percent ‘developed’). The gradient scheme produced three separate sets of coefficients per NLCD 92 Level 1 and Level 2 class. Results show distinct per-class coefficient groupings across the rural-to-urban gradient with coefficients directly related to the increasing level of development in a subwatershed. We also developed a linear equation between the NLCD 92 DEVELOPED%and truth percent impervious area. Results show a relative accuracy of approximately 80 percent and a mean absolute TIA%estimate error of approximately 2.0 percent±1.0 percent for both the Level 1 coefficients and the Level 2 coefficients. Results derived from the linear regression model show a relative accuracy of 70 percent with a mean absolute TIA%estimate error of approximately 2.0 percent±1.0 percent. This suggests that a linear model can be used as a rapid assessment tool to approximate TIA%from NLCD 92 data. Results are based on a spatial aggregation of pixels to the subwatershed or “whole-area” scale and are most applicable to “pour-point” models utilizing a single percent impervious surface area parameter. The models reported here have been tested only in the Mid-Atlantic region (USEPA Federal Region 3)."
A Quantitative Measure for the Quality of INSAR Interferograms Based on Phase Differences,"Li, Zhilin; Zou, Weibao; Ding, Xiaoli; Chen, Yongqi; Liu, Guoxiang",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000010/art00001;jsessionid=2rlemgds0bg3e.x-ic-live-03,"It is well-known that interferometric SAR (INSAR) is a technology for the generation of high-precision digital elevation models (DEM) and the precise measurement of terrain surface deformation. The accuracy of DEM and deformation measurement is highly dependent on the quality of the interferogram generated. Such an interferogram is constructed by a point-wise complex multiplication of corresponding pixels in both datasets, which are respectively contained in master image and registered image.An exanimation of existing literature reveals that there is no, good, quantitative measure for the quality of interfero-grams, and visual inspection is still the best solutions available so far. By visual inspection, one recognizes those interfer-ograms with continuous fringes as good ones and regards those with many discontinuous interferograms and speckles as being not good. As the pixels in the interferogram represent the phase value values, it is natural to think that, if the quality is good, the phase differences between neighbor pixels should be small, and thus the sum of all phase differences will still be small. This leads to the proposal of “sum of phase differences” (SPD) as a quantitative measure for the quality of interferogram. Two simulation tests have been conducted, and the results show that the SPD is a reliable measure."

In 2000, a field survey of the core area was completed with GPS and total station surveys. However, traditional mapping methods are no longer the most efficient means of obtaining topographic maps or DEM in large areas, especially those areas that are more inaccessible. Synthetic aperture radar interferometry has been proposed as a potential technique for digital elevation model (DEM) generation, topographic mapping, and surface motion detection. This paper presents an experimental investigation of the ERS-1/2 SAR tandem data on DEM generation of the Grove Mountains Core Area, and compares the DEM derived by INSAR with the DEM generated using field survey data. The paper confirms that INSAR is a very valuable technique to be utilized in Antarctica, and that INSAR can be employed to produce complementary field survey products."

This study finds that the temporal decorrelation is an important problem in the heavily vegetated rugged areas as usually expected, and that the atmospheric effects can be very significant at times.

It can be seen from the results that both of the areas are still settling significantly many years after the reclamation."

It is concluded that SAR interferometry may provide valuable information for understanding the spatial patterns and progress of natural hazards. SAR interferometry is also critical for mechanism studies and hazard mitigation.
Landslide Monitoring in the Three Gorges Area Using D-INSAR and Corner Reflectors,"Ye, Xia; Kaufmann, H.; Guo, X.F.",pp. 1167-1172(6),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000010/art00006;jsessionid=2rlemgds0bg3e.x-ic-live-03,"The differential INSAR technique has the potential for monitoring centimeter-scale ground motion in an accurate and cost-effective manner. Probably the most important limiting factor in the application of INSAR is temporal change in the complex reflectivity of the ground surface during the period between radar acquisitions. This can be due to changes in such parameters as moisture content or vegetation. The stable artificial corner reflectors can be identified from long temporal series of interferometric SAR images even with large baselines, and therefore decrease the risk of image decorrelation. This paper will discuss the following questions: 1) how to obtain the true phase of a corner reflector in a SAR complex image; 2) how to co-register the corner reflector pixels when the coherence of its surrounding area is extremely low; 3) how to select the interpolation kernel to resample the SAR image; and, 4) how to compute the interferometric phase of two co-registered corner reflectors without flat earth term and corners’ height contribution. In order to demonstrate the results, a practical example of landslide monitoring in the Three Gorges area in China is presented."
GPS and GIS Assisted Radar Interferometry,"Ge, Linlin; Li, Xiaojing; Rizos, Chris; Omura, Makoto",pp. 1173-1177(5),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000010/art00007;jsessionid=2rlemgds0bg3e.x-ic-live-03,"Error in radar satellite orbit determination is a common problem in radar interferometry (INSAR). For example, when we try to locate a radar test site with known geographic coordinates using the geocoding information in SLC (the latitude and longitude of the four image corners), the location is well away from the true position. Another example is when there is a signifi-cant disturbance in the differential INSAR result, we sometimes are not sure whether it is from ground deformation or atmospheric heterogeneity. Even after these are corrected, we need to export the INSAR results to a GIS format so that they can be overlaid as layers over orthophotos and mine plans (in the case of mining subsidence) in order to interpret the results. Therefore, it is proposed to use both GPS and GIS to assist radar interferometry. Results are presented with an application to monitoring subsidence due to underground mining southwest of Sydney, Australia."
Detection of Rapid Erosion in SE Spain,"Liu, Jian Guo; Mason, Philippa; Hilton, Fiona; Lee, Hoonyol",pp. 1179-1185(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000010/art00008;jsessionid=2rlemgds0bg3e.x-ic-live-03,"This paper presents an integrated remote sensing—GIS approach for identifying areas vulnerable to rapid erosion in Almería Province, Southeast Spain. Earth Resources Satellite (ERS) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) multi-temporal interferometric coherence imagery has been used to detect rapid erosion that causes random changes in the micro-topography of a land surface. These small scale changes result in reduced coherence of the radar signals between the initial and eroded states. However, the detection solely based on coherence imagery is not exclusive because other factors may cause losing coherence as well. A Geographic Information System (GIS) is then used to derive criteria for a set of environmental conditions favourable to rapid erosion from multi-datasets including Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) imagery and geological maps. The areas predicted to be most vulnerable to rapid erosion across the imagery are then identified where hard evidence of low coherence coincides with favourable conditions."
Satellite Navigation Parameter-Assisted Orthorectification for over 60°N Latitude Satellite Imagery,"Zhou, Guoqing; Jezek, K.",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000009/art00001;jsessionid=2lldqa3pjex6f.x-ic-live-02,"This paper presents a satellite navigation parameters-assisted orthorectification method for the generation of a seamless, full-coverage mosaic of the Greenland ice sheet using the over 60°N latitude Declassified Intelligence Satellite Photography (DISP) imagery. The model integrates the photogrammetric bundle adjustment model and satellite navigation parameters, which are expressed by a third order polynomial solving for the exterior orientation parameters of all images and satellite navigation parameters simultaneously. This is because of the fact that not each of DISP image contains sufficient Ground Control Points (GCPs), and it is almost impossible to find out or lay out the photogrammetrically targeted points prior to 1960s in the area of above 60°N latitude. The comparison of three orthorectification methods (camera model, second order polynomial, and the proposed method) demonstrated that the proposed method could reach highest accuracy of the other two methods. Finally, two full-coverage mosaics of Greenland using 24 DISP images from the ARGON 9034A Mission and 36 images from of the 9058A/59A mission were assembled. The average horizontal accuracy (relative to the SAR Mosaic) is estimated to be 168 m in flat area, and 183 m in mountainous area. The two mosaic products have been distributed for use of research community via CD and internet through the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) at no charge."

However, positional errors and geometric distortions may exist in the topographic contour maps and their derived DEMs due to inaccurate ground control and poor navigation techniques in the early years. In this paper, we present a new technique to detect and correct positional errors and geometric distortions in topographic data based on rigorous Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image simulation and mathematical modeling of SAR imaging geometry. Our method has been successfully applied to two USGS topographical data sets in Antarctica. Using Radarsat SAR imagery, positional errors of these two data sets have been reduced from 5 km to 200 m and from 200 m to 50 m, respectively."

Land cover data are derived from USGS Landsat (Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper +) images of Central Puget Sound. Landsat data were registered, intercalibrated, and corrected for atmosphere and topography to ensure accuracy of land cover change assessment. We apply a hybrid classification method to each image to address the spectral heterogeneity of urbanizing regions. The method combines a supervised classification approach with a spectral unmixing approach to produce seven classes: >75 percent impervious, 15 to 75 percent impervious, forest, grass, clear cut, bare soil, and water. Land cover change is identified using the direct spatial comparison of classified images derived independently for each time period. We assess that the overall accuracy of each classified image was 91 percent for 1991 and 88 percent for 1999 respectively, which produces an accuracy of 85 percent for the change analysis. Our results show that urban growth over the last decade has produced an overall 6.7 percent increase in paved area."
Spectral Mixture Analysis of the Urban Landscape in Indianapolis with Landsat ETM+ Imagery,"Lu, Dengsheng; Weng, Qihao",pp. 1053-1062(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000009/art00004;jsessionid=2lldqa3pjex6f.x-ic-live-02,"This paper examines characteristics of urban land-use and land-cover (LULC) classes using spectral mixture analysis (SMA), and develops a conceptual model for characterizing urban LULC patterns. A Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image of Indianapolis City was used in this research and a minimum noise fraction (MNF) transform was employed to convert the ETM+ image into principal components. Five image endmembers (shade, green vegetation, impervious surface, dry soil, and dark soil) were selected, and an unconstrained least-squares solution was used to un-mix the MNF components into fraction images. Different combinations of three or four endmembers were evaluated. The best fraction images were chosen to classify LULC classes based on a hybrid procedure that combined maximum-likelihood and decision-tree algorithms. The results indicate that the SMAbased approach significantly improved classification accuracy as compared to the maximum-likelihood classifier. The fraction images were found to be effective for characterizing the urban landscape patterns."

Besides applying commonly used clustering and supervised maximum-likelihood methods, we have developed a new classifier, nearest edge thresholding, which is unsupervised and based on the principals of edge detection and density slicing. Comparison of the three methods’ abilities to predict field values at plot scales of 100 m2to 900 m2shows this new method is better or comparable to others at all scales, can be easily applied to digital imagery, and has high correspondence with ground-truthed field values of tree cover."

Information about the snow extent in these regions is important for climate studies and water resource management. A linear spectral mixture model for snow-covered forests (the SnowFor model) has previously been developed for flat terrain. The SnowFor model includes reflectance components for snow, trees and snow-free ground. In this paper, the model is extended to handle radiometric effects caused by topography on mixed pixels of snow and trees through subpixel topographic reflectance modeling. Empirical reflectance models for snow and trees, based on the local solar incidence angle, are proposed (TopoSnow and TopoTree models), and integrated into the SnowFor model. Experiments with two Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images are carried out in hilly, forested terrain in Alptal, Switzerland with full snow cover. Results show that the calibrated TopoSnow and TopoTree models enhance the modeling of reflectance variability from snow-covered forests for visible and near-infrared wavelengths. The performance of four other topographic correction methods is evaluated for snow-covered forests."

A supervised classification used backscatter and sediment data to classify the area into zones of rock, gravelly-muddy sand, muddy sand, and mud. The derivative facies map was used to develop rules on a more sophisticated hierarchical decision-tree classification. The classification used four images, the acoustic-backscatter image, together with three variance images derived from the bathymetry and backscatter data. The classification predicted the distribution of seafloor facies of rock, gravelly-muddy sand, muddy sand, and mud. An accuracy assessment based on sediment samples shows the predicted seafloor facies map is 72 percent accurate."

Quasi-coincidence and quasi-difference, which are used to distinguish the topological relations between fuzzy objects, and to indicate the effect of one fuzzy object on another in a fuzzy topology adopted for the development. Geometrically, features in GIS can be classified as point features, linear features, and polygon or region features. In this paper, we first introduce several basic concepts in fuzzy topology that will be used in this study. This is followed by several definitions of fuzzy points, fuzzy lines, and fuzzy regions for GIS objects. Next, the level at which one fuzzy object affects the other is modeled based on the sum and difference of the membership functions that are quasi-coincident and quasi-different, respectively. Finally, an applicable example of using quasi-coincidence and quasidifference based on the new definitions of fuzzy point, line and polygon is given."

It was applied to UK land cover datasets from 1990 and 2000 in order to identify land cover change. The approach combined expression of expert opinion about how the semantics of the two datasets relate with spectral homogeneity metadata. A sample of the changes identified was assessed by field validation. Change was identified in 41 percent of the visited parcels, and all of the false positives were found to be due to classification error in either dataset. Thus, the approach reliably identifies inconsistency between two datasets, and the results indicate the suitability of uncertainty formalisms. The inclusion of extensive objectlevel metadata by the data producers greatly facilitates practical solutions to problems of data interoperability."

Error propagation in block adjustment of such images, and hence the final mapping accuracy, depends on multiple factors such as image collection geometry, image collection mode (mono or stereo), and distribution of ground control. This paper discusses the influence of these factors and presents a simplified method for accuracy pre-analysis of block adjustment of high-resolution satellite images. The proposed accuracy pre-analysis methodology is demonstrated using simulated monoscopic and stereo Ikonos image blocks, and the introduction of a cross strip is presented to demonstrate its effect on improving the accuracy of monoscopic blocks. The predictions of the pre-analysis model are validated using two real-world Ikonos mapping blocks."

While derived from grid DEM, the parameters often display noticeable errors due to errors (a) in data, (b) inherent in data structure, and (c) created by algorithms. It has been observed that some controversial results were reported in evaluating the results by various slope and aspect algorithms, largely because of the variety in assessment methodology and the difficulties in separating errors in data and those generated by the algorithms. This paper reports the study that assesses and compares the results from numerous grid-based slope and aspect algorithms using an analytical approach. Tests were made based on artificial polynomial surfaces which can be defined by mathematical formulae, with controllable “added” data errors. By this approach, different algorithms were quantitatively tested and their error components were analyzed. Thus, their suitability and tolerance related to DEM data characteristics can be described."

In this paper, we present a hybrid classifier approach using Decision Tree (DT) and ARTMAP1neural network to providing confidence or uncertainty information via majority voting and other rules. The hybrid classifier is tested with AVHRR data to mapping land cover of North America. The two classifiers (DT and ARTMAP) tend to make predictive errors in different contexts. They show 68% agreement in classifying land cover of North America. A set of rules is developed to assign class labels for pixels where the two classifiers disagree. Levels of confidence in the hybrid classification derived from their individual voting (ARTMAP) and probability (DT) are used to assign confidence. The approach outlined in this paper produces two products—a hybrid classification map as well as a confidence map based on the two classification schemes. The hybrid approach seems suitable to tackle a variety of classification problems in remote sensing and may ultimately aid map users in making more informed decisions."

Methodology for Hyperspectral Band Selection,"Bajcsy, Peter; Groves, Peter",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000007/art00001;jsessionid=raok1gk4mls1.x-ic-live-01,"While hyperspectral data are very rich in information, processing the hyperspectral data poses several challenges regarding computational requirements, information redundancy removal, relevant information identification, and modeling accuracy. In this paper we present a new methodology for combining unsupervised and supervised methods under classification accuracy and computational requirement constraints that is designed to perform hyperspectral band (wavelength range) selection and statistical modeling method selection. The band and method selections are utilized for prediction of continuous ground variables using airborne hyperspectral measurements. The novelty of the proposed work is in combining strengths of unsupervised and supervised band selection methods to build a computationally efficient and accurate band selection system. The unsupervised methods are used to rank hyperspectral bands while the accuracy of the predictions of supervised methods are used to score those rankings. We conducted experiments with seven unsupervised and three supervised methods. The list of unsupervised methods includes information entropy, first and second spectral derivative, spatial contrast, spectral ratio, correlation, and principal component analysis ranking combined with regression, regression tree, and instance-based supervised methods. These methods were applied to a data set that relates ground measurements of soil electrical conductivity with airborne hyperspectral image values. The outcomes of our analysis led to a conclusion that the optimum number of bands in this domain is the top four to eight bands obtained by the entropy unsupervised method followed by the regression tree supervised method evaluation. Although the proposed band selection approach is demonstrated with a data set from the precision agriculture domain, it applies in other hyperspectral application domains."

Results from this study suggest that a multi-band and multi-level wavelet approach can be used to drastically increase the classification accuracy. The fractal techniques did not provide satisfactory classification accuracy. Spatial autocorrelation and spatial co-occurrence techniques were found to be relatively effective when compared to the fractal approaches. It can be concluded that the wavelet transform approach is the most accurate of all four approaches."

We found that, for this location, AVIRIS holds modest, but real, advantages over Landsat for the classification of heterogeneous and vegetated land uses. Furthermore, this advantage comes almost entirely from the large number of sensor spectral bands rather than the high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)."

High spatial resolution airborne Digital Multispectral Videography (DMSV) data provided subpixel information for Landsat TM data. The SPLIT model employed a Modularized Artificial Neural Network (MANN) to integrate multi-sensor remote sensing data and to extract proportions of impervious surfaces and other types of land cover within TM pixels. Through a control unit, the MANN was able to decompose a complex task into multiple subtasks by using a group of sub-networks. The SPLIT model identified spectral relations between TM pixel values and the corresponding DMSV subpixel patterns. The established relationship allows extrapolation of the SPLIT model to the areas beyond DMSV data coverage. We applied five intervals, i.e., <20 percent, 21 to 40 percent, 41 to 60 percent, 61 to 80 percent, and >81 percent, to map the subpixel proportions of land cover types. We extrapolated the SPLIT model from training sites that have both TM and DMSV coverage into the entire DuPage County with TM data as the input. The extrapolation received 82.9 percent overall accuracy for the extracted proportions of urban impervious surface."

The objectives of this multi-layer, multi-source database are two fold: first, to provide consistent land cover for all 50 States, and second, to provide a data framework which allows flexibility in developing and applying each independent data component to a wide variety of other applications. Components in the database include the following: (1) normalized imagery for three time periods per path/row, (2) ancillary data, including a 30 m Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derived into slope, aspect and slope position, (3) perpixel estimates of percent imperviousness and percent tree canopy, (4) 29 classes of land cover data derived from the imagery, ancillary data, and derivatives, (5) classification rules, confidence estimates, and metadata from the land cover classification. This database is now being developed using a Mapping Zone approach, with 66 Zones in the continental United States and 23 Zones in Alaska. Results from three initial mapping Zones show single-pixel land cover accuracies ranging from 73 to 77 percent, imperviousness accuracies ranging from 83 to 91 percent, tree canopy accuracies ranging from 78 to 93 percent, and an estimated 50 percent increase in mapping efficiency over previous methods.

The LR and NN techniques were applied to two study sites with varied topography. We evaluated the performance of both methods in predicting burned scars based on predictive accuracy, uncertainty index, and computation time. The experimental results indicate that (1) the LR is more efficient than the NN in predicting burned scars, but both techniques can produce similar and acceptable prediction accuracy (overall average accuracy greater than 97 percent for both methods at the two study sites) of p/a of burned areas; (2) among all six original TM bands and five vegetation indices, original TM4 and TM7 and NDVI1 (TM4, TM7) and NDVI2 (TM4, TM3) exhibit the highest discrimination between burned scars and unburned vegetation areas; and (3) the predictive accuracy produced with samples from the shaded and shadowed areas is lower than that from the sunlit areas."

Accuracy of captured defects was determined while “standing,” “walking,” “cycling,” and “driving.” Errors ranged from 0.27 m to 12.49 m at the 95 percent confidence interval. A web-based questionnaire indicated that municipal geographic information users are unhappy with the quality of their data, and as yet, do not require data in real-time. Future research involves investigating alternative ways of capturing spoken commands, the effect that mobile computing has on the cognitive abilities of the user, and wireless connectivity required for real time access to spatial data."
Redefining the Paradigm of Modern Mobile Mapping,"Toth, Charles; Grejner-Brzezinska, Dorota",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000006/art00001;jsessionid=306mng3qs3m9d.x-ic-live-03,"A high-precision land-based integrated mapping system has been developed at The Ohio State University to support road centerline mapping operations at the Ohio Department of Transportation District 1 Office. The system represents a transition from the traditional mobile mapping paradigm towards a highly automated and autonomous design following the trends of modern geoinformatics. The two key components of the custom-designed system are a high-precision integrated GPS/INS navigation system and a fully digital and automated imaging subsystem. The van-based mapping system was designed to deliver the road centerline positions at subdecimeter accuracy in a highly automated manner with limited human interaction in near real time. The paper presents the system’s concept and design, followed by an individual performance evaluation of the navigation and imaging components; and finally road test results, representing an operational environment, are also reported."
DTM Generation from Ikonos In-Track Stereo Images Using a 3D Physical Model,"Toutin, Thierry",pp. 695-702(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000006/art00002;jsessionid=306mng3qs3m9d.x-ic-live-03,"A digital elevation model (DEM) extracted from Ikonos in-track stereo images using a 3D physical model developed at the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, Natural Resources Canada was evaluated. First, the stereo photogrammetric bundle adjustment was set up with about ten accurate ground control points. The DEM was then generated using an area-based multiscale image matching method and 3D semiautomatic editing tools and then compared to lidar elevation data with a 0.2-m accuracy. Because the DEM is, in fact, a digital terrain surface model where the height of land cover (trees, houses) is included, the accuracy varies depending on land-cover types. Using 3D visual classification of the stereo Ikonos images, different classes (forests, residential, bare soil, lakes) were generated to take into account the height of the surface (natural and human-made) in the accuracy evaluation. An elevation linear error with 68 percent confidence level (LE68) of 1.5 m was obtained for bare surfaces while an LE68 of 6.4 m was achieved over the full area. Five-meter contour lines could thus be derived, compliant with the highest topographic standard. Better results could thus be expected when using stereo-images acquired in the summertime. On the other hand, an LE68 of 2.5 m to 6.6 m was obtained depending on the land-cover type and its surface height. For residential areas, the surface height did not affect the errors very much (2.5-m LE68) when compared to bare surface results because one- and two-story houses were sparse in the test area. Because the images were unfortunately acquired in wintertime and the lidar data in summertime, elevation errors (LE68 and bias) also depended on the type of forest (deciduous, coniferous, mixed, sparse). An evaluation based on terrain slope and azimuth showed that the DEM error was linearly correlated with slope and that elevations on sun-facing slopes were 1-m more accurate than elevations on slopes facing away from the sun."
Mapping Coastal Vegetation Using an Expert System and Hyperspectral Imagery,"Schmidt, K.S.; Skidmore, A.K.; Kloosterman, E.H.; van Oosten, H.; Kumar, L.; Janssen, J.A.M.",pp. 703-715(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000006/art00003;jsessionid=306mng3qs3m9d.x-ic-live-03,"Mapping and monitoring saltmarshes in the Netherlands are important activities of the Ministry of Public Works (Rijkswaterstaat). The Survey Department (Meetkundige Dienst) produces vegetation maps using aerial photographs. However, it is a time-consuming and expensive activity. The accuracy of the conventional vegetation map derived using aerial photograph interpretation (API) is estimated to be around 43 percent. In this study, an alternative method is demonstrated that uses an expert system to combine airborne hyperspectral imagery with terrain data derived from radar altimetry. The accuracy of the vegetation map generated by the expert system increased to 66 percent. When hyperspectral imagery alone was used to classify coastal wetlands, an accuracy of 40 percent was achieved—comparable to the accuracy of the API-derived vegetation map. An analysis of the efficiency of the proposed expert system showed that the speed of map production is increased by using the new method. This means that digital image classification using the expert system is an objective and repeatable method superior to the conventional API method."
Using Remote Sensing to Assess Stand Loss and Defoliation in Maize,"Erickson, Bruce J.; Johannsen, Chris J.; Vorst, James J.; Biehl, Larry L.",pp. 717-722(6),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000006/art00004;jsessionid=306mng3qs3m9d.x-ic-live-03,"Assessing hail and wind damage to crops is a difficult, labor-intensive task. A quick and accurate method of determining losses could lead to better crop management decisions, more accurate insurance claim adjustment, and reduced expenses for the crop hail insurance industry. Radiometric data were collected in 1997, 1998, and 1999 in Indiana and Nebraska from field plots of maize, Zea mays L.,subjected to varying levels of damage. Incremental differences in plant damage resulted in incremental differences in spectral responses. The red and near-infrared spectral bands provided the most discrimination among levels of damage. Classification of remotely sensed images by damage level was performed by extrapolating spectral information from areas where damage levels were known to adjacent unknown areas of damage. Depending on location, sensor, and date of data collection, it was possible to classify the degree of early-season stand loss at accuracies of 48 to 100 percent. For leaf loss during the late vegetative stages, it was possible to classify the degree of leaf loss at accuracies of 81 to 100 percent and, for leaf loss during the early reproductive stages, it was possible to classify damage at accuracies of 71 to 98 percent. These results indicate that remote sensing could be used to improve the accuracy of estimating crop damage as long as adequate ground reference for different levels of crop damage exists."
Comparison of Land-Cover Classification Methods in the Brazilian Amazon Basin,"Lu, Dengsheng; Mausel, Paul; Batistella, Mateus; Moran, Emilio",pp. 723-731(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000006/art00005;jsessionid=306mng3qs3m9d.x-ic-live-03,"Four distinctly different classifiers were used to analyze multi-spectral data. Which of these classifiers is most suitable for a specific study area is not always clear. This paper provides a comparison of minimum-distance classifier (MDC), maximum-likelihood classifier (MLC), extraction and classification of homogeneous objects (ECHO), and decision-tree classifier based on linear spectral mixture analysis (DTC-LSMA). Each of the classifiers used both Landsat Thematic Mapper data and identical field-based training sample datasets in a western Brazilian Amazon study area. Seven land-cover classes—mature forest, advanced secondary succession, initial secondary succession, pasture lands, agricultural lands, bare lands, and water—were classified. Classification results indicate that the DTC-LSMA and ECHO classifiers were more accurate than were the MDC and MLC. The overall accuracy of the DTC-LSMA approach was 86 percent with a 0.82 kappa coefficient and ECHO had an accuracy of 83 percent with a 0.79 kappa coefficient. The accuracy of the other classifiers ranged from 77 to 80 percent with kappa coefficients from 0.72 to 0.75."
CoLaPS,"Guindon, Bert; Zhang, Ying",pp. 733-741(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000006/art00006;jsessionid=306mng3qs3m9d.x-ic-live-03,"A system, CoLaPS (Composite Land Processing System), is described for the production and analysis of land-cover information derived from Landsat satellite images. A key aspect of the design is the seamless linkage between its production and user subsystems. This element is based upon a number of postulates. First, for more efficient and diverse usage of remote sensing land-cover products, users require access to a broader range of datasets and functionality, many of which traditionally have resided in the production arena. Availability of these can result in improved (1) visual interpretation, (2) product enhancement by harnessing user expertise and regional ancillary information, and (3) higher level landscape characterizations. A key challenge facing land-cover producers is the need for detailed accuracy characterization of their products. CoLaPS utilizes classification consistency as an accuracy surrogate, leading to measures of classification confidence at the pixel level. This greatly enhances a user’s ability to detect, for example, real thematic change between multitemporal land-cover products."
A Critical Evaluation of the Normalized Error Matrix in Map Accuracy Assessment,"Stehman, Stephen V.",pp. 743-751(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000006/art00007;jsessionid=306mng3qs3m9d.x-ic-live-03,"Normalizing an error matrix is a commonly recommended analysis of map accuracy data. Theoretical and empirical results demonstrate that the traditional practice of normalizing an error matrix to uniform homogeneous marginal proportions produces biased and imprecise accuracy estimates, with the bias most prominent for user’s and producer’s accuracies. When used to compare maps, normalizing to uniform homogeneous marginal proportions evaluates an unrealistic hypothetical scenario in which all classes are assumed present in equal proportions for both the map and reference condition, and the map exactly reproduces the reference area proportions for each class. The marginal proportions of such normalized error matrices do not reflect realistic area distributions of either the map or true condition. For both descriptive and comparative objectives, the advantages typically claimed for normalizing error matrices are far outweighed by the estimation and interpretation difficulties created by this practice."
Potential for Calibrating Airborne Video Imagery Using Preflight Calibration Coefficients,"Edirisinghe, A.; Louis, J.P.; Chapman, G.E.",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000005/art00001;jsessionid=1m2kcdn2z1air.x-ic-live-02,"The low-cost Multispectral Airborne Video System (MAVS), developed using off-the-shelf components, is predominantly being used for agricultural and environmental monitoring applications in Australia. In order to guarantee quality of operational imagery, regular radiometric calibration checks, under both preflight and in-flight environments, are a necessity. While preflight calibration is conducted in the field with relative ease, to conduct in-flight calibration checks during operational missions is difficult, especially when onboard calibration instrumentation is not available. The calibration of MAVS imagery in flight requires a radiative transfer code such as the 6S to simulate the radiation signal at the operational altitude. A comparison of the simulated in-flight calibration equation with the corresponding preflight calibration equation showed a statistically significant agreement for every MAVS band, demonstrating the stability of response of the instrument in the air. This MAVS response stability indicates a potential for calibrating operational airborne imagery using preflight calibration equations. A few simulated in-flight calibration checks, in addition to regular preflight calibrations, could still be carried out during the flight season to verify system radiometric response in the air."
Assessment of Bidirectional Effects over Aquatic Macrophyte Vegetation in CIR Aerial Photographs,"Valta-Hulkkonen, Kirsi; Pellikka, Petri; Peltoniemi, Jouni",pp. 581-587(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000005/art00002;jsessionid=1m2kcdn2z1air.x-ic-live-02,"Radiometric effects hamper the use of airborne remote sensing data for quantitative studies of biophysical environments. The effect of bidirectional reflectance is evaluated in four areal samples from three lakes in the Vuoksi drainage basin in Finland. It is shown statistically that the relationship between measured upwelling radiation and the sun-target-sensor geometry is weak for an aquatic macrophyte species, the common reed(Phragmites australis),but strong for birch (Betula pubes-cens) and mixed birch-spruce(Picea abies)forest. The density and phenotype of the common reed vegetation seem to have an effect on the strength of the bidirectional reflectance in the images. When the effect of bidirectional reflectance over common reed vegetation is statistically significant, an empirical normalization method can be used, after which the brightness of the test areas is no longer statistically dependent on the sun-target-sensor geometry."
Seeing the Trees in the Forest,"Popescu, Sorin C.; Wynne, Randolph H.",pp. 589-604(16),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000005/art00003;jsessionid=1m2kcdn2z1air.x-ic-live-02,"The main study objective was to develop robust processing and analysis techniques to facilitate the use of small-footprint lidar data for estimating plot-level tree height by measuring individual trees identifiable on the three-dimensional lidar surface. Lidar processing techniques included data fusion with multispectral optical data and local filtering with both square and circular windows of variable size. The lidar system used for this study produced an average footprint of 0.65 m and an average distance between laser shots of 0.7 m. The lidar data set was acquired over deciduous and coniferous stands with settings typical of the southeastern United States. The lidar-derived tree measurements were used with regression models and cross-validation to estimate tree height on 0.017-ha plots. For the pine plots, lidar measurements explained 97 percent of the variance associated with the mean height of dominant trees. For deciduous plots, regression models explained 79 percent of the mean height variance for dominant trees. Filtering for local maximum with circular windows gave better fitting models for pines, while for deciduous trees, filtering with square windows provided a slightly better model fit. Using lidar and optical data fusion to differentiate between forest types provided better results for estimating average plot height for pines. Estimating tree height for deciduous plots gave superior results without calibrating the search window size based on forest type."
A Complete High-Resolution Coastline of Antarctica Extracted from Orthorectified Radarsat SAR Imagery,"Liu, Hongxing; Jezek, Kenneth C.",pp. 605-616(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000005/art00004;jsessionid=1m2kcdn2z1air.x-ic-live-02,"A complete, high-resolution coastline of Antarctica, extracted from an orthorectified mosaic of Radarsat-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images through a sequence of automated image processing algorithms, is presented. A locally adaptive thresholding method is used to segment the orthorectified SAR images, while image-object formation and labeling, and edge-tracing techniques are used to process the segmented images into vector-based cartographic products of coastline, defined here as the boundary between continental ice or rock exposures and sea ice covered ocean. The absolute accuracy of planimetric positioning of the resultant coastline is estimated to better than 130 m, and its spatial resolution (25 m) is adequate for supporting cartographic and scientific applications at 1:50,000 scale. This radar-image-derived coastline gives an accurate description of geometric shape and glaciological characteristics of the Antarctic coasts and also provides a precise benchmark for future change-detection studies."
An Integrated Approach for Landslide Susceptibility Mapping Using Remote Sensing and GIS,"Sarkar, S.; Kanungo, D.P.",pp. 617-625(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000005/art00005;jsessionid=1m2kcdn2z1air.x-ic-live-02,"A methodology for landslide susceptibility mapping using an integrated remote sensing and GIS approach is presented. A part of the Darjeeling Himalaya was selected for the model execution. IRS satellite data, topographic maps, field data, and other informative maps were used as inputs to the study. Important terrain factors, contributing to landslide occurrences in the region, were identified and corresponding thematic data layers were generated. These data layers represent the geological, topographical, and hydrological conditions of the terrain. A numerical rating scheme for the factors was developed for spatial data analysis in a GIS. The resulting landslide susceptibility map delineates the area into different zones of four relative susceptibility classes: high, moderate, low, and very low. The susceptibility map was validated by correlating the landslide frequencies of different classes. This has shown a close agreement with the existing field instability condition. The effectiveness of the map was also confirmed by the high statistically significant value of a chi-square test."

This comparison is typically achieved by a basic subjective assessment of the observed difference in accuracy but should be undertaken in a statistically rigorous fashion. One approach for the evaluation of the statistical significance of a difference in map accuracy that has been widely used in remote sensing research is based on the comparison of the kappa coefficient of agreement derived for each map. The conventional approach to the comparison of kappa coefficients assumes that the samples used in their calculation are independent, an assumption that is commonly unsatisfied because the same sample of ground data sites is often used for each map. Alternative methods to evaluate the statistical significance of differences in accuracy are available for both related and independent samples. Approaches for map comparison based on the kappa coefficient and proportion of correctly allocated cases, the two most widely used metrics of thematic map accuracy in remote sensing, are discussed. An example illustrates how classifications based on the same sample of ground data sites may be compared rigorously and highlights the importance of distinguishing between one- and two-sided statistical tests in the comparison of classification accuracy statements."

The experience of chaining this service with the Open GIS Consortium (OGC) Web Mapping Services is also summarized. In the process, the difficulties arising from the lack of standards in the areas of projection systems representation and georectified raster imagery encodings are highlighted. The limitations of legacy GIS systems in accommodating the requirements of a generic re-projection service are also discussed. Lessons learned about basic requirements for efficient service chaining are presented in the areas of performance and reliability of services, ease of access to services and their capabilities, and the need for simple solutions."
An Accurate and Automated Approach to Georectification of HDF-EOS Swath Data,"Yang, Wenli; Di, Liping",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000004/art00001;jsessionid=3sclipi3ijmef.x-ic-live-02,"HDF-EOS is the standard format for NASA’s EOS data products. Data stored in the HDF-EOS swath structure are in a raw sensor coordinate system and are not rectified to a map projection or geographic coordinate system. The geolocation information is stored as separate fields in a swath. Swath data have to be georectified before they can be integrated and analyzed. Presently, no general purpose remote sensing image processing or geographic information system software has the capability to directly perform georectification of HDF-EOS swath data by using the geolocation information in the file. Most software cannot even import such data due to the relevant newness of the format, and this has limited the public use of NASA EOS data products. This paper describes algorithms that automatically georectify the swath data by using the geolocation information in the swath. The algorithms have been implemented in a software package which is freely available to data users."
Assessing the Accuracy of National Land Cover Dataset Area Estimates at Multiple Spatial Extents,"Hollister, Jeffrey W.; Gonzalez, M.

Additionally, accuracy of landscape structure metrics calculated from area estimates cannot be determined solely from site-specific assessments. We used LULC data from Rhode Island and Massachusetts as reference to determine the accuracy of area measurements from the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) within spatial units ranging from 0.1 to 200 km2. When regressed on reference area, NLCD area of developed land, agriculture, forest, and water had positive linear relationships with high r2, suggesting acceptable accuracy. However, many of these classes also displayed mean differences (NLCD REFERENCE), and linear relationships between the NLCD and reference were not one-to-one (i.e., low r2, β0≠ 0, β1≠ 1), suggesting mapped area is different from true area. Rangeland, wetland, and barren were consistently, poorly classified."
Combining Non-Parametric Models for Multisource Predictive Forest Mapping,"Huang, Zhi; Lees, Brian G.",pp. 415-425(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000004/art00003;jsessionid=3sclipi3ijmef.x-ic-live-02,"Most models of forest type for predictive mapping cannot produce estimates of confidence in the prediction of individual pixels, even where they provide good overall accuracy. A new strategy that combines several models based on different principles not only provides estimates of prediction confidence, but also improves the mapping accuracy. In this study, the theoretical foundation of Artificial Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and Dempster-Shafer’s Evidence Theory are briefly reviewed, compared, and applied to a common data set. Two ways for integrating the results of the three models were then evaluated. One method was to separately harden the probability results of the three models, then combine them to make a single classification. In the second method, the probabilities of the three models for each pixel were simply averaged, then hardened to a single classification. Deferring the hardening to the final stage produced the best results. The 3 percent increase in overall accuracy for the second approach compared with the best individual model is encouraging. More importantly, estimates of prediction confidence were derived, based on a comparison between a combined model and the three models, something that is impossible using a single model."
An Initial Study on Automatic Reconstruction of Ground DEMs from Airborne IfSAR DSMs,"Zhang, Yun; Tao, C. Vincent; Mercer, J.

Many modern mapping technologies, such as lidar scanning, interferometric SAR (IfSAR), and stereo image matching, are capable of generating digital surface models (DSMs) directly. Research on deriving DEMs from DSMs is a topical area. Airborne IfSAR technology has been in commercial operation since 1996. However, it is still technically challenging to automate the process of generating DEMs from IfSAR DSMs. The lack of scientific studies in this area is mainly caused by the sensitivity and availability of commercial IfSAR data. In this study, researchers have been working with the commercial IfSAR system developer to perform an initial study on automatic reconstruction of ground DEMs from IfSAR DSMs. This paper presents a compact and yet efficient version of our developed approach. This approach has been tested by using many IfSAR DSMs in different hilly urban areas with light and moderate variations in relief. An accuracy analysis of the reconstructed ground DEMs against the laser DSMs and DEMs has also been performed to test the reliability and efficiency of our approach."
The Characteristics and Interpretability of Land Surface Change and Implications for Project Design,"Sohl, Terry L.; Gallant, Alisa L.; Loveland, Thomas R.",pp. 439-448(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000004/art00005;jsessionid=3sclipi3ijmef.x-ic-live-02,"The need for comprehensive, accurate information on land-cover change has never been greater. While remotely sensed imagery affords the opportunity to provide information on land-cover change over large geographic expanses at a relatively low cost, the characteristics of land-surface change bring into question the suitability of many commonly used methodologies. Algorithm-based methodologies to detect change generally cannot provide the same level of accuracy as the analyses done by human interpreters. Results from the Land Cover Trends project, a cooperative venture that includes the U.S. Geological Survey, Environmental Protection Agency, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration, have shown that land-cover conversion is a relatively rare event, occurs locally in small patches, varies geographically and temporally, and is spectrally ambiguous. Based on these characteristics of change and the type of information required, manual interpretation was selected as the primary means of detecting change in the Land Cover Trends project. Mixtures of algorithm-based detection and manual interpretation may often prove to be the most feasible and appropriate design for change-detection applications. Serious examination of the expected characteristics and measurability of change must be considered during the design and implementation phase of any change analysis project."
Validation and Calibration of Canada-Wide Coarse-Resolution Satellite Burned-Area Maps,"Fraser, R.H.; Hall, R.J.; Landry, R.; Lynham, T.; Raymond, D.; Lee, B.; Li, Z.",pp. 451-460(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000004/art00006;jsessionid=3sclipi3ijmef.x-ic-live-02,"Satellite-based mapping can provide a timely and efficient means of identifying burned vegetation at continental scales for estimating greenhouse gas emissions and impacts on the terrestrial carbon budget. In this study, we used a sample of 55 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes distributed across Canada to validate and calibrate 1998 and 1999 national-level burned areas maps produced using coarse resolution (approx. 1-km) SPOT VEGETATION and NOAA AVHRR imagery. Commission and omissions errors, based on fire events greater than 200 ha, were found to be small in the coarse resolution maps (4 percent and 1 percent, respectively). However, the coarse resolution burned-area estimates were 72 percent larger than the crown fire burned area mapped at 30 m using Landsat TM (11,039 versus 6,403 ha average area). This bias was attributed to spatial aggregation effects in which the coarse resolution product included the tree crown fire, partial burn, and unburned fractions of a pixel. A regression calibration model (R20.95, p < 0.0005, RMSE = 3,015 ha, n = 155) based on a VGT/TM double sampling approach was derived to correct for the aggregation bias and to provide Canada-wide estimates of crown fire burned area."

The estimates of OVG date were highly correlated with geographic patterns and climatic variations across time and space within our study area. The date of OVG was earliest for the forest and meadow steppe, later for the typical steppe, and latest for the desert steppe. Our findings also showed that ecosystems in the Mongolian Plateau exhibited high spa-tiotemporal variability in the date of OVG during the study period. The date of onset was found to be most consistent for the forest ecosystem, while the desert steppe was characterized by high year-to-year variations in onset date. A comparison of the derived OVG date estimates with meteorological data showed a clear linkage between onset date and the beginning of spring precipitation in the dry region of the Mongolian Plateau."
A Basis for Estimating Digital Camera Parameters,"Light, Don",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000003/art00001;jsessionid=epmkhs5tcenf6.x-ic-live-03,"Matching the diffraction-limited optical resolution with the appropriate detector size is a fundamental design requirement for digital imaging systems. A useful Design Function based on the Airy disk is λF/p = 0.82. Where λ is the average wavelength, F is the camera F-number, and p is the detector sampling pitch (pixel size). A second metric, attributed to Schade and reported by Holst (1999), produces an often used Design Function: λF/p = 1. Examples demonstrate the use of the Design Functions to determine basic parameters, F-number, focal length, aperture diameter, and pixel size for an imaging system. Pixel size is selected from commercially available arrays and the other parameters are estimated given the required ground sampled distance (GSD) with either of the two Design Functions. One of the primary uses for the Design Functions is to provide optical systems engineers with a simple, fast, and proven means of arriving at first-order estimates for electro-optical camera designs. It follows that estimating costs for building large space camera systems should be less complicated."

The software was then used to determine the local three-dimensional coordinates of roadside features using the sequential imagery from the mobile video-logging system captured along a highway at highway speed. The relative locations were transformed to the absolute locations using the locations of the camera’s exposure stations from the Global Positioning System. The relative accuracy of the locations obtained was 5 cm, and absolute accuracy using the code phase kinematic Global Positioning System was 2 m. This paper also shows the two-dimensional geographic information system, three-dimensional geographic information system, and virtual reality created for three test sites using the imagery from the mobile video-logging system."

Mapping Snowpack Depth beneath Forest Canopies Using Airborne Lidar,"Hopkinson, Chris; Sitar, Mike; Chasmer, Laura; Treitz, Paul",pp. 323-330(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000003/art00004;jsessionid=epmkhs5tcenf6.x-ic-live-03,"An evaluation of airborne lidar (Light Detection And Ranging) technology for snow depth mapping beneath different forest canopy covers (deciduous, coniferous, and mixed) is presented. Airborne lidar data were collected for a forested study site both prior to and during peak snowpack accumulation. Manual field measurements of snow depth were collected coincident with the peak snowpack lidar survey, and a comparison between field and lidar depth estimates was made. It was found that (1) snow depth distribution patterns can be mapped by subtracting a “bare-earth” DEM from a “peak snowpack” DEM, (2) snow depth estimates derived from lidar data are strongly related to manual field measures of snow depth, and (3) snow depth estimates are most accurate in areas of minimal understory. It has been demonstrated that airborne lidar data provide accurate snow depth data for the purpose of mapping spatial snowpack distribution for volume estimations, even under forest canopy conditions."
Accuracy of Airborne Lidar-Derived Elevation,"Hodgson, Michael E.; Bresnahan, Patrick",pp. 331-339(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000003/art00005;jsessionid=epmkhs5tcenf6.x-ic-live-03,"As part of a countywide large-scale mapping effort for Richland County, South Carolina, an accuracy assessment of a recently acquired lidar-derived data set was conducted. Airborne lidar (2-m nominal posting) was collected at a flying height of 1207 meters above ground level (AGL) using an Optech ALTM (Airborne Laser Terrain Mapper) 1210 system. Unique to this study are the reference point elevations. Rather than using an interpolation approach for gathering observed elevations at reference points, the x-y coordinates of lidar points were located in the field and these elevations were surveyed. Using both total-station-based and rapid-static GPS techniques, observed vertical heights were measured at each reference lidar posting. The variability of vertical accuracy was evaluated for six land-cover categories. Root-meansquared error (RMSE) values ranged from a low of 17 to 19 cm (pavement, low grass, and evergreen forests) to a high of 26 cm (deciduous forests). The unique error assessment of lidar postings also allowed for the creation of an error budget model. The observed lidar elevation error was decomposed into errors from lidar system measurements, horizontal displacement, interpolation error, and surveyor error. A crossvalidation approach was used to assess the observed interpolated lidar elevation error for each field-verified reference point. In order of decreasing importance, the lidar system measurements were the dominant source of error followed by interpolation error, horizontal displacement error, and surveyor error. Observed elevation error in steeper slopes (e.g., 25º) was estimated to be twice as large as those on low slopes (e.g., 1.5º)."
Automating the Analysis of Remotely Sensed Data,"Skelsey, Chris; Law, A.N.R.; Winter, Mark; Lishman, J.R.",pp. 341-350(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000003/art00006;jsessionid=epmkhs5tcenf6.x-ic-live-03,"Land cover is a complex phenomenon, its appearance and transition influenced by the soil, topography, climate, politics, ecology, and other aspects of land use. An operational study of land-cover change must consider such factors, and, if automation is to be employed, a new approach to software architecture and reasoning is required. The Macaulay Institute has developed the concept of task orientation as a means of supporting such work, and is currently investigating its utility in the update of the Land Cover of Scotland (1988) dataset. This paper describes the motivation behind the development of ETORA-II, an operational toolkit providing a task-orientated capability, and SYMOLAC-II, a proof-of-concept application. The final aim of this work is to produce an environmental information system for Scotland’s land cover."
Individual Tree-Crown Delineation and Treetop Detection in High-Spatial-Resolution Aerial Imagery,"Wang, Le; Gong, Peng; Biging, Gregory S.",pp. 351-357(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000003/art00007;jsessionid=epmkhs5tcenf6.x-ic-live-03,"The cost of forest sampling can be reduced substantially by the ability to estimate forest and tree parameters directly from aerial photographs. However, in order to do so it is necessary to be able to accurately identify individual treetops and then to define the region in the vicinity of the treetop that encompasses the crown extent. These two steps commonly have been treated independently.In this paper, we derive individual tree-crown boundaries and treetop locations under a unified framework. We applied a two-stage approach with edge detection followed by marker-controlled watershed segmentation. A Laplacian of Gaussian edge detection method at the smallest effective scale was employed to mask out the background. An eight-connectivity scheme was used to label the remaining tree objects in the edge map. Subsequently, treetops are modeled based on both radiometry and geometry. More specifically, treetops are assumed to be represented by local radiation maxima and also to be located near the center of the tree-crown. As a result, a marker image was created from the derived treetop to guide a watershed segmentation to further differentiate touching and clumping trees and to produce a segmented image comprised of individual tree crowns.Our methods were developed on a 256- by 256-pixel CASI image of a commercially thinned trial forest. A promising agreement between our automatic methods and manual delineation results was achieved in counting the number of trees as well as in delineating tree crowns."

Between 1994 and 1997 a medical survey in a rural area in central China revealed the highest incidence rate of the disease recorded in the world to date, with 15.8 percent of the population infected in one village. Hypotheses on the nature of the transmission mechanisms from the natural to human environment focused on the effects of recent landscape change from forest to agricultural land. Archived Landsat MSS and TM data were used to examine relationships between landscape and human AE prevalence in 31 villages. The results showed a significant positive correlation between AE and the proximity of villages to forest, grassland, and shrubland vegetation, and a negative correlation with the area of cultivated land. A predictive model, based on spatial characteristics of the landscape, is now being developed with the aim of designing management tools for disease control."
Some Requirements for Geographic Information Systems,"Heipke, Christian",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000002/art00001;jsessionid=8ji7kutsb0h9d.x-ic-live-02,"Some requirements which an ideal geographic information system (GIS) must meet to cope with the challenges of the future are described. We look at data modeling, the integration of geographic information science and photogrammetry, update and refinement of a geospatial database, and data integration. We claim that data modeling needs to be carried out in3D based on a topologic data structure with the possibility for incorporating change. Photogrammetric operations such as the generation of digital terrain models or the manual and automatic acquisition of vector data from imagery should be considered as modules of future GIS, which should also have efficient mechanisms for incremental updating and versioning. Finally, the integration of all types of data should be possible, e.g., various vector data sets as well as DTMs and images.We illustrate the requirements with the help of three examples, one describing data acquisition and modeling in an interdisciplinary project, one dealing with quality control and update using imagery, and the last one presenting an algorithm for the integration of a2D data set and a DTM.This paper discusses GIS from a photogrammetric point of view with an emphasis on imaging and data acquisition. While we believe that the discussed requirements are vital for the development of GIS, we are aware of the fact that other issues such as database design, software architecture, visualization, geospatial data infrastructure, and web mapping, only briefly mentioned or not discussed at all in this paper, are of similar importance for the field."

The advent of the first mobile mapping systems (MMS) in the early 1990s initiated the process of establishing modern, virtually ground-control-free photogrammetry and digital mapping. By the end of the last decade, mobile mapping technology had made remarkable progress, evolving from rather simple land-based systems to more sophisticated, real-time multitasking and multisensor systems, operational in land and airborne environments. New specialized systems, based on modern imaging sensors, such as CCD (charge-coupled device) cameras, lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) and hyperspectral/multispectral scanners, are being developed, aimed at automatic data acquisition for geoinformatics, thematic mapping, land classification, terrain modeling, emergency response, homeland security, etc. This paper provides an overview of the mobile mapping concept, with a special emphasis on the MMS paradigm shift from the post-mission to near-real-time systems that occurred in the past few years. A short review of the direct georeferencing concept is given, and the major techniques (sensors) used for platform georegistration, as well as the primary radiolocation techniques based on wireless networks, are presented. An overview of the major imaging sensors and the importance of multisensor system calibration are also provided. Future perspectives of mobile mapping and its extension towards telegeoinformatics are also discussed. Some examples of mobile geospatial technology used in automatic object recognition, real-time highway centerline mapping, thematic mapping, and city modeling with lidar and multispectral imagery are included."

The classification technique introduced within this work will also provide an opportunity for fully automated thematic and land-use map generation.

The integrated system consists of three main parts: expert, user, and map. Rules can be constructed easily in the expert part using English. Users can derive a solution to a specific problem from the rules in the user part through the interactive question-and-answer sequence. The solution can then be mapped directly in the GIS (map) part. This system is applied to the interactive interpretation and mapping of aerial photographs for an urban area.

This approach attempts to model both the structural and behavioral aspects of the development control process by integrated representation of agents, events, and states as well as their relations. These relations can be represented with UML (Unified Modeling Language), causal entity-relation diagram, and Event Pattern Language-based formal specifications.The integration of heterogeneous spatial and non-spatial data within such a GIS-based CSCW system for development control is also introduced in this paper. A method to link spatial objects and attributes in the multiscale, multitype dataset is proposed.

We introduce the Mars global and landing site local reference systems. For global rover localization in the Mars body-fixed reference system, a triangulation can be performed using observations of common landmarks on satellite images and the very first set of surface images. Alternatively, ultra-high frequency (UHF) two-way Doppler tracking technology can determine the location. For localization of the rover in the landing site area, onboard rover localization techniques will be performed in real time. A visual odometry experiment will improve localization by overcoming problems associated with wheel odometry such as slippage and low accuracy. Finally, a bundle-adjustmentbased rover localization method will build an image network acquired by Pancam, Navcam, and Hazcam cameras. The developed incremental and integrated bundle adjustment models will supply improved rover locations and image orientation parameters, which are critical for the generation of high quality landing site topographic mapping products. Based on field tests performed on Earth and Mars (MPF mission data), a relative localization accuracy of one percent of the traversing distance from the landing center is expected to be achieved during this mission. In addition, the bundle adjustment results will also enable us to produce high precision landing site topographic mapping products, including seamless panoramic image mosaics, DTMs, and orthophotos."
Landsat TM Satellite Image Restoration Using Kalman Filters,"Arbel, D.; Cohen, E.; Citroen, M.; Blumberg, D.G.; Kopeika, N.S.",pp. 91-100(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000001/art00002;jsessionid=30j75gad2d06r.x-ic-live-02,"The quality of satellite images propagating through the atmosphere is affected by phenomena such as scattering and absorption of light, and turbulence, which degrade the image by blurring it and reducing its contrast. The atmospheric Wiener filter, which corrects for turbulence blur, aerosol blur, and path radiance simultaneously, is implemented in the digital restoration of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery. Digital restoration results for Landsat TM imagery using the atmospheric Wiener filter were presented in the past. Here, a new approach for digital restoration of Landsat TM imagery is presented by implementing a Kalman filter as an atmospheric filter, which corrects for turbulence blur, aerosol blur, and path radiance simultaneously. Turbulence MTF is calculated from meteorological data. Aerosol MTF is consistent with optical depth. The product of the two yields atmospheric MTF, which is implemented in both the atmospheric Wiener and Kalman filters. Restoration improves both resolvable detail and contrast. Restorations are quite apparent even under clear weather conditions. Although aerosol MTF is dominant, slightly better results are obtained when the shape of atmospheric MTF includes turbulence, in addition to that of aerosol MTF, as shown by the use of criteria for restoration success. In general, the Kalman restoration is superior."

Long- and short-term changes in vegetation functioning are a key indicator of ecological processes. We predict net primary production (NPP) at monthly temporal resolution for 16 years (1981–1996) at an 8-km spatial resolution for the approximately 106km2area of Ontario, Canada. We calculate landscape-level light use efficiency values that are tuned to monthly and long-term ecoclimates, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index from the NOAA-AVHRR sensor. Applying our spatio-temporal analysis tools, we show evidence for increasing NPP across most of the province. This increase varies seasonally and annually across Ontario, and its magnitude and distribution varies with the spatial scales of analysis. Bridging the gap between local and global studies, this research supports spatio-temporal monitoring and analysis of ecosystem functions."
Automated Subpixel Photobathymetry and Water Quality Mapping,"Huguenin, Robert L.; Wang, Mo Hwa; Biehl, Robert; Stoodley, Scott; Rogers, Jeffrey N.",pp. 111-123(13),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2004/00000070/00000001/art00004;jsessionid=30j75gad2d06r.x-ic-live-02,"New photobathymetry and water quality software is described here that utilizes subpixel analysis software (Subpixel Classifier) with an autonomous image calibration procedure and analytic retrieval algorithm to simultaneously retrieve and report bottom depth and the concentrations of suspended chlorophyll, suspended sediments, and colored dissolved organic carbon on a per-pixel basis from four-band multispectral image data. From the derived composition, the QSC2 (Quantitative Shoreline Characterization, Version 2.0) software also computes and reports water column visibility parameters (vertical and horizontal subsurface sighting ranges and turbidity, each at four wavelength band passes, plus Secchi depth as a scalar) as well as depth and turbidity confidence. QSC2 compensates for the effects of the atmosphere, sun and sky reflections from the water surface, subpixel contributions from exposed land, and variations in the bottom material properties. All information is derived automatically from the pixel data alone. The performance of the QSC2 software was demonstrated using a four-band Ikonos image of Plymouth, Massachusetts. Accuracies of the image-derived compositions, water clarity, and depths were assessed using field and laboratory measurements for eight representative lakes in the scene. The means of the differences of the field-measured and image-derived suspended chlorophyll and colored dissolved organic carbon concentrations for the eight lakes were 1.82 μg/l and 4.34 mgC/l, respectively. The image-derived concentrations of suspended sediments were all below the threshold of detection for the field samples (5 mg/l), in agreement with the field data. The mean of the differences between field-measured and image-derived Secchi depths was 0.76 m. The mean depth difference was 0.57 m."

In advanced stages, the process of eutrophication can cause harmful algae blooms. This research retrieved the concentrations of suspended chlorophyll (Chl), suspended minerals (SM), colored dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and turbidity (total attenuation) from AVIRIS imagery of a severely overenriched waterway in North Carolina, and evaluated if these parameters could be used as indicators of conditions leading to algae blooms. A digital image processing algorithm called QSC1 (Quantitative Shoreline Characterization, Version 1.0) was used. The retrieved water quality parameter values were tested by statistical comparisons to field measurements made at the time of the AVIRIS data collection. Applying QSC1 to AVIRIS imagery resulted in measurements of Chl that correlated well with field measurements (r = 0.84). Problems with field sampling prevented the assessment of retrieved SM and DOC. The statistical correlation analysis indicated that, for comparison to remotely sensed data, field measurements in the steadily flowing Neuse River must be collected within two hours of the imagery. Thematic maps of each water quality parameter were generated from the imagery and evaluated. The maps of Chl showed spatial patterns consistent with the field data and circulation of the river, and indicated potential point and non-point sources. Statistical and principle component analyses were used to assess whether the AVIRIS water quality measurements were directly or indirectly related to parameters and conditions indicative of nutrient loading and algae blooms that were measured in the field. The AVIRIS measurements were used to create a new index of eutrophication, the Algae Production Potential Index (APPI), for the purpose of mapping where conditions of high nutrient loading and potential algae blooms exist. The index uses direct measurements of Chl, DOC, and SM (as a surrogate for phosphate). These measurements are combined in a GIS model based on ecological relationships. Although not field verified, the APPI map shows patterns of algae bloom conditions that are similar in size, scale, and location to previous blooms in the Neuse."

A study of the potential of these images for tree species in “monoculture stands” identification was conducted. Two Ikonos images were acquired, one in June 2000 and the other in October 2000, for an 11- by 11-km area covering the Sonian Forest in the southeastern part of the Brussels-Capital region (Belgium). The two images were orthorectified using a digital elevation model and 1256 geodetic control points.The identification of the tree species was carried out utilizing a supervised maximum-likelihood classification on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Classifications were performed on the orthorectified data, NDVI transformed data, and principal components imagery. In order to decrease the intraclass variance, a mean filter was applied to all the spectral bands and neo-channels used in the classification process. Training and validation areas were selected and digitized using detailed geographical databases of the tree species. The selection of the relevant bands and neo-channels was carried out by successive addition of information in order to improve the classification results. Seven different tree species of one to two different age classes were identified with an overall accuracy of 86 percent. The seven identified tree species or species groups are Oaks (Quercus sp.), Beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), Purple Beech (Fagus sylvatica purpurea), Douglas Fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Corsican Pine (Pinus nigra Arn. subsp. laricio (Poir.) Maire var. corsican), and Larch (Larix decidua Mill.)."

Analysis was performed on 4-m and 20-m spatial resolution imagery derived from Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) data, to simulate the difference in land-cover classification accuracy between multispectral Ikonos and Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre (SPOT) High Resolution Visible (HRV) imagery. Initially, per-pixel classification was performed, followed by perfield classification. The technique for detecting missing boundaries was then implemented, and per-field classification was carried out a second time using updated field boundary data. Finally, an accuracy assessment was performed. The results demonstrate that classification was significantly more accurate when the missing boundary flag was used, and that simulated Ikonos imagery was considerably more accurate for this purpose than simulated SPOT HRV imagery."

The Earth is separated into “row strips” aligned with the Landsat World Reference System (WRS), and the multi-scene coverage of Landsat imagery is divided into three types of areas: extended, missing, and overlap. Varying image orientation and narrowing row-strip width with increasing latitude are shown to have major impacts on these three areas. The dependencies of these coverage areas on skipping image collections from adjacent paths are calculated. This forms the basis for sampling strategies that can significantly reduce the number of images required to obtain full ground coverage at high latitudes. The calculations show that Antarctica can be covered with approximately one-third the total number of scene opportunities."
Block Bundle Adjustment of Landsat 7 ETM+ Images over Mountainous Areas,"Toutin, Thierry",pp. 1341-1349(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000012/art00002;jsessionid=1usxywc3yate5.x-ic-live-02,"This research study showed the potential of block bundle adjustment with nadir viewing sensor images, such as Landsat 7 ETM+. The method is based on the 3D analytical geometric model developed for multisensor images at the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, Natural Resources Canada. Different block sizes and configurations were tested and compared using an image bundle adjustment. The different tests using 15 Landsat 7 ETM+ images (five paths and three rows) acquired over a study site in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, showed that the same results (around 25-m errors) could be obtained with image blocks as with a single image using a largely reduced number of ground control points (GCPs). However, the combined image measurement and map errors of GCPs were included in the final error budget, and the internal accuracy of the blocks should be better (around one pixel or less). The number of GCPs to be used depended mainly on the cartographic data accuracy: more GCPs than the minimum required reduced the error propagation in the least-squares block bundle adjustment. In addition, tie points with a known elevation value (elevation tie points, ETPs) instead of normal tie points were used to link the adjacent images/strips (north-south and east-west) because the viewing-angle differences of overlapping images were smaller than 1° in north-south overlaps and around 10° in east-west overlaps. Better and more consistent results were also obtained using strips of images in the blocks acquired from the same orbit and date instead of using independent images. Finally, using only GCPs in the outer strips/images and ETPs in each overlap achieved the same results (25-m errors)."
Line-Based Modified Iterated Hough Transform for Autonomous Single-Photo Resection,"Habib, Ayman F.; Lin, Hsiang Tseng; Morgan, Michel F.",pp. 1351-1357(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000012/art00003;jsessionid=1usxywc3yate5.x-ic-live-02,"Automatic single photo resection (SPR) remains to be one of the challenging problems in digital photogrammetry. Earlier attempts to automate the space resection task were mainly point-based, where image-point primitives are first extracted and matched with their object counterparts. The matched primitives are then used to estimate the exterior orientation parameters (EOP). However, visibility and uniqueness of distinct control points in the input imagery limit robust automation of the pose estimation procedure. Recent advances in digital photogrammetry mandate adopting higher-level primitives such as control linear features replacing traditional control points. Linear features can be automatically extracted in image space. On the other hand, object-space control linear features can be extracted from an existing GIS layer containing3Dvector data such as a road network and/or terrestrial mobile mapping systems (MMS). In this paper, we present a line-based approach for simultaneously determining the position and attitude of the involved imagery as well as establishing the correspondence between image- and object-space features. This approach is motivated by the fact that captured imagery over a man-made environment is rich in straight-line segments. Moreover, free-form linear features can be reliably represented with sufficient accuracy by a sequence of straight-line segments (i.e., polylines). The suggested methodology starts by establishing a general mathematical model for relating conjugate straight-line segments to the EOP of the image under consideration. Then, a Modified Iterated Hough Transform (MIHT) strategy is adopted to derive the correspondence between image and object primitives as well as the position and the attitude of the involved imagery. This approach does not necessitate having one-to-one correspondence between image- and object-space primitives, which makes it robust against changes and/or discrepancies between the primitives. The parameter estimation and matching processes follow an optimum sequential procedure, which depends on the sensitivity of the mathematical model, relating corresponding primitives with different orientation at various image regions, to incremental changes in the EOP. Experimental results using real data proved the feasibility and robustness of the proposed approach even in the presence of a large percentage of outliers and/or discrepancies between the image-and object-space features."
Analysis of Terrain Elevation Effects on Ikonos Imagery Rectification Accuracy by Using Non-Rigorous Models,"Shi, Wenzhong; Shaker, Ahmed",pp. 1359-1366(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000012/art00004;jsessionid=1usxywc3yate5.x-ic-live-02,"In the absence of sensor calibration and satellite orbit information for Ikonos satellite imagery, empirical methods have to be adopted for the geometric correction of the images. This paper addresses two major terrain related issues. First, the paper focuses on the effects of terrain variation on the rectification accuracy of Ikonos images using various two-dimensional (2D) transformation models. It was found that (1) the accuracy of rectified coordinates is significantly affected by elevation differences—the greater the differences, the lower the rectified accuracy; (2) for higher accuracy results, ground control points (GCPs) should be projected to a compensation plane before 2D transformation models are applied; and (3) an accuracy of about 0.5 m RMS error can be gained from rectified Ikonos images by utilizing most 2D transformation models when accurate ground control points are available.Second, the paper addresses the effects of terrain variation and the number of GCPs on the obtained ground points accuracy when an eight-parameter affine model is used for 3D ground points determination for stereoscopic Ikonos imagery. It was found that (1) non-collinearity-based 3D orientation and triangulation model can be used successfully in most cases for 3D ground point determination without the need for a camera model or satellite ephemeris data; (2) accuracy up to the sub-pixel level in the X-Y directions and about one pixel in the Z direction can be achieved; (3) the model works significantly better for hilly and mountainous areas than very flat areas; and (4) the accuracy of the results can be improved significantly either by increasing the number of GCPs or by adding topographic constraints."
Comparison of Digital Elevation Models for Aquatic Data Development,"Clarke, Sharon; Burnett, Kelly",pp. 1367-1375(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000012/art00005;jsessionid=1usxywc3yate5.x-ic-live-02,"Thirty-meter digital elevation models (DEMs) produced by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) are widely available and commonly used in analyzing aquatic systems. However, these DEMs are of relatively coarse resolution, were inconsistently produced (i.e., Level 1 versus Level 2 DEMs), and lack drainage enforcement. Such issues may hamper efforts to accurately model streams, delineate hydrologic units (HUs), and classify slope. Thus, the Coastal Landscape Analysis and Modeling Study (CLAMS) compared streams, HUs, and slope classes generated from sample 10-meter drainage-enforced (DE) DEMs and 30-meter DEMs. We found that (1) drainage enforcement improved the spatial accuracy of streams and HU boundaries more than did increasing resolution from 30 meters to 10 meters, particularly in flatter terrain; (2) streams and HU boundaries were generally more accurate when delineated with Level 2 than with Level 1 30-meter DEMs; and (3) the 10-meter DE-DEMs better represented both higher and lower slope classes. These findings prompted us to have 10-meter DE-DEMs produced for the Coast Range Province of Oregon, increased confidence in CLAMS outputs from the 10-meter DE-DEMs, and should benefit others interested in using DEMs for aquatic analyses."
Mapping Urban Areas by Fusing Multiple Sources of Coarse Resolution Remotely Sensed Data,"Schneider, Annemarie; Friedl, Mark A.; McIver, Douglas K.; Woodcock, Curtis E.",pp. 1377-1386(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000012/art00006;jsessionid=1usxywc3yate5.x-ic-live-02,"In recent decades, rapid rates of population growth and urban expansion have led to widespread conversion of natural ecosystems and agricultural lands to urban land cover. The amount and rate of this land conversion affects local and regional ecosystems, climate, biogeochemistry, as well as food production. The main objective of the research described in this paper is to improve understanding of the methodological and validation requirements for mapping urban land cover over large areas from coarse resolution remotely sensed data. A technique called boosting is used to improve supervised classification accuracy and provides a means to integrate MODIS data with the DMSP nighttime lights data set and gridded population data. Results for North America indicate that fusion of these three data types improves urban classification results by resolving confusion between urban and other classes that occurs when any one of the data sets is used by itself. Traditional measures of accuracy assessment as well as new, maplet-based methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology for creating maps of cities at continental scales."
A State-Level Comparative Analysis of the GAP and NLCD Land-Cover Data Sets,"Wardlow, Brian D.; Egbert, Stephen L.",pp. 1387-1397(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000012/art00007;jsessionid=1usxywc3yate5.x-ic-live-02,"Two nationwide land-cover mapping efforts, the GAP Analysis Program (GAP) and the USGS National Land Cover Data (NLCD) program, address the need for intermediate-scale land-cover information to support a diverse user community. The data sets are comparable, but have different objectives, classification systems, and methodologies. A comparative analysis of the GAP and NLCD data sets is needed throughout the United States to determine their relative strengths and limitations and better inform the user community of their applicability for various applications. This study conducted comparative analyses of the GAP and NLCD data sets for Kansas. The data sets were generalized to a common set of land-cover classes, and pixel-level comparisons were made at the state and ecoregion levels. The GAP and NLCD had an overall classification agreement of 67 percent at the state level, with most of the classification disagreement occurring between cropland and grassland. The cropland area classified by GAP was comparable to cropland area estimates reported by the USDA, while NLCD appeared to underestimate cropland and overestimate grassland. The single-date/multiple-data source classification approach and the sub-optimal early-spring dates of Landsat TM data used to produce NLCD resulted in substantial confusion in cropland-grassland discrimination. The multiple-date classification approach used by Kansas GAP provided better discrimination of most land-cover classes. Some classification disagreement, however, was attributable to methodological differences between GAP and NLCD. Accuracy assessment found an overall accuracy of 87 percent for GAP and 81 percent for NLCD, and GAP had higher accuracies for most individual land-cover classes. The Kansas GAP and NLCD land-cover products were found to be comparable in terms of characterizing broad scale land-cover patterns, but the Kansas GAP land-cover map appears to be more appropriate for localized applications that require detailed and accurate land-cover information."
A Comparison of Vector and Raster GIS Methods for Calculating Landscape Metrics Used in Environmental Assessments,"Wade, Timothy G.; Wickham, James D.; Nash, Maliha S.; Neale, Anne C.; Riitters, Kurt H.; Jones, K.

Most of these measurements can be calculated using either raster or vector data formats and processing methods. Raster processes are more commonly used because they can be significantly faster computationally than vector, but error is introduced in converting vector data to raster. This conversion error has been widely studied and quantified, but the impact on environmental assessment results has not been investigated. We examined four GIS-based measurements commonly used in environmental assessments for approximately 1000 watersheds in the state of Maryland and Washington, D.C. Each metric was calculated using vector and raster methods, and estimated values were compared using a paired t-test, Spearman rank correlation, and cluster analyses. Paired t-tests were used to determine the statistical significance of quantitative differences between methods, and Spearman rank correlation and cluster analyses were used to evaluate the impact of the differences on environmental assessments. Paired t-test results indicated significant quantitative differences between methods for three of the four metrics. However, Spearman ranks and cluster analyses indicated that the quantitative differences would not affect environmental assessment results. Spearman rank correlations between vector and raster values were greater than 0.98 for all comparisons. Cluster analyses resulted in identical assignment for 88 percent to over 98 percent of watersheds analyzed among vector and various raster methods."

Although there are a wide range of network types and possible applications in remote sensing, most attention has focused on the use of MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) or FeedForward (FF) networks trained with a backpropagation-learning algorithm for supervised classification. One of the main characteristic elements of an artificial neural network (ANN) is the activation function. Nonlinear logistic (sigmoid and tangent hyperbolic) and linear activation functions have been used effectively with MLP networks for various purposes. The main objective of this study is to compare sigmoid, tangent hyperbolic, and linear activation functions through the one- and two-hidden layered MLP neural network structures trained with the scaled conjugate gradient learning algorithm, and to evaluate their performance on the multispectral Landsat TM imagery classification problem."
Recovery of Systematic Biases in Laser Altimetry Data Using Natural Surfaces,"Filin, Sagi",pp. 1235-1242(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000011/art00002;jsessionid=14iafroxkc5bg.x-ic-live-03,"The accuracy of lidar systems and the removal of systematic errors have received growing attention in recent years. The level of accuracy and the additional processing that is needed for making the raw data ready to use are affected directly by the systematic errors in the laser data. It is evident that calibration of the lidar system, both laboratory and in-flight, are mandatory to alleviate these deficiencies. This paper presents an error recovery model that is based on modeling the system errors and on defining adequate control information. The association of the observations and control information, and configurations that enhance the reliability of the recovered parameters, are also studied here in detail. The application of the model is demonstrated on two of the main error sources in the system, the mounting and the range bias."
Investigating SeaWinds Terrestrial Backscatter,"Hardin, Perry J.; Jackson, Mark W.",pp. 1243-1254(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000011/art00003;jsessionid=14iafroxkc5bg.x-ic-live-03,"Because tropical grasslands play an important role in the storage of global carbon, monitoring them is critical to evaluating global climate change. The goal of this research is to model seasonal SeaWinds Ku-band backscatter in five savanna areas of Colombia, Venezuela, and Brazil as a function of biophysical changes in the savanna landscape. Multiple regression modeling demonstrates that savanna Ku-band backscatter is a function of (1) savanna grass biomass/leaf area, (2) soil moisture, and (3) other soil characteristics. Fit for the regression models is excellent (R = 0.87 and 0.81, respectively, for the horizontal and vertical polarization case). The horizontal–vertical polarization difference is also moderately related to precipitation (R = 0.71). The results from this modeling are consistent with theory predicated on previous C- and X-band research. The possibility of monitoring savanna vegetation, soil moisture, and rainfall using Ku-band radar and scatterometry is discussed."
Grasslands Discriminant Analysis Using Landsat TM Single and Multitemporal Data,"Guo, Xulin; Price, Kevin P.; Stiles, James",pp. 1255-1262(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000011/art00004;jsessionid=14iafroxkc5bg.x-ic-live-03,"Grassland management practices influence many bio- and geophysical processes. The ability to discriminate among different land-use practices is critical to an improved understanding of agro-ecosystem dynamics in the tallgrass prairies of the Central Great Plains. The overall objective of this study was to assess the spectral separability of three land-use practices on warm-season (C4 dominated) and cool-season (C3 dominated) grasslands using data obtained from multitemporal Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery. Results showed that cool- and warm-season grasslands could be discriminated with a high level of accuracy (91.5 percent). When grasslands were categorized by three common management practices (Conservation Reserve Program [CRP], grazing and haying), they could be discriminated with a moderately high level of accuracy (70.4 percent). Grassland management practices within warm- and cool-season grasslands (six types) were spectrally discriminated with a moderate level of accuracy (67.6 percent overall). The use of a three-date Landsat TM image dataset spanning the spring-summer-fall seasons significantly improved classification accuracy over the use of a single-date TM approach."
Estimating Tree Crown Size from Multiresolution Remotely Sensed Imagery,"Song, Conghe; Woodcock, Curtis E.",pp. 1263-1270(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000011/art00005;jsessionid=14iafroxkc5bg.x-ic-live-03,"The spatial arrangement of the brightness values of remotely sensed imagery bears important information for forest canopy structures. This paper presents the theory and a simple analytical model to estimate tree crown size using sills of semivariograms from images at two spatial resolutions. The theoretical basis for the model is that the spatial patterns of multiresolution imagery are diagnostic of tree size. The sills of variograms from images containing larger trees decrease more slowly than those for images containing smaller trees as the image spatial resolution decreases. Tests with generated images, integrated simulation of stand development and its spatial patterns, and Ikonos images show that the model can provide realistic estimates of tree crown size. Errors of the estimated crown size strongly depend on the spatial resolutions of the images. The best combination of spatial resolutions is at the ratio of pixel size to the object size around unity."
Evaluating the Performance of Spatially Explicit Models,"Walker, Robert",pp. 1271-1278(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000011/art00006;jsessionid=14iafroxkc5bg.x-ic-live-03,"Spatially explicit models are now widely used for conducting ecological research and for managing natural resources, due in part to the difficulty of undertaking empirical work at landscape scale. Unfortunately, error assessment and analysis of the predictive ability of such models is not well-developed, and has relied on the Kappa statistic and information-based measures. As has been pointed out, however, such approaches are limited by virtue of their global nature and weak hypotheses. As it turns out, the literature on map accuracy does provide a way of assessing model performance, and the goal of this paper is to adapt this literature to the need for evaluating the predictive ability of spatially explicit models. To this end, the paper first considers inference using the Kappa statistic. This is followed by a commentary on information theory, and a critique of both the Kappa statistic and information-based approaches given their global structure and underlying null hypotheses. A probabilistic treatment of alternative measures recently suggested follows, as does a direct adaptation of map inference to the modeling case. Examples of the proposed measures are given, using an application of logistic regression applied to land-cover changes that have recently occurred in the Muskegon River watershed of the State of Michigan."
Strategies for Integrating Information from Multiple Spatial Resolutions into Land-Use/Land-Cover Classification Routines,"Chen, DongMei; Stow, Douglas",pp. 1279-1287(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000011/art00007;jsessionid=14iafroxkc5bg.x-ic-live-03,"With the development of new remote sensing systems, veryhigh spatial and spectral resolution images now provide a source for detailed and continuous sampling of the Earth’s surface from local to regional scales. This paper presents three strategies for selecting and integrating information from different spatial resolutions into classification routines. One strategy is to combine layers of images of varying resolution. A second strategy involves comparing the a posteriori probabilities of each class at different resolutions. Another strategy is based on a top-down approach starting with the coarsest resolution.The multiresolution strategies are tested using simulated multiresolution images for a portion of the rural-urban fringe of the San Diego Metropolitan Area. The classification accuracy obtained from using three multiple strategies was greater when compared with that from a conventional single-resolution approach. Among the three strategies, the top-down approach resulted in the highest classification accuracy with a Kappa value of 0.648, compared to a Kappa of 0.566 for the conventional classifier."

We suggest an algorithm inspired by the specific problem of updating the Danish National Topographic Map Database (TOP10DK). The emphasis is on buildings, which are very important mapping objects. The algorithm uses vector and spectral data as input to an unsupervised spectral classification method which controls a subsequent Mahalanobis classification step. For evaluation, we present four test cases based on the TOP10DK database in combination with RGB and color-infrared (CIR) aerial photos. A main problem is roofs covered with roofing felt, which are hard to discriminate spectrally from roads. Apart from that, RGB photos are barely sufficient for change detection, while CIR data give more satisfactory results. Refinements are, however, still needed to reduce the number of false alarms."

With desktop geographic information systems now ubiquitous, source data available as a commodity from private industry, and the realization that many complex problems faced by society need far more and different kinds of spatial data for their solutions, national mapping organizations must realign their business strategies to meet growing demand and anticipate the needs of a rapidly changing geographic information environment.The National Mapof the United States builds on a sound historic foundation of describing and monitoring the land surface and adds a focused effort to produce improved understanding, modeling, and prediction of land-surface change. These added dimensions bring to bear a broader spectrum of geographic science to address extant and emerging issues. Within the overarching construct ofThe National Map,the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is making a transition from data collector to guarantor of national data completeness; from producing paper maps to supporting an online, seamless, integrated database; and from simply describing the Nation’s landscape to linking these descriptions with increased scientific understanding. Implementing the full spectrum of geographic science addresses a myriad of public policy issues, including land and natural resource management, recreation, urban growth, human health, and emergency planning, response, and recovery. Neither these issues nor the science and technologies needed to deal with them are static. A robust research agenda is needed to understand these changes and realizeThe National Mapvision.

However, some Federal agencies have been partnering successfully for many decades. Two such agencies, the Department of Commerce’s U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of the Interior’s U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), have had partnerships that resulted in fundamental changes to the field of geographic data processing. While these agencies had cooperated successfully on projects earlier, from 1983 to 1989, they conducted a major partnership that resulted in the creation of the USGS’ 1:100,000-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) and the Census Bureau’s Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) database. These datasets changed not only Federal geographic data processing practices but also set the course for future geographic data processing in state, local, and tribal governments, as well as in academia and private industry.Now, both agencies have embarked on ambitious programs to improve and evolve their datasets to meet more demanding Federal and other needs for the coming decades. The Census Bureau is improving its combined Master Address File (MAF) and TIGER database through an effort known as the MAF/TIGER Accuracy Improvement Project (MTAIP). Simultaneously, the USGS is undertaking the creation ofThe National Map,the initial foundation of which is existing datasets such as the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). Although each agency’s program objectives are unique to their respective missions, the products of their labors are, once again, complementary. Given their history of partnership, it was logical for the Census Bureau and the USGS to again share risks and results. Commonalities between their respective databases and missions have been identified and an effort launched to reduce redundancy in data collection and preparation, while still assuring the objectives of the resulting databases are achieved and meet the overarching objectives of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI)."

The Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS), a division of the Texas Water Development Board, is charged with producing, archiving, updating, and distributing Texas base maps. To fulfill this responsibility, TNRIS is taking a new and more efficient approach based on the USGS National Map concept.At the heart ofThe National Map“of Texas” is the concept that different digital map themes can be combined to make new mapping products. Texas has digital transportation, hypsography, aerial photography, hydrography, boundaries, soils, and other datasets that can be overlaid digitally to create both standard and custom maps. Because maps can be built using solely digital sources, there are many input options and many forms of output, e.g., printed maps, files, and Internet displays.Texas is building a new statewide mapping product based onThe National Mapprinciples that complements USGS 1:24,000-scale topographic maps. While these new maps share the same 7.5-minute footprint and similar appearance, they will be comprised solely of digital base-map themes.

A Data Provider’s View ofThe National Map,"Cooke, Donald",pp. 1155-1158(4),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000010/art00008;jsessionid=2m9cdnievm5og.x-ic-live-02,"For over a century, our national map consisted of the thousands of paper topographic quadrangle maps created and maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) at scales ranging from 1:250,000 to 1:24,000. As long as the Nation’s spatial data were embodied in paper maps, the linkage between private sector data providers and the USGS was tenuous: the USGS contracted for mapping services and map publishers might use quadrangle maps as the basis for a commercial map, but the relationship rarely went further.As the computer age impinged on mapping of the Nation, the linkage between public and private mapping grew tighter. Private companies became important resources in public map database compilation, and public digital maps seeded new private data products.The National Mapvision promulgated in 2001 by the USGS opens new avenues for public-private collaboration on this vital resource. Commercial data providers can work with government at all levels to their mutual benefit to achieveThe National Mapvision."

As part of the Nation’s geospatial data industry, the DeLorme Publishing Company competes, in part, in a marketplace built largely upon data produced and made available by the USGS and other governmental agencies. These data, and this marketplace, have benefited citizens through a wide array of software, data, services, and products.The National Map,as proposed by the USGS, has the potential for further stimulating this marketplace, thereby resulting in more and better geospatial products, ultimately further benefiting citizens.

A New Geographic Information Framework for Great Britain,"Murray, Keith J.; Shiell, Duncan",pp. 1175-1182(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000010/art00012;jsessionid=2m9cdnievm5og.x-ic-live-02,"The knowledge economy, enabled by easier and faster electronic processing, has brought geography to the fore in the minds of a wide variety of users, from politicians, government, and the commercial sector and to the citizen. This appears to be a make or break moment for national mapping agencies involved in mapping and geography. Geographic information, more than mapping, is now in demand. This information needs to fulfill specific roles and needs for the people who use it, often by integrating with all kinds of existing information, such as client inventories, property information, and consumer services for “where is my nearest?”The Ordnance Survey (OS) embarked on a program to redevelop the existing National Topographic Database in the late 1990s and this is now being transformed with the release of the OS MasterMap based on the Digital National Framework, which is a conceptual model and standards for integrating geographic information.There are several parallels withThe National Mapbeing developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Both initiatives aim to provide national, complete, and maintained geo-referencing frameworks that can unite data from all kinds of organizations through the common denominator: location. The initiatives each aim to offer easy access to users who can choose just those geographic areas and layers of information they require for their application. There are also differences in the way the data will be maintained and how the supporting business models operate. For example, in Great Britain, the user pays full data licence costs while, in the United States, data are provided at the cost of dissemination.It remains to be seen just how successful these initiatives will be in the longer term and it is likely that the strategies will have to evolve. One thing is clear. Without a modern national georeferencing infrastructure and the ability to effortlessly join up all kinds of disparate geographies, our national economies will be weaker and much duplication and fragmentation will be evident. In Great Britain we encountered such a situation in the 1920s and 30s, which led to a fundamental review and established the foundations for the remit and type of organization the Ordnance Survey is today. As national mapping organizations worldwide redefine themselves in an e-business environment, the future today looks to be challenging but is also offering exciting opportunities. We can learn a lot from each other."

As a consequence, location-based information relating to people, activities, and resources is critical to informed decision making within both the private and public sectors. It therefore stands to reason that information required to establish the geospatial framework in which all location-based information exists must be readily available to those who make decisions. This need for a consistent, seamless, and accessible framework of geospatial information is internationally recognized. Within the United States it will be the U.S. Geological Survey’sThe National Mapinitiative that provides the vehicle to achieve this result. Within Aus-tralia this outcome has been achieved through Public Sector Mapping Agencies (PSMA) Australia Limited. While both the U.S. and Australia acknowledge and pursue ultimately the same goal—to deliver a national geospatial framework—the mechanism that has evolved in Australia over the last decade stands out because of both its unique model and continuing success."

A Comparison of Urban Mapping Methods Using High-Resolution Digital Imagery,"Thomas, Nancy; Hendrix, Chad; Congalton, Russell G.",pp. 963-972(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000009/art00002;jsessionid=wvqs1ydlljkr.x-ic-live-03,"Recent advances in digital airborne sensors and satellite platforms make spatially accurate, high-resolution multispectral imagery readily available. These advances provide the opportunity for a host of new applications to address and solve old problems. High-resolution imagery is particularly well suited to urban applications. Previous data sources (such as Landsat TM) did not show the spatial detail necessary to provide many urban planning solutions. This paper provides an overview of a project in which one-meter digital imagery was used to produce a map of pervious and impervious surfaces to be used by the city of Scottsdale, Arizona for storm-water runoff estimation. The increased spatial information in one-meter or less resolution imagery strains the usefulness of image classification using traditional supervised and unsupervised spectral classification algorithms. This study assesses the accuracy of three different methods for extracting land-cover/land-use information from high-resolution imagery of urban environments: (1) combined supervised/unsupervised spectral classification, (2) raster-based spatial modeling, and (3) image segmentation classification using classification tree analysis. A discussion of the results and relative merits of each method is included."
Synergistic Use of Lidar and Color Aerial Photography for Mapping Urban Parcel Imperviousness,"Hodgson, Michael E.; Jensen, John R.; Tullis, Jason A.; Riordan, Kevin D.; Archer, Clark M.",pp. 973-980(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000009/art00003;jsessionid=wvqs1ydlljkr.x-ic-live-03,"The imperviousness of land parcels was mapped and evaluated using high spatial resolution digitized color orthophotog-raphy and surface-cover height extracted from multiple-return lidar data. Maximum-likelihood classification, spectral clustering, and expert system approaches were used to extract the impervious information from the datasets. Classified pixels (or segments) were aggregated to parcels. The classification model based on the use of both the orthophotography and lidar-derived surface-cover height yielded impervious surface results for all parcels that were within 15 percent of reference data. The standard error for the rule-based per-pixel model was 7.15 percent with a maximum observed error of 18.94 percent. The maximum-likelihood per-pixel classification yielded a lower standard error of 6.62 percent with a maximum of 14.16 percent. The regression slope (i.e., 0.955) for the maximum-likelihood per-pixel model indicated a near perfect relationship between observed and predicted imperviousness. The additional effort of using a per-segment approach with a rule-based classification resulted in slightly better standard error (5.85 percent) and a near-perfect regression slope (1.016)."
Comparing ARTMAP Neural Network with the Maximum-Likelihood Classifier for Detecting Urban Change,"Seto, Karen C.; Liu, Weiguo",pp. 981-990(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000009/art00004;jsessionid=wvqs1ydlljkr.x-ic-live-03,"Urbanization has profound effects on the environment at local, regional, and global scales. Effective detection of urban change using remote sensing data will be an essential component of global environmental change research, regional planning, and natural resource management. This paper presents results from an ARTMAP neural network to detect urban change with Landsat TM images from two periods. Classification of urban change, and, in particular, conversion of agriculture to urban, was statistically more accurate with ARTMAP than with a more conventional technique, the Bayesian maximum-likelihood classifier (MLC). The effect of different levels of class aggregation on the performance of change detection was also explored with ARTMAP and MLC. Because ARTMAP explicitly allows “many-to-one” mapping, classification using coarse class resolution and fine class resolution training data generated similar results. Together, these results suggest that ARTMAP can reduce labor and computational costs associated with assembling training data while concurrently generating more accurate urban change-detection results."
Spatial Metrics and Image Texture for Mapping Urban Land Use,"Herold, Martin; Liu, XiaoHang; Clarke, Keith C.",pp. 991-1001(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000009/art00005;jsessionid=wvqs1ydlljkr.x-ic-live-03,"The arrival of new-generation, high-spatial-resolution satellite imagery (e.g., Ikonos) has opened up new opportunities for detailed mapping and analysis of urban land use. Drawing on the traditional approach used in aerial photointerpretation, this study investigates an “object-oriented” method to classify a large urban area into detailed land-use categories. Spatial metrics and texture measures are used to describe the spatial characteristics of land-cover objects within each land-use region as derived from interpreted aerial photographs. In assessing how land-use categories vary in their spatial configuration, spatial metrics were found to provide the most important information for differentiating urban land uses. A detailed land-use map with nine categories was derived for the Santa Barbara South Coast Region area. Results from our work suggest that the region-based method exploiting spatial metrics and texture measurements is a potential new avenue to extract detailed urban land-use information from high-resolution satellite imagery."
Urban Land-Cover Change Detection through Sub-Pixel Imperviousness Mapping Using Remotely Sensed Data,"Yang, Limin; Xian, George; Klaver, Jacqueline M.; Deal, Brian",pp. 1003-1010(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000009/art00006;jsessionid=wvqs1ydlljkr.x-ic-live-03,"We developed a Sub-pixel Imperviousness Change Detection (SICD) approach to detect urban land-cover changes using Landsat and high-resolution imagery. The sub-pixel percent imperviousness was mapped for two dates (09 March 1993 and 11 March 2001) over western Georgia using a regression tree algorithm. The accuracy of the predicted imperviousness was reasonable based on a comparison using independent reference data. The average absolute error between predicted and reference data was 16.4 percent for 1993 and 15.3 percent for 2001. The correlation coefficient (r) was 0.73 for 1993 and 0.78 for 2001, respectively. Areas with a significant increase (greater than 20 percent) in impervious surface from 1993 to 2001 were mostly related to known land-cover/land-use changes that occurred in this area, suggesting that the spatial change of an impervious surface is a useful indicator for identifying spatial extent, intensity, and, potentially, type of urban land-cover/land-use changes. Compared to other pixel-based change-detection methods (band differencing, rationing, change vector, post-classification), information on changes in sub-pixel percent imperviousness allow users to quantify and interpret urban land-cover/land-use changes based on their own definition. Such information is considered complementary to products generated using other change-detection methods. In addition, the procedure for mapping imperviousness is objective and repeatable, hence, can be used for monitoring urban land-cover/land-use change over a large geographic area. Potential applications and limitations of the products developed through this study in urban environmental studies are also discussed."
Measuring the Physical Composition of Urban Morphology Using Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Models,"Rashed, Tarek; Weeks, John R.; Roberts, Dar; Rogan, John; Powell, Rebecca",pp. 1011-1020(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000009/art00007;jsessionid=wvqs1ydlljkr.x-ic-live-03,"The application of multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) to map the physical composition of urban morphology using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data is evaluated and tested. MESMA models mixed pixels as linear combinations of pure spectra, called endmembers, while allowing the types and number of endmembers to vary on a per-pixel basis. A total of 63 two-, three-, and four-endmember models were applied to a Landsat TM image for Los Angeles County, and a smaller subset of these models was chosen based on fraction and root-mean-squared error (RMSE) criteria. From this subset, an optimal model was selected for each pixel based on optimization for maximum area coverage. The resultant endmember fractions were then mapped into four main components of urban land cover: Vegetation, Impervious surfaces, Soil, and Water/Shade. The mapped fractions were validated using aerial photos. The results showed that a majority of the image could be modeled successfully with two- or three-endmember models. The validation results indicated the robustness of MESMA for deriving spatially continuous variables quantified at the sub-pixel level. These parameters can be readily integrated into a wide range of applications and models concerned with physical, economic, and/or socio-demographic phenomena that influence the morphological patterns of the city."

The resulting housing-unit sprawl indicator measurements are summarized by municipality to provide a “sprawl report card.” The analysis provides a new direction in sprawl research that addresses sprawl at the atomic level, captures the temporal nature of urban growth, and provides measures that are potentially useful to planners addressing sprawl."

These methods were applied at both city and census-tract levels and were evaluated against the actual population growth. It was found that accurate population growth estimates are achieved by both methods. At the census-tract level, our models yielded a comparable result with that obtained from a more complex commercial demographics model. At both city and census-tract levels, models using road development were better than those using land-use change detection. In addition to being efficient in cost and time, our models provide direct visualization of the distribution of the actual population growth within cities and census tracts when compared to commercial demographic models."

Most of the existing CA just focus on simulating realistic urban dynamics. This paper demonstrates that development alternatives can be simulated by incorporating planning objectives in CA. It is important to define appropriate parameter values for simulating development alternatives according to the planning objectives of planners and decision makers. Training neural networks can automatically yield the parameter values for urban simulation. GIS and remote sensing provide the training data for calibrating the model. However, the simulation can inherit past land-use problems if the original training data are used to calibrate the model. The original data should be assessed and modified so that the model can remember the past “failure” in land development. Planning objectives can thus be embedded in the model by properly modifying the training data sets. The training is robust because it is based on the well-defined back-propagation algorithm. Experiments were carried out by using the city of Dongguan, China as an example to test the model."

Dramatic changes in land use and land cover have occurred, with loss of forest and cropland to urban use. In particular, low-density urban use, which includes largely residential use, has increased by over 119 percent between 1973 and 1997. These land-use and land-cover changes have drastically altered the land surface characteristics. An analysis of Landsat images revealed an increase in surface temperature and a decline in NDVI from 1973 to 1997. These changes have forced the development of a significant urban heat island effect at both the urban canopy and urban boundary layers as well as an increase in ground level ozone production to such an extent that Atlanta has violated EPA’s ozone level standard in recent years. Using canonical correlation analysis, surface temperatures and NDVI, extracted from Landsat TM images, were found to correlate strongly with volatile organic compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, the two ingredients that form ozone by reacting with sunlight, but only weakly with the rates of cardiovascular and chronic lower respiratory diseases, which also did not exhibit strong correlation with VOC and NOx emissions, possibly because other factors such as demographic and socio-economic may also be involved. Further research is therefore needed to understand the health geography and its relationship to land-use and land-cover change. This paper illustrates the usefulness of a remote sensing approach for this purpose."

The nominal accuracy of ground point determination with vendor-provided Rational Function (RF) coefficients is evaluated and systematic errors are found when compared with ground control points. A significant improvement in the accuracy is achieved by a refining process that applies a three-dimensional affine transformation to the RF-calculated 3D ground points to correct the systematic errors. A DEM is automatically generated by a chain of processes: area-based image matching, ground point calculation, outlier elimination, TIN construction, and interpolation. Following DEM generation, an orthoimage is produced using the DEM and the refined geometric model. Accuracies of the DEM and the orthoimage as assessed from independent checkpoints (ICPs) are approximately 2 m in planimetry and 3 m in height. Finally, a 3D shoreline is extracted through manual digitization in one image of a stereo pair and then automatic matching in the other image. Issues concerning the production of digital tide-coordinated shorelines using instantaneous observations are also discussed."
Fast Approximation of Visibility Dominance Using Topographic Features as Targets and the Associated Uncertainty,"Rana, Sanjay",pp. 881-888(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000008/art00002;jsessionid=4abo92gj4i4gc.x-ic-live-03,"An approach to reduce visibility index computation time and measure the associated uncertainty in terrain visibility analyses is presented. It is demonstrated that the visibility index computation time in mountainous terrain can be reduced substantially, without any significant information loss, if the line of sight from each observer on the terrain is drawn only to the fundamental topographic features, i.e., peaks, pits, passes, ridges, and channels. However, the selected sampling of targets results in an underestimation of the visibility index of each observer. Two simple methods based on iterative comparisons between the real visibility indices and the estimated visibility indices have been proposed for a preliminary assessment of this uncertainty. The method has been demonstrated for gridded digital elevation models."
Mapping Multiple Variables for Predicting Soil Loss by Geostatistical Methods with TM Images and a Slope Map,"Wang, Guangxing; Gertner, George; Fang, Shoufan; Anderson, Alan B.",pp. 889-898(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000008/art00003;jsessionid=4abo92gj4i4gc.x-ic-live-03,"Soil erosion is widely predicted as a function of six input factors, including rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, slope length, slope steepness, cover management, and support practice. Because of the multiple factors, their interactions, and their spatial and temporal variability, accurately mapping the factors and further soil loss is very difficult. This paper compares two geostatistical methods and a traditional stratification to map the factors and to estimate soil loss. Soil loss is estimated by integrating a sample ground data set, TM images, and a slope map. The geostatistical methods include collocated cokriging and a joint sequential co-simulation model. With both geostatistical methods, local estimates and variances at any location where the factors and soil loss are unknown can be computed. The results showed that the two geostatistical methods performed significantly better than traditional stratification in terms of overall and spatially explicit estimates. Furthermore, the cokriging led to higher accuracy of mean estimates than did the co-simulation, while the latter provided decision makers with reliable uncertainties of the local estimates as useful information to assess risk when making decisions based on the prediction maps."
AVHRR-Based Spectral Vegetation Index for Quantitative Assessment of Vegetation State and Productivity,"Kogan, Felix; Gitelson, Anatoly; Zakarin, Edige; Spivak, Lev; Lebed, Lubov",pp. 899-906(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000008/art00004;jsessionid=4abo92gj4i4gc.x-ic-live-03,"The goal of the work was to estimate, quantitatively, vegetation state and productivity using AVHRR-based Vegetation Condition Index (VCI). The VCI algorithm includes application of post-launch calibration to visible channels, calculation of NDVI from channels’ reflectance, removal of high-frequency noise from NDVI’s annual time series, stratification of ecosystem resources, and separation of ecosystem and weather components in the NDVI value. The weather component was calculated by normalizing the NDVI to the difference of the extreme NDVI fluctuations (maximum and minimum), derived from multi-year data for each week and land pixel. The VCI was compared with wheat density measured in Kazakhstan. Six test fields were located in different climatic (annual precipitation 150 to 700 mm) and ecological (semi-desert to steppe-forest) zones with elevations from 200 to 700 m and a wide range of NDVI variation over space and season from 0.05 to 0.47. Plant density (PD) was measured in wheat fields by calculating the number of stems per unit area. PD deviation from year to year (PDD) was expressed as a deviation from median density calculated from multi-year data. The correlation between PDD and VCI for all stations was positive and quite strong (r2 > 0.75) with the Standard Errors of Estimates (SEE) of PDD less than 16 percent; for individual stations, the SEE was less than 11 percent. The results indicate that VCI is an appropriate index for monitoring weather impact on vegetation and for assessment of pasture and crop productivity in Kazakhstan. Because satellite observations provide better spatial and temporal coverage, the VCI-based system will provide efficient tools for management of water resources and the improvement of agricultural planning. This system will serve as a prototype in the other parts of the world where ground observations are limited or not available."

We demonstrate how to derive REA from an error matrix and its relationship with user’s and producer’s accuracy. We compare the REA index with other accuracy indices in a hypothetical and two real case studies. The accuracy of cover-class areal estimates is highly correlated with the REA index, but not with other classification accuracy indices such as the overall classification accuracy. In general, users should beware of using thematic maps with low REA values. Moreover, the estimates of cover-class area can be revised by using REA if cell values of the major diagonal in an error matrix are available."

Using digital color imagery acquired over the Haleakala Crater on Maui, Hawai’i, we evaluated the accuracy of photointerpretation and automated censuses by imaging nine silversword census plots characterized by individuals of known size, life cycle status, and location. Due to spatial resolution limitations, both methods tended to omit small individuals, but omissions varied by size class and type of omission. Omission rates were low for demographically important medium and large plants; however, the automated method often failed to segment and census tightly clustered plants. The photointerpreter commission error rate was lower than that of the automated method, and both methods tended to overestimate mean silversword size. These data outline the issues and challenges that will likely emerge as spatially explicit, high spatial resolution aerial censuses become more common."
A Spatial Filter for the Removal of Striping Artifacts in Digital Elevation Models,"Albani, Marco; Klinkenberg, Brian",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000007/art00001;jsessionid=foku9ntd6cx6.x-ic-live-03,"Elongated topographic artifacts, such as the striping production artifacts described for USGS 7.5-minute DEMs, can result in globally biased estimates of slope and aspect. As such, developing methods to reduce these artifacts and their resulting biases is important. This study presents an algorithm for the mitigation of these artifacts, using Terrain Resource Information Management (TRIM) digital elevation models (DEMs) of the Fort St. John Forest District, in British Colum-bia, Canada, as the test bed. The algorithm uses a theoretical error model, where elevation measurement errors are assumed to be autocorrelated along the collection lines of the photogrammetric model, and takes advantage of the entry order of DEM points to apply a sequence of spatial filters to the elevation. A probability function is used to constrain the elevation changes to an acceptable range. The algorithm is effective in mitigating the artifacts’ effects on slope and aspect while preserving the original topographic detail."
A Fast Algorithm for Approximate Viewshed Computation,"Izraelevitz, David",pp. 767-774(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000007/art00002;jsessionid=foku9ntd6cx6.x-ic-live-03,"Given a terrain model, the viewshed from a viewpoint is computed as the set ofX-Ypositions of a point target such that the target is visible. We introduce a novel approach to the computation of accurate viewshed approximations. Our algorithm relies on the computation of an approximation to the so-called line-of-sight (LOS) function. This function is defined over targetX-Ypositions, and is the highest elevation of a target so that it is still occluded from the viewpoint. The LOS function summarizes intervisibility information and permits reuse of previous intervisibility computations, resulting in computational efficiencies. Our algorithm gives results very close to the traditional sightline ray method at a substantially smaller computational cost, and is a generalization of the approach developed by Franklin and Ray for the same problem. We describe in detail the application to gridded terrain models, but the approach is similarly applicable to other elevation models."
Urban Subsidence Monitoring Using Radar Interferometry,"Crosetto, Michele; Castillo, Manuel; Arbiol, Roman",pp. 775-783(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000007/art00003;jsessionid=foku9ntd6cx6.x-ic-live-03,"The differential interferometric SAR (DInSAR) technique has proved its capability to detect small surface deformations in several types of applications. In this paper, its use as a quantitative subsidence monitoring tool is addressed to. A complete procedure is described, giving emphasis to the algorithms that have a major impact on the quality of the DInSAR results: the calibration of the InSAR geometry based on ground control points, which guarantees a high accuracy of the InSAR geometric model; a filtering procedure suitable to reduce the atmospheric effects in small-scale subsidences; and a data fusion procedure for multiple observations, which represents a key step to improve the quality of the DInSAR products. The procedure was used in the analysis of a small-scale urban subsidence located in Cat-alonia, northeastern Spain. The validation of the results, which was based on the comparison with precise and independent reference data, is discussed in detail."
Impact of Topographic Normalization on Land-Cover Classification Accuracy,"Hale, Stephen R.; Rock, Barrett N.",pp. 785-791(7),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000007/art00004;jsessionid=foku9ntd6cx6.x-ic-live-03,"For pixel classifying algorithms to perform effectively, effects of topographic relief must be minimized or removed. In areas of high topographic relief, problems arise when spectral variations in ground target illumination and radiance, owing to differences in incident radiation and non-Lambertian reflectance behavior, respectively, cause identical land-cover types to reflect differently, or different cover types to reflect similarly. A Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper image was processed using band ratios, the Min-naert Correction, aspect partitioning, and combinations of these treatments to generate independent land-cover classifications. Treatment classification accuracy was determined using error matrices and the Kappa statistic. Producer’s and User’s Accuracies were examined to determine if treatments were superior at producing greater class-specific accuracy. None of the treatments produced a significantly more accurate classification; however, assessment of class-specific accuracies indicated accuracy gains using aspect partitioning alone or in combination with the Minnaert Correction."
Land-Cover Change Monitoring with Classification Trees Using Landsat TM and Ancillary Data,"Rogan, John; Miller, Jennifer; Stow, Doug; Franklin, Janet; Levien, Lisa; Fischer, Chris",pp. 793-804(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000007/art00005;jsessionid=foku9ntd6cx6.x-ic-live-03,"We monitored land-cover change in San Diego County (1990–1996) using multitemporal Landsat TM data. Change vectors of Kauth Thomas features were combined with stable multitemporal Kauth Thomas features and a suite of ancillary variables within a classification tree classifier. A combination of aerial photointerpretation and field measurements yielded training and validation data. Maps of land-cover change were generated for three hierarchical levels of change classification of increasing detail: change vs. no-change; four classes representing broad increase and decrease classes; and nine classes distinguishing increases or decreases in tree canopy cover, shrub cover, and urban change. The multitemporal Kauth Thomas (both stable and change features representing brightness, greenness, and wetness) provided information for magnitude and direction of land-cover change. Overall accuracies of the land-cover change maps were high (72 to 92 percent). Ancillary variables representing elevation, fire history, and slope were most significant in mapping the most complicated level of land-cover change, contributing 15 percent to overall accuracy. Classification trees have not previously been used operationally with remotely sensed and ancillary data to map land-cover change at this level of thematic detail."

This article focuses on an area of 3,000 km2within the Brazilian State of Rondônia. Two adjacent settlements were compared to assess the role of their different designs in landscape change. Anari was planned following an orthogonal road network. Machadinho was designed with attention to topography in laying out roads and farm properties, while including communal reserves. Field research was undertaken in conjunction with multi-temporal classifications of remotely sensed data (1988, 1994, and 1998) and landscape ecology methods. The results indicate that large patches of communal reserves play an important role in maintaining lower levels of fragmentation. Analyses of landscape structure confirmed that forest patches in Machadinho are less fragmented, more complex, and preserve more interior habitat. By comparing the effects of different settlement designs on landscape change and forest fragmentation, this article contributes to the debate about colonization strategies in Amazônia."

Often this variability can be related to differences in soil properties (e.g., texture, organic matter, salinity levels, and nutrient status) within the field. To develop management approaches to address this variability, high spatial resolution soil property maps are often needed. Some soil properties have been related directly to a soil spectral response, or inferred based on remotely sensed measurements of crop canopies, including soil texture, nitrogen level, organic matter content, and salinity status. While many studies have obtained promising results, several interfering factors can limit approaches solely based on spectral response, including tillage conditions and crop residue. A number of different ground-based sensors have been used to rapidly assess soil properties “on the go” (e.g., sensor mounted on a tractor and data mapped with coincident position information) and the data from these sensors compliment image-based data. On-the-go sensors have been developed to rapidly map soil organic matter content, electrical conductivity, nitrate content, and compaction. Model and statistical methods show promise to integrate these groundand image-based data sources to maximize the information from each source for soil property mapping."

The major contributions are separated into deriving from remote sensing (1) hydrometeorological state variables and (2) energy fluxes, particularly evapotranspiration which includes plant water stress. For the state variables, remote sensing algorithms have been developed for estimating land surface temperatures from brightness temperature observations correcting for atmospheric and emissivity effects, estimating near-surface soil moisture from passive microwave remote sensing, determining snow cover from visible and snow water equivalent from microwave data, and estimating landscape roughness, topography, vegetation height, and fractional cover from lidar distancing technology. For the hydrometeorological fluxes, including plant water stress, models estimating evapotranspiration have been developed using land surface temperature as a key boundary condition with recent schemes designed to more reliably handle partial vegetation cover conditions. These research efforts in estimating evapotranspiration with remotely sensed surface temperatures have been utilized by ARS researchers in the development of the Crop Water Stress Index and Water Deficit Index for assessing plant water stress. In addition, the development of the Thermal Kinetic Window and Crop Specific Temperatures have revealed the dynamic interactions among foliage temperature, plant species, and the physical environment. ARS researchers continue to develop new and improved remote sensing algorithms for evaluating state variables and fluxes. Moreover, they are involved in new research directions to address science questions impeding hydrometeorological research. These include investigating the utility of combining multifrequency remote sensing data for improved estimation of land surface properties, and incorporating remote sensing for evaluating the effects of landscape heterogeneity on atmospheric dynamics and mean air properties and resulting feedbacks on the land surface fluxes."

The National Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture conducts field interviews with sampled farm operators and obtains crop cuttings to make crop yield estimates at regional and state levels. NASS needs supplemental spatial data that provides timely information on crop condition and potential yields. In this research, the crop model EPIC (Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator) was adapted for simulations at regional scales. Satellite remotely sensed data provide a real-time assessment of the magnitude and variation of crop condition parameters, and this study investigates the use of these parameters as an input to a crop growth model. This investigation was conducted in the semi-arid region of North Dakota in the southeastern part of the state. The primary objective was to evaluate a method of integrating parameters retrieved from satellite imagery in a crop growth model to simulate spring wheat yields at the sub-county and county levels. The input parameters derived from remotely sensed data provided spatial integrity, as well as a real-time calibration of model simulated parameters during the season, to ensure that the modeled and observed conditions agree. A radiative transfer model, SAIL (Scattered by Arbitrary Inclined Leaves), provided the link between the satellite data and crop model. The model parameters were simulated in a geographic information system grid, which was the platform for aggregating yields at local and regional scales. A model calibration was performed to initialize the model parameters. This calibration was performed using Landsat data over three southeast counties in North Dakota. The model was then used to simulate crop yields for the state of North Dakota with inputs derived from NOAA AVHRR data. The calibration and the state level simulations are compared with spring wheat yields reported by NASS objective yield surveys."

Assessment and monitoring of rangelands are currently based on comparing the plant species present in relation to an expected successional end-state defined by the ecological site. In the future, assessment and monitoring may be based on indicators of ecosystem health, including sustainability of soil, sustainability of plant production, and presence of invasive weed species.USDAAgricultural Research Service(ARS)scientists are actively engaged in developing quantitative, repeatable, and low-cost methods to measure indicators of ecosystem health using remote sensing. Noxious weed infestations can be determined by careful selection of the spatial resolution, spectral bands, and timing of image acquisition. Rangeland productivity can be estimated with either Landsat or Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer data using models of gross primary production based on radiation use efficiency. Lidar measurements are useful for canopy structure and soil roughness, indicating susceptibility to erosion. The value of remote sensing for rangeland management depends in part on combining the imagery with other spatial data within geographic information systems. Finally, ARSscientists are developing the knowledge on which future range-land assessment and monitoring tools will be developed."

Recent and planned launches of satellites with improved spectral and spatial resolution sensors should lead to greater use of remote sensing techniques to assess and monitor water quality parameters. Integration of remotely sensed data, GPS, and GIS technologies provides a valuable tool for monitoring and assessing waterways. Remotely sensed data can be used to create a permanent geographically located database to provide a baseline for future comparisons.

Multi-Band Wavelet for Fusing SPOT Panchromatic and Multispectral Images,"Shi, Wenzhong; Zhu, Changqing; Zhu, Caiying; Yang, Xiaomei",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000005/art00001;jsessionid=ic46fke8c7rh.x-ic-live-02,"With the development of remote sensing technology, fusion of remotely sensed images, such as SPOT panchromatic (SPOT P) with SPOT multispectral images (SPOT XS) or Land-sat Thematic Mapper (TM), has become more important in order to obtain richer information in the spatial and spectral domains simultaneously. Many fusion methods have been developed based on the two-band wavelet transformation. However, due to the limitations of the transformation characteristics themselves, the two-band wavelet is not very efficient for the fusion of images whose ratio of spatial resolutions is not 2n(n=1, 2, 3,...), e.g., for fusing a 10-m resolution panchromatic SPOT image and with 30-m resolution multispectral TM images. However, a recently developed new wavelet branch—multi-band wavelet—can potentially be applied to solve this problem.In this paper, we develop a new approach for fusing SPOT P images with multispectral TM images based on multi-band wavelet transformation. First, the theoretical basis of multi-band wavelet is presented and its transformation properties are analyzed. Second, a new method for fusing a SPOT P image with multispectral images using the multi-band wavelet is proposed. Specifically, the three-band wavelet is implemented to fuse 10-m SPOT panchromatic and 30-m multispectral TM images. Third, this new method is compared with previous methods such as the two-band wavelet and IHS methods for image fusion. The proposed multi-band wavelet approach demonstrates an improvement in spatial and spectral characteristics for fusing SPOT P and multispectral TM images."

An important requirement for application of the physical models is detailed information on atmospheric humidity and particles. Here, a method is described for making atmospheric corrections without the need for detailed atmospheric observations. A simplified procedure for making atmospheric corrections to reflectances observed from satellites is developed by using the unique spectral signature of water pixels in satellite images. A radiative transfer model is applied to a variety of clear-sky conditions to generate functional relationships between the radiation due to the atmospheric scattering above water bodies and atmospheric radiative properties. Test cases indicate that the resulting estimates of surface reflectances and NDVI agree well with estimates made using a radiative transfer model applied independently and with measurements made at the surface."
Comparison of Gray-Level Reduction and Different Texture Spectrum Encoding Methods for Land-Use Classification Using a Panchromatic Ikonos Image,"Xu, Bing; Gong, Peng; Seto, Edmund; Spear, Robert",pp. 529-536(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000005/art00003;jsessionid=ic46fke8c7rh.x-ic-live-02,"In this paper, we evaluate the potential of a frequency-based contextual classifier (FBC) for land-use classification with a panchromatic Ikonos image. To capture the spatial arrangement of image gray-level values and use such information in image classification, we applied texture spectrum (TS) directly in the FBC. The effects of several data preprocessing and reduction methods on the performance of the FBC are also evaluated. The methods include four gray-level reduction (GLR) techniques and several modifications to the TS technique. The purpose of data reduction is to improve the classification efficiency of the FBC. The GLR schemes were min-max linear compression (LC), gray level binning (BN), histogram equalization (HE), and piece-wise nonlinear compression (PC). Instead of using the texture measures derived from the texture spectrum, we directly applied texture spectra of various sizes in the classification. We modified the encoding algorithm in the TS and were able to reduce the number of texture units from its original 6561 to 256, 81, and 16, leading to as much as a 410 times computation efficiency. The original image and GLR images were subsequently classified with the FBC. We compared the classification accuracies and found that the GLR methods resulted in accuracies similar to that of the original image (within 0.03 kappa value). There was little difference in classification accuracy (within 0.03 kappa value) among the three modified TS methods, which were all outperformed by the original TS method. All TS methods performed considerably better than the use of the original image and the GLR methods."
Use of Multispectral Ikonos Imagery for Discriminating between Conventional and Conservation Agricultural Tillage Practices,"Viña, Andrés; Peters, Albert J.; Ji, Lei",pp. 537-544(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000005/art00004;jsessionid=ic46fke8c7rh.x-ic-live-02,"There is a global concern about the increase in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. One method being discussed to encourage greenhouse gas mitigation efforts is based on a trading system whereby carbon emitters can buy effective mitigation efforts from farmers implementing conservation tillage practices. These practices sequester carbon from the atmosphere, and such a trading system would require a low-cost and accurate method of verification. Remote sensing technology can offer such a verification technique. This paper is focused on the use of standard image processing procedures applied to a multispectral Ikonos image, to determine whether it is possible to validate that farmers have complied with agreements to implement conservation tillage practices. A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed in order to isolate image variance in cropped fields. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) statistical procedures were used to evaluate the capability of each Ikonos band and each principal component to discriminate between conventional and conservation tillage practices. A logistic regression model was implemented on the principal component most effective in discriminating between conventional and conservation tillage, in order to produce a map of the probability of conventional tillage. The Ikonos imagery, in combination with ground-reference information, proved to be a useful tool for verification of conservation tillage practices."
Building and Evaluating Models to Estimate Ambient Population Density,"Sutton, Paul C.; Elvidge, Chris; Obremski, Tom",pp. 545-553(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000005/art00005;jsessionid=ic46fke8c7rh.x-ic-live-02,"The concept of human population density is quite simple: the number of persons occupying a given area. Nonetheless, practical representations of population density must use appropriate spatial and temporal scales of measurement to be useful. The 11 September 2001 attack on the World Trade Center in New York is a poignant example: “How many people were in the two World Trade Center buildings at 0830 local time?” Population density data derived from most-national censuses is a residential measure of population density and consequently does not capture non-residential population density. Human mobility suggests that a nonresidential or ambient measure of population density may be a more useful representation for some applications. Ambient population density in this sense is a temporally averaged measure of population density that takes into account where people work, sleep, eat, drive, shop, etc. Short of implanting a GPS reciever into everyone’s skull and tracking their spatio-temporal behavior, it is extremely difficult to make direct measurements of ambient population density. This paper explores some theoretical and empirical efforts at estimating ambient population density and proposes a quantitative means for evaluating their validity. The three models of population density examined are LandScan, Gridded Population of the World (GPW), and a simple empirical model derived from nighttime satellite imagery provided by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program’s Operational Linescan System (DMSP OLS). These measures are compared to both residential and employment-based measures of population density in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The GPW, LandScan, and DMSP OLS models of ambient population density described here all make foundational contributions to future efforts at filling the gap in social, economic, and demographic information for parts of the world where such data are unavailable. The proxy measures of population density described here show promise for many applications, including improved mapping of population distribution and as a supplement to census enumerations in many parts of the world."

To examine the spatial distribution of surface radiant temperatures, transects were drawn and analyzed from each temperature image. Moreover, the fractal dimensions of these transects were computed using the divider method, so that the spatial variability of surface radiant temperatures caused by the thermal behavior of different land-cover types and landscape pattern characteristics can be better understood. The effect of urban development on the geographical distribution of surface radiant temperatures and thus on the UHI was also investigated. The results revealed two major heat islands, one in the southwest and the other in the east of the city. The areal extent of the UHIs varied as the season changed. The transact derived from the spring image had the lowest fractal dimension while that from the summer image the highest value. Urban development increased the spatial variability of radiant temperatures, resulting in higher fractal dimension values. The thermal surfaces have become more spatially uneven and the textures more complex."
Image Calibration to Like-Values in Mapping Shallow Water Quality from Multitemporal Data,"Islam, Md A.; Gao, J.; Ahmad, W.; Neil, D.; Bell, P.",pp. 567-575(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000005/art00007;jsessionid=ic46fke8c7rh.x-ic-live-02,"The applicability of image calibration to like-values in mapping water quality parameters from multitemporal images is explored. Six sets of water samples were collected at satellite overpasses over Moreton Bay, Brisbane, Australia. Analysis of these samples reveals that waters in this shallow bay are mostly TSS-dominated, even though they are occasionally dominated by chlorophyll as well. Three of the images were calibrated to a reference image based on invariant targets. Predictive models constructed from the reference image were applied to estimating total suspended sediment (TSS) and Secchi depth from another image at a discrepancy of around 35 percent. Application of the predictive model for TSS concentration to another image acquired at a time of different water types resulted in a discrepancy of 152 percent. Therefore, image calibration to like-values could be used to reliably map certain water quality parameters from multitemporal TM images so long as the water type under study remains unchanged. This method is limited in that the mapped results could be rather inaccurate if the water type under study has changed considerably. Thus, the approach needs to be refined in shallow water from multitemporal satellite imagery."
Synergistic Fusion of GPS and Photogrammetrically Generated Elevation Models,"Mills, Jon P.; Buckley, Simon J.; Mitchell, Harvey L.",N/A,Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000004/art00001;jsessionid=1gq1mgkc7uu1v.x-ic-live-01,"Digital elevation models (DEMs) produced from photogrammetric data sources have long relied on the use of ground control points to give them scale and orientation. However, in areas such as coastlines, landslides, or glaciers, where identification of suitable natural features and pre-marking is difficult, the use of conventional ground control may be unfeasible. This paper reports on research that uses independently collectedDEMs derived from kinematicGPSto orient surfaces produced by aerial photogrammetric methods, using a least-squares surface matching algorithm. During algorithm development, three stages of testing were carried out, using increasingly more complex datasets. Initially, simulated surfaces were used to validate the matching theory and program. Then, aDEMderived from conventional aerial photography was matched with aGPSmodel, highlighting the effectiveness of surface matching to recover systematic errors in datasets. Finally, surfaces derived from small format digital imagery were successfully fused with wireframeGPSsurfaces, the high redundancy and automation potential creating an elegant and cheaper alternative to photocontrol."
Remote Sensing Texture Analysis Using Multi-Parameter and Multi-Scale Features,"Li, Yan; Peng, Jia-Xiong",pp. 351-355(5),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000004/art00002;jsessionid=1gq1mgkc7uu1v.x-ic-live-01,"A new multi-parameter and multi-scale (MPMS) feature set derived from fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is presented in this paper. Generally, natural textures can be modeled as fBm processes. Because fBm is characterized by a single Hurst parameter, it is not flexible enough to be used as the texture feature in classification. Therefore, an extended model is proposed, where the Hurst parameter H is no longer constant for all the scales. The shape and location of the estimation curve, when presented graphically, are fixed for a particular texture. We use the slopes of sections of the estimation curve to estimate the multi-scale Hurst parameters. Meanwhile, the unit displacement incremental power (UDIP) σ2is also taken as the parameter of the process. It determines the vertical placement of the curve in the graph. Experiments prove that theMPMSfeature set has advantages over some other features in the classification ofSPOTimages."

Three series of experiments have been prepared to test the performance of these methods in various classification contexts. These contexts are simulated by varying the number, type and visual likeness of the texture patches used in classification tests. More specifically, their ability to correctly classify, separate, and associate texture patches is assessed. Results suggest that the classification context has an important impact on performance rates of all methods. The variogram-based and the Gray-Tone Dependency Matrix methods were generally superior, each one in particular contexts"
Land-Use/Land-Cover Change Detection Using Improved Change-Vector Analysis,"Chen, Jin; Gong, Peng; He, Chunyang; Pu, Ruiliang; Shi, Peijun",pp. 369-379(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000004/art00004;jsessionid=1gq1mgkc7uu1v.x-ic-live-01,"Change-vector analysis (CVA) is a valuable technique for land-use/land-cover change detection. However, how to reasonably determine thresholds of change magnitude and change direction is a bottleneck to its proper application. In this paper, a new method is proposed to improveCVA. The method (the improvedCVA) consists of two stages, Double-Window Flexible Pace Search (DFPS), which aims at determining the threshold of change magnitude, and direction cosines of change vectors for determining change direction (category) that combines single-date image classification with a minimum-distance categorizing technique. When the improvedCVAwas applied to the detection of the land-use/land-cover changes in the Haidian District, Beijing, China, Kappa coefficients of “change/no-change” detection and “from-to” types of change detection were 0.87 and greater than 0.7, respectively, for all kinds of land-use changes. The experimental results indicate that the improvedCVAhas good potential in land-use/land-cover change detection."

Irrigation of landscape vegetation within urban environments represents a large portion of the total urban water consumption for this region. Current estimates suggest that up to 50 percent of residential water is used for landscape irrigation. This paper examines the utility of Ikonos multispectral satellite imagery and expert classifier approaches for quantifying the amount and distribution of urban irrigated landscape vegetation.A decision tree, expert classifier model applied to Ikonos image and land-useGISlayer inputs was tested against conven tional image classification approaches. With all branches of the decision tree activated, percentage estimates of urban irrigated vegetation versus impervious cover differed from airborne image-derived reference data by less than 8 percent. Highest agreement was achieved using all model branches except a spatial structure rule, which utilized a texture metric derived from Ikonos 1-m panchromatic data. For this same product, proportion estimates of two growth form types (Tree/Shrub and Grass) and impervious cover differed from reference data by less than 3 percent, and root-mean-square error (RMSE) values for all neighborhood-size sampling units were within 5 percent for all cover types. This “optimal” expert classifier product yielded areal proportion estimates andRMSEvalues that were approximately 2 percent closer to those of the reference data, compared to standard unsupervised classification applied to Ikonos multispectral data."

The experiment demonstrated the use of a thermal multispectral scanning imager, integrated on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a satellite uplink/downlink image data telemetry system, and near-real-time geo-rectification of the resultant imagery for data distribution via the Internet to disaster managers. The FiRE demonstration provided geo-corrected image data over a controlled burn to a fire management community in near-real-time by means of the melding of new technologies. The use of the UAV demonstrated remotely piloted flight (thereby reducing the potential for loss of human life during hazardous missions), and the ability to “linger and stare” over the fire for extended periods of time (beyond the capabilities of human-pilot endurance). Improvements in a high-temperature calibrated thermal imaging scanner allowed “remote” operations from a UAV and provided real-time accurate fire information collection over a controlled burn. Improved bit-rate capacity telemetry capabilities increased the amount, structure, and information content of the image data relayed to the ground. The integration of precision navigation instrumentation allowed improved accuracies in geo-rectification of the resultant imagery, easing data ingestion and overlay in a GIS framework. We present a discussion of the feasibility of utilizing new platforms, improved sensor configurations, improved telemetry, and new geo-correction software to facilitate wildfire management and mitigation strategies."

Existing surface reconstruction techniques cannot adequately extract canopy surfaces, especially for conifer stands. This paper develops an integrated model-based approach to reconstruct canopy surface for conifer stands analytically from the crown level. To deal with dense stands, critical problems are addressed in the process of model-based surface reconstruction. These include the occlusion problem in disparity (parallax) prediction from tree models, the edge effect of tree models on the disparity map, and the foreshortening effect in image matching. The model-based approach was applied to recover the canopy surface of a dense redwood stand using images scanned from 1:2,400-scale aerial photographs. Compared with field measurements, crown radius and tree height derived from the reconstructed canopy surface model have an overall accuracy of 92 percent and 94 percent, respectively. The results demonstrate the approach’s ability to reconstruct complicated stands."

Orthophoto production is usually based on digital elevation models (DEM); however, the elevations of 3D objects such as buildings and trees, which are visible in large-scale photos, are not included in DEMs. Recently initiated “true orthophoto” generation has been dedicated to urban scenes, removing the displacement caused by both the terrain and buildings. This paper reports an effort on reducing occlusion and distortion caused by trees in true orthoimage generation for forested areas. Canopy surface models (CSM) depicting both the terrain and tree surfaces were used in forest orthoimage production. Z-buffer techniques were incorporated into indirect orthoimage production to remove occlusion. An angle-based strategy was applied to composite multi-ocular images. The proposed techniques were applied in the generation of high-resolution orthoimages of a redwood stand with 1:2,400-scale aerial photos."

The system acquires first-return range and amplitude measurements at data rates up to 2000 hz (operator-controlled) and has an operational envelope up to 300 m above terrain. The airborne laser profiling system includes the laser transmitter/receiver, differential GPS receiver, a CCD video camera and recorder, and a laptop computer which interleaves and records the GPS and laser range/amplitude data. The portable airborne laser system (PALS) was designed to acquire forest height measurements along linear flight transects in order to conduct regional or subcontinental forest inventories worldwide.

The spatial methods were effective at characterizing the different logging feature treatments at both plot sizes; DTPSAand Moran’s I were most sensitive to fine-scale surface details. The spatial methods show potential for monitoring and management of logging activities over landscape scales. The importance of scale, given the ever-increasing choice of remotely sensed data, is emphasized."

Unrelated variance in the observed spectral response at mountain pine beetle field and aerial survey points was reduced following image stratification with the GIS forest inventory data and removal of other factors uncharacteristic of red-attack damage. Locations of known mountain pine beetle infestation were used to train a maximum-likelihood algorithm; overall classification accuracy was 73 percent, based on an assessment of 360 independent validation points.

Samples most often comprise clusters of pixels within homogeneous areas, thereby avoiding problems associated with accurately mapping “edges” (e.g., transition areas between two forest types). Consequently, they may well overestimate accuracy, but the degree of overestima tion is unknown. This paper examines two important factors regarding accuracy assessment that are not well studied: the effect on estimates of accuracy of (1) the sampling method and (2) the exact placement of the samples. Overall accuracy, normalized accuracy, and the KHAT statistic are computed from error matrices generated from simple random sampling, stra tified random sampling, and systematic sampling using totally random sample placement and samples chosen from homog eneous areas only. The results indicate that Kappa appears to be as appropriate to use with systematic sampling and stratified random sampling as it is with simple random sam pling, but suggests that sample placement may have more of an effect on estimates of accuracy than sampling method alone."

Data processing incorporated both spectral and GIS rule-based analytical techniques using multiple date SPOT 4 (XS), Landsat 7 (ETM+), and ancillary data sources. Unique LC classification elements included the identification of urban classes based on impervious surfaces and specific row crop type identifications. Individual pixels were aggregated to produce variable minimum mapping units or landscape “patches” corresponding to both riparian buffer zones (0.1 ha), and general watershed areas (0.4 ha). An accuracy assessment was performed using reference data derived fromin situfield measurements and imagery (camera) data. Multiple data interpretations were used to develop a reference database with known data variability to support a quantitative accuracy assessment of LC classification results. Confusion matrices were constructed to incorporate the variability of the reference data directly in the accuracy assessment process. Accuracies were reported for hierarchal classification levels with overall Level 1 classification accuracy of 82 percent (n = 825) for general watershed areas, and 73 percent (n = 391) for riparian buffer zone locations. A Kappa Test Z statistic of 3.3 indicated a significant difference between the two results. Classes that performed poorly were largely associated with the confusion of herbaceous classes with both urban and agricultural areas."

All of these retrieval parameters are effective, except for the weighting schemes, in retrieving the target objects. As a result, a majority of retrieval rates reach 60 percent to 90 percent."
Class-Guided Building Extraction from Ikonos Imagery,"Lee, D.

This paper addresses building extraction from Ikonos images in urban areas. The proposed approach uses the classification results of Ikonos multispectral images to provide approximate location and shape for candidate building objects. Their fine extraction is then carried out in the corresponding panchromatic image through segmentation and squaring. The ECHO classifier is used for supervised classification while the ISODATA algorithm is used for unsupervised classification and subsequent image segmentation. The classification performance is evaluated using the classification confusion matrix, while the final building extraction results are assessed based on the manually delineated results. A building squaring approach based on the Hough transformation is developed that detects and forms the rectilinear building boundaries. A number of sample results are presented to illustrate the approach and demonstrate its efficiency. It is shown that about 64.4 percent of the buildings can be detected, extracted, and accurately formed through this process. Remaining difficulties are high percentage false alarm errors caused by the misclassification of road and building classes as well as occlusion and shadows that may mislead the extraction process."

One of the means to realize this is by pose clustering. Based on vote accumulation, pose clustering can offer some advantages, such as reduced complexity and a false alarm rate prediction capability. This paper describes a voting scheme for right-angle flat-roof buildings, from which image space building location hypotheses (ISBLHs)may be efficiently generated for regularized urban areas. The proposed scheme incorporates weights, constraints, and uncertainties that should be implemented due to the nature of aerial imagery. Additionally, based on an occupancy model, a random vote accumulation and threshold analysis of the proposed voting scheme is presented. This scheme was tested on both simulated and real imagery, and the obtained results are discussed and analyzed."

This paper proposes a novel building extraction method developed from the concept of fitting CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) primitives to aerial images. To be practicable, this method adopts a semiautomatic procedure, carrying out high-level tasks (building detection, model selection, and attribution) interactively by the operator and performing optimal model-image fitting automatically with a least-squares fitting algorithm. Buildings, represented by CSG models, can be reconstructed part by part after fitting each parameterized CSG primitive to the edge pixels of aerial images. Reconstructed building parts can then be combined using CSG Boolean set operators. Consequently, a building is represented by a CSG tree in which each node links two branches of combined parts. This paper demonstrates ten examples of building extraction from aerial photos taken at a scale of 1:5,000 and scanned at a pixel size of 25 µm. All of the tests were performed in the prototypal system implemented in a CAD-based environment cooperated with a number of specially designed programs. The process time for each primitive is about 20 seconds and the successful rate of model-image fitting was about 90 percent. Evaluated with some check points, the fitting accuracy was about 0.3 m horizontally and 1 m vertically. The test results are encouraging and promote the theory of model-based building extraction."

The method, which we call “Split-Merge-Shape” (SMS), can treat both complete line segments as well as incomplete line segments due to image occlusions. The proposed method is comprised of five major parts: (1) the creation of the Region of Interest (ROI) and preprocessing, (2) splitting the model by using the 3D line segments to construct a combination of roof primitives, (3)merging connected roof primitives to complete the boundary of each building, (4) shaping each building rooftop by connected coplanar analysis and coplanar fitting, and (5) quality assurance. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can soundly rebuild the topology from the 3D line segments and reconstruct building models with up to a 98 percent success rate. The proposed SMS method has been proved reliable and effective, with a high degree of automation, even when groups of connected buildings or complex types of buildings are processed."
Automatic Matching and Three-Dimensional Reconstruction of Free-Form Linear Features from Stereo Images,"Habib, Ayman F.; Lee, Young-ran; Morgan, Michel",pp. 189-197(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000002/art00006;jsessionid=2icn9n1dxynuc.x-ic-live-03,"Automatic matching of free-formlinear features in overlapping large-scale imagery over urban areas still remains to be a problem in both the photogrammetric and computer vision communities. Although there is a variety of algorithms that have been developed to solve this problem, reliable results are not always guaranteed. Differences in illumination conditions, relief displacement, and occlusions are some of the factors that make solving the matching problem more challenging. The deficiency of available techniques stems from the fact that they do not consider the perspective geometry of the imaging system in the matching process. Moreover, it is usually assumed that conjugate entities are almost exact copies of each other (this is rarely the case). The need for a reliable algorithm that can handle large-scale imagery over urban areas is growing, especially with the increasing availability of high-resolution aerial imagery. In this research, a new approach for automatic matching and three-dimensional reconstruction of free-form linear features from stereo images is proposed. The suggested strategy is based on The Modified Iterated Hough Transform (MIHT) for Robust Parameter Estimation. MIHT relies on the mathematical relationship between conjugate entities (the coplanarity condition when dealing with a stereo pair). As a result, it overcomes problems arising from relief displacements and/or occlusions. Moreover, MIHT simultaneously solves for the relative orientation parameters as well as the correspondence between conjugate entities in a stereo pair. Matching ambiguities along and across conjugate epipolar lines are observed in the correspondence output from MIHT. Ambiguities along the epipolar lines stem from the nature of the coplanarity model, which establishes the correspondence between conjugate epipolar lines rather than conjugate points. On the other hand, ambiguities across the epipolar lines are expected due to the discrete cell size of the implemented accumulator array in MIHT. In this work, the ambiguities are resolved through several pruning techniques such as correlation coefficient, edge connectivity, height information, and epipolar geometry. Conjugate entities with sub-pixel accuracy are finally used to reconstruct accurate and reliable three-dimensional image-space discontinuities. Various experiments using large-scale imagery over urban areas proved the reliability and robustness of the proposed method."

Equations of space intersection with upward RF are derived. The computational experimental result with one-meter resolution Ikonos Geo stereo images and other airborne data verified the accuracy of the upward RF-based space intersection. We demonstrated different ways to improve the geopositioning accuracy of Ikonos Geo stereo imagery with ground control points by either refining the vendor-provided Ikonos RF coefficients or refining the RF-derived ground coordinates. The accuracy of 3D ground point determination was improved to 1 to 2 meters after the refinement. Finally, we showed the potential for recovering sensor models of a frame image and a linear array image from the RF."

The objectives of this study were to define the relationship between the final accuracy and the number and accuracy of input data, to track error propagation during the full geometric correction process (bundle adjustment and ortho-rectification), and to advise on the applicability of the model in operational environments.When ground control points (GCPs) have an accuracy poorer than 3 m, 20 GCPs over the entire image are a good compromise to obtain a 3- to 4-m accuracy in the bundle adjustment. When GCP accuracy is better than 1 m, ten GCPs are enough to decrease the bundle adjustment error of either panchromatic or multiband images to 2 to 3 m. Because GCP residuals reflect the input data errors (map and/or plotting), these errors did not propagate through the 3D parametric model, and the internal accuracy of the geometric model is thus better (around a pixel or less).Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of ortho-images were thus performed with either independent check points or overlaid digital vector files. Generally, the measured errors the predicted errors or were even slightly better, and a 2- to 4-m positioning accuracy was achieved for the ortho-images depending upon the elevation accuracy (DEM and grid spacing). To achieve a better final positioning accuracy, such as 1 m, a DEM with an accuracy of 1 to 2 m and with a fine grid spacing is required, in addition to well-defined GCPs with an accuracy of 1 m."

These biases, which are inherent in RPCs derived without the aid of ground control, give rise to geopositioning errors. The 3D positioning error can subsequently be compensated during spatial intersection by two additional parameters in image space that effect a translation of image coordinates. The resulting bias parameters can then be used to correct the RPCs supplied with Ikonos Geo imagery such that a practical means is provided for bias-free ground point determination, nominally to meter-level absolute accuracy, using entirely standard procedures on any photogrammetric workstation that supports Ikonos RPCs. The method requires provision of one or more ground control points. Aside from developing the bias compensation method, the paper also summarizes practical testing with bias-corrected RPCs that has demonstrated sub-meter geopositioning accuracy from Ikonos Geo imagery."

By incorporating a priori constraints into the adjustment model, multiple independent images can be adjusted with or without ground control. The RPC block adjustment model presented in this paper is directly related to geometric properties of the physical camera model. Multiple physical camera model parameters having the same net effect on the object-image relationship are replaced by a single adjustment parameter. Consequently, the proposed method is numerically more stable than the traditional adjustment of exterior and interior orientation parameters. This method is generally applicable to any photogrammetric camera with a narrow field of view, calibrated, stable interior orientation, and accurate a priori exterior orientation data. As demonstrated in the paper, for Ikonos satellite imagery, the RPC block adjustment achieves the same accuracy as the ground station block adjustment with the full physical camera model."
Development and Calibration of the Airborne Three-Line Scanner (TLS) Imaging System,"Chen, Tianen; Shibasaki, Ryosuke; Shunji, Murai",pp. 71-78(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000001/art00005;jsessionid=38u6strs0dcu0.x-ic-live-01,"The Airborne Three-Line-Scanner (TLS) imaging system has provided proof of the concept of stereo and multispectral mapping using the pushbroom mode because frame digital imaging systems with comparable coverage and resolution have not been available and are not likely to be available in the future. A prototype of the TLS system, the STARIMAGER, was developed jointly in 2000 by the STARLABO Corporation of Japan and the University of Tokyo and is introduced in this paper. A laboratory method and algorithm to evaluate the optical characteristics of STARIMAGER are presented. The principle is to measure the object-space angles of a sufficient number of CCD elements in two directions as seen through the optics. These angular measurements reflect the real camera geometry of both the optics and the CCD arrays. A mathematical model based on the central perspective projection has been constructed to estimate the focal length, principle point, and lens distortion of the optics and the alignment errors of the CCD sensors in the focal plane. These calibration parameters have been used in several real test flights, and ground point determination accuracies from 0.03- to 0.08-m (0.5- to 1.5-pixels) in planimetry and from 0.06- to 0.15-m (1.2-to 3-pixels) in elevation from a flying height of 500 m were attained."
An Algorithm for the Generation of Voronoi Diagrams on the Sphere Based on QTM,"Chen, Jun; Zhao, Xuesheng; Li, Zhilin",pp. 79-89(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000001/art00006;jsessionid=38u6strs0dcu0.x-ic-live-01,"In order to efficiently store and analyze spatial data on a global scale, the digital expression of Earth data in a data model must be global, continuous, and conjugate, i.e., a spherical dynamic data model is needed. The Voronoi data structure is the only published attempt (Wright and Goodchild, 1997) and the only possible solution currently available (Li et al., 1999) for a dynamic GIS. However, the complexity of the Voronoi algorithm for line sets and area sets in vector mode limits its application in a dynamic GIS. So far, there is no raster-based Voronoi algorithm for objects (including points, arcs, and regions) on a spherical surface.To overcome this serious deficiency, an algorithm for generating a spherical Voronoi diagram is presented, based on the O-QTM (Octahedral Quaternary Triangular Mesh). The principle of the dilation operation in mathematical morphology is extended to the spherical surface. Amethod is developed for a spherical distance transformation based on the QTM. A detailed algorithmis also presented. This algorithmcan handle points, arcs, and area features on a spherical surface. Tests have shown that the computational time consumption of this algorithm with points, arcs, and areas is equal and proportionate to the levels of the spherical surface tessellation; and the difference (distortion) between the great circle distance and the QTM cells distance is slightly related to spherical distance (not as the raster dilation on a planar surface), and is mainly related to the locations of the generating points."
Making the Trade-Off between Decision Quality and Information Cost,"de Bruin, S.; Hunter, Gary J.",pp. 91-98(8),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2003/00000069/00000001/art00007;jsessionid=38u6strs0dcu0.x-ic-live-01,"Agrowing problemconfronting users of remotely sensed imagery is whether the use of additional or different imagery to improve decision quality is actually justified by its cost. This paper discusses how to compare these competing factors so that an acceptable trade-off may be made between them. The proposed method is based on probabilistic cost-benefit analysis. The concept of “value of information” is introduced in a practical case study using remote sensing to verify farmers’ declarations for a crop subsidy program in the European Union. Application of the method requires that (1) the problem at hand can be represented by a decision tree, (2) the desirability of each decision outcome can be expressed numerically, (3) the imagery reveals information about the occurrence of events not under the decision maker‘s control, and (4) the probabilities of these events and the extent to which they are detectable in remotely sensed imagery can be assessed."
