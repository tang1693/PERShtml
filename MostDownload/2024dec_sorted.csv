The workflow generates models at different levels of detail (LoDs) to support data requirements of different applications from one consistent source. Specific attention has been paid to make the workflow robust to quickly run a new iteration in case of improvements in an algorithm or in case new input data become available. The quality of the reconstructed data highly depends on the quality of the input data and is monitored in several steps of the process. A 3D viewer has been developed to view and download the openly available 3D data at different LoDs in different formats. The workflow has been applied to all 10 million buildings of the Netherlands. The 3D service will be updated after new input data becomes available.","Peters, Ravi, Dukai, Balázs, Vitalis, Stelios, van Liempt, Jordi, Stoter, Jantien",,,https://doi.org/10.14358/pers.21-00032r2

Seagrass is vital for many species in the lagoon, but nutrient overloading, algal blooms, boating, manatee grazing, and other factors have led to its loss. To understand this decline, a deep neural network analyzed Landsat imagery from 2000 to 2020. Results showed significant seagrass loss post-2013, coinciding with the 2011–2013 super algal bloom. Seagrass abundance varied annually, with the model performing best in years with higher seagrass coverage. While the deep learning method successfully identified seagrass, it also revealed that recent seagrass coverage is almost non-existent. This monitoring approach could aid in ecosystem recovery if coupled with appropriate policies for Mosquito Lagoon's restoration.","Insalaco, Stephanie A., Herrero, Hannah V., Limber, Russ, Oliver, Clancy, Wolfson, William B.",,,https://doi.org/10.14358/pers.24-00001r2

The recently launched, new generation spaceborne hyperspectral sensors, German DLR Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer (DESIS) and Italian PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA), provide unprecedented data in hundreds of narrow spectral bands for the study of the Earth. Therefore, our overarching goal in this study was to use these data to explore advances that can be made in agricultural research. We selected PRISMA and DESIS images during the 2020 growing season in California's Central Valley to study seven major crops. PRISMA and DESIS images were highly correlated (R 2of 0.9–0.95). Out of the 235 DESIS bands (400–1000 nm) and 238 PRISMA bands (400–2500 nm), 26 (11%) and 45 (19%) bands, respectively, were optimal to study agricultural crops. These optimal bands provided crop type classification accuracies of 83–90%. Hyperspectral vegetation indices to estimate plant pigment content, stress, biomass, moisture, and cellulose/lignin content were also identified.","Aneece, Itiya, Thenkabail, Prasad S.",,,https://doi.org/10.14358/pers.22-00039r2

This article presents novel approaches, including feature-based cross-view image matching and the integration of visual odometry and photogrammetric space resection for camera pose determination in real-time. Experimental evaluation with real UAV datasets demonstrated that the proposed method reliably matches features in cross-view images with large differences in spatial resolution, coverage, and perspective views, achieving a root-mean-square error of 4.7 m for absolute position error and 0.33° for rotation error, and delivering real-time performance of 12 frames per second (FPS) when implemented in a lightweight edge device onboard UAV.

Therefore alternative solutions have been sought that are both cost-effective and suitable for nonprofessional use. A review of the literature shows that researchers primarily use GoPro action cameras, while other action cameras with similar capabilities are rarely used. This study thus examines underwater photogrammetry methods using a widely recognized action camera as a reference and compares it with another camera of similar characteristics as a potential alternative. For a comprehensive temporal analysis in underwater studies, both cameras were used to capture photographic and video imagery, and the resulting 3D point clouds were compared. Comparison criteria included data collection and processing times, point cloud densities, cloud-to-cloud analysis, and assessments of surface density and roughness. Having analysed, the study concluded that the proposed alternative action camera can feasibly be used in underwater photogrammetry.","Hamal, Seda Nur Gamze, Ulvi, Ali",,,https://doi.org/10.14358/pers.23-00042r2

Diverse geological processes generate irregular alteration patterns with diverse spectral characteristics in mineral deposits. Applying remotely sensed hyperspectral images (HSIs) is an appealing technology for geologic surveyors to generate alteration maps. Conventional methods mainly use shallow spectral absorption features to discriminate minerals and cannot extract their important spectral information. Deep neural networks with nonlinear layers can evoke the deep spectral and spatial information of HSIs. Deep learning???based methods include fully connected neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and hybrid convolutional networks like mixed convolution neural network and covariance pooling (MCNN‐CP) algorithms. However, each has its advantages and limitations. To significantly avoid losing important spectral features, we proposed a new method by fusing a one‐dimensional convolutional neural network (1D‐CNN) with MCNN‐CP (1D‐MCNN‐CP), achieving an overall accuracy (97.44%) of mineral mapping from PRISMA HSIs. This research deduced that 1D‐MCNN‐CP improved performance and reduced misclassification errors among minerals sharing similar spectral features.","Peyghambari, Sima, Zhang, Yun, Heidarian, Hassan, Sekandari, Milad",,,https://doi.org/10.14358/pers.24-00006r2

The method enables us to fill nearshore data voids in existing Kd data sets and provides a more direct measurement approach than methods based on passive multispectral satellite imagery. Furthermore, in contrast to other lidar-based methods, it does not rely on extensive signal processing or the availability of the system impulse response function, and it is designed to be applied globally rather than at a specific geographic location. The model was tested using Kd measurements from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite sensor at 94 coastal sites spanning the globe, with Kd values ranging from 0.05 to 3.6 m –1 . The results demonstrate the efficacy of the approach and serve as a benchmark for future machine-learning regression studies of turbidity usingICESat-2.","Corcoran, Forrest, Parrish, Christopher E.",,,https://doi.org/10.14358/pers.21-00013r2

In this method, roofs are first extracted from UAV images using a depth-channel improved UNet model. A two-step change detection scheme is then implemented for PIC detection. In the change detection stage, roofs with appearance, disappearance, and shape changes are first extracted by morphological analysis. Subroof primitives are then obtained by roof-constrained image segmentation within the remaining roof areas, and object-based iteratively reweighted multivariate alteration detection (IR-MAD ) is implemented to extract the small PICs from the subroof primitives. The proposed method organically combines deep learning and object-based image analysis, which can identify entire roof changes and locate small object changes within the roofs. Experiments show that the proposed method has better accuracy compared with the other counterparts, including the original IR-MAD, change vector analysis, and principal components analysis-K-means.","Liu, Yang, Sun, Yujie, Tao, Shikang, Wang, Min, Shen, Qian, Huang, Jiru",,,https://doi.org/10.14358/pers.87.4.263

Compared with existing road marking extraction methods, not only can extract HMs in presence of wear and occlusion from point clouds, but we also perform a degradation analysis for HMs. First, the HMs candidate area is determined accurately by sophisticated image processing. Second, the prior knowledge of marking design rules and edge-based matching model that leverages the standard geometric template and radiometric appearance of HMs is used for accurately extracting and reconstructing solid lines and nonsolid markings of HMs, respectively.
