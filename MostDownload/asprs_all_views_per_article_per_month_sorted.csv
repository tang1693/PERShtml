2024/09,An Integrated Approach for Landslide Susceptibility Mapping Using Remote Sensing and GIS,Article,10.14358/pers.70.5.617,Photogrammetric Engineering & Remote Sensing,Journal,,0099-1112,,,,2004,70.0,5.0,45,45,0,45,0,0,0,45,0,316,316,0,American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing,,"A methodology for landslide susceptibility mapping using an integrated remote sensing and GIS approach is presented. A part of the Darjeeling Himalaya was selected for the model execution. IRS satellite data, topographic maps, field data, and other informative maps were used as inputs to the study. Important terrain factors, contributing to landslide occurrences in the region, were identified and corresponding thematic data layers were generated. These data layers represent the geological, topographical, and hydrological conditions of the terrain. A numerical rating scheme for the factors was developed for spatial data analysis in a GIS. The resulting landslide susceptibility map delineates the area into different zones of four relative susceptibility classes: high, moderate, low, and very low. The susceptibility map was validated by correlating the landslide frequencies of different classes. This has shown a close agreement with the existing field instability condition. The effectiveness of the map was also confirmed by the high statistically significant value of a chi-square test.","Sarkar, S., Kanungo, D.P.",,,https://doi.org/10.14358/pers.70.5.617

Individual tree segmentations, usually derived from the canopy height model, are used to derive individual tree structural attributes such as tree height, crown diameter, canopy-based height, and others. In this study, we develop a new algorithm to segment individual trees from the small footprint discrete return airborne lidar point cloud. We experimentally applied the new algorithm to segment trees in a mixed conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California. The results were evaluated in terms of recall, precision, and F-score, and show that the algorithm detected 86 percent of the trees (“recall”), 94 percent of the segmented trees were correct (“precision”), and the overall F-score is 0.9. Our results indicate that the proposed algorithm has good potential in segmenting individual trees in mixed conifer stands of similar structure using small footprint, discrete return lidar data.","Li, Wenkai, Guo, Qinghua, Jakubowski, Marek K., Kelly, Maggi",,,https://doi.org/10.14358/pers.78.1.75

Recent and planned launches of satellites with improved spectral and spatial resolution sensors should lead to greater use of remote sensing techniques to assess and monitor water quality parameters. Integration of remotely sensed data, GPS, and GIS technologies provides a valuable tool for monitoring and assessing waterways. Remotely sensed data can be used to create a permanent geographically located database to provide a baseline for future comparisons.

ThisPE&RSSpecial Issue provides an update to the 1997 25th Landsat anniversary issue, particularly focused on the contribution of Landsat-7 to the 34+year history of the Landsat mission. In this overview paper, we place the Landsat-7 system in context and show how mission operations have changed over time, increasingly exploiting the global monitoring capabilities of the Landsat observatory. Although considerable progress was made during the Landsat-7 era, there is much yet to learn about the historical record of Landsat global coverage: a truly valuable national treasure.

However, two major problems have been often encountered: (a) NDWIs calculated from different band combinations [visible, near-infrared, or shortwave-infrared (SWIR)] can generate different results, and (b) NDWI thresholds vary depending on the proportions of subpixel water/non-water components. We need to evaluate all the NDWIs for determining the best performing index and to establish appropriate thresholds for clearly identifying water features. We used the spectral data obtained from a spectral library to simulate the satellite sensors Landsat ETM+, SPOT-5, ASTER, and MODIS, and calculated the simulated NDWI in different forms. We found that the NDWI calculated from (green – SWIR)/(green + SWIR), where SWIR is the shorter wavelength region (1.2 to 1.8 mm), has the most stable threshold. We recommend this NDWI be employed for mapping water, but adjustment of the threshold based on actual situations is necessary.","Ji, Lei, Zhang, Li, Wylie, Bruce",,,https://doi.org/10.14358/pers.75.11.1307

Lidar processing techniques included data fusion with multispectral optical data and local filtering with both square and circular windows of variable size. The lidar system used for this study produced an average footprint of 0.65 m and an average distance between laser shots of 0.7 m. The lidar data set was acquired over deciduous and coniferous stands with settings typical of the southeastern United States. The lidar-derived tree measurements were used with regression models and cross-validation to estimate tree height on 0.017-ha plots. For the pine plots, lidar measurements explained 97 percent of the variance associated with the mean height of dominant trees. For deciduous plots, regression models explained 79 percent of the mean height variance for dominant trees. Filtering for local maximum with circular windows gave better fitting models for pines, while for deciduous trees, filtering with square windows provided a slightly better model fit. Using lidar and optical data fusion to differentiate between forest types provided better results for estimating average plot height for pines. Estimating tree height for deciduous plots gave superior results without calibrating the search window size based on forest type.","Popescu, Sorin C., Wynne, Randolph H.",,,https://doi.org/10.14358/pers.70.5.589

First is the cost-free increase of overlap between images when sensing digitally. Second is an improved radiometry. Third is multi-view matching. Fourth is the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), making complex algorithms for image matching very practical. These innovations lead to improved automation of the photogrammetric workflow so that point clouds are created at sub-pixel accuracy, at very dense intervals, and in near real-time, thereby eroding the unique selling proposition of lidar scanners.Two test projects compare point clouds from aerial and street-side lidar systems with those created from images. We show that the photogrammetric accuracy compares well with the lidar-method, yet the density of surface points is much higher from images, and the throughput is commensurate with a fully automated all-digital approach. Beyond this density, we identify 15 additional advantages of the photogrammetric approach.","Leberl, F., Irschara, A., Pock, T., Meixner, P., Gruber, M., Scholz, S., Wiechert, A.",,,https://doi.org/10.14358/pers.76.10.1123

The National Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture conducts field interviews with sampled farm operators and obtains crop cuttings to make crop yield estimates at regional and state levels. NASS needs supplemental spatial data that provides timely information on crop condition and potential yields. In this research, the crop model EPIC (Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator) was adapted for simulations at regional scales. Satellite remotely sensed data provide a real-time assessment of the magnitude and variation of crop condition parameters, and this study investigates the use of these parameters as an input to a crop growth model. This investigation was conducted in the semi-arid region of North Dakota in the southeastern part of the state. The primary objective was to evaluate a method of integrating parameters retrieved from satellite imagery in a crop growth model to simulate spring wheat yields at the sub-county and county levels. The input parameters derived from remotely sensed data provided spatial integrity, as well as a real-time calibration of model simulated parameters during the season, to ensure that the modeled and observed conditions agree. A radiative transfer model, SAIL (Scattered by Arbitrary Inclined Leaves), provided the link between the satellite data and crop model. The model parameters were simulated in a geographic information system grid, which was the platform for aggregating yields at local and regional scales. A model calibration was performed to initialize the model parameters. This calibration was performed using Landsat data over three southeast counties in North Dakota. The model was then used to simulate crop yields for the state of North Dakota with inputs derived from NOAA AVHRR data. The calibration and the state level simulations are compared with spring wheat yields reported by NASS objective yield surveys.","Doraiswamy, Paul C., Moulin, Sophie, Cook, Paul W., Stern, Alan",,,https://doi.org/10.14358/pers.69.6.665

Random forest is a non-parametric ensemble approach, and unlike traditional regression approaches there is no direct quantification of prediction error. Understanding prediction uncertainty is important when using model-based continuous maps as inputs to other modeling applications such as fire modeling. Here we use a Monte Carlo approach to quantify prediction uncertainty for random forest regression models. We test the approach by simulating maps of dependent and independent variables with known characteristics and comparing actual errors with prediction errors. Our approach produced conservative prediction intervals across most of the range of predicted values. However, because the Monte Carlo approach was data driven, prediction intervals were either too wide or too narrow in sparse parts of the prediction distribution. Overall, our approach provides reasonable estimates of prediction uncertainty for random forest regression models.","Coulston, John W., Blinn, Christine E., Thomas, Valerie A., Wynne, Randolph H.",,,https://doi.org/10.14358/pers.82.3.189

A modular toolbox consisting of digital cameras, computer interfaces, illumination systems, calibration devices, combined with subpixel accuracy image measurement operators, multi-image matching techniques, and self-calibrating bundle adjustment in a suitable user interface, depicts a very powerful tool for tailoring custom-made solutions for material testing labs. Due to the wide range and the repetitive nature of measurements tasks in civil engineering, these applications could depict a significant future market for photogrammetry.This paper will briefly discuss the major hardware and software modules of a toolbox for civil engineering material testing and large structure monitoring. Based on several sample applications covering object dimensions from 10 cm to 500 meters, the potential of photogrammetric deformation measurement techniques will be shown. The major advantage of photogrammetric techniques can often be seen in the fact that they allow for highly automated measurements at a large number of points simultaneously.

Raster processes are more commonly used because they can be significantly faster computationally than vector, but error is introduced in converting vector data to raster. This conversion error has been widely studied and quantified, but the impact on environmental assessment results has not been investigated. We examined four GIS-based measurements commonly used in environmental assessments for approximately 1000 watersheds in the state of Maryland and Washington, D.C. Each metric was calculated using vector and raster methods, and estimated values were compared using a paired t-test, Spearman rank correlation, and cluster analyses. Paired t-tests were used to determine the statistical significance of quantitative differences between methods, and Spearman rank correlation and cluster analyses were used to evaluate the impact of the differences on environmental assessments. Paired t-test results indicated significant quantitative differences between methods for three of the four metrics. However, Spearman ranks and cluster analyses indicated that the quantitative differences would not affect environmental assessment results. Spearman rank correlations between vector and raster values were greater than 0.98 for all comparisons. Cluster analyses resulted in identical assignment for 88 percent to over 98 percent of watersheds analyzed among vector and various raster methods.","Wade, Timothy G., Wickham, James D., Nash, Maliha S., Neale, Anne C., Riitters, Kurt H., Jones, K.

Dramatic changes in land use and land cover have occurred, with loss of forest and cropland to urban use. In particular, low-density urban use, which includes largely residential use, has increased by over 119 percent between 1973 and 1997. These land-use and land-cover changes have drastically altered the land surface characteristics. An analysis of Landsat images revealed an increase in surface temperature and a decline in NDVI from 1973 to 1997. These changes have forced the development of a significant urban heat island effect at both the urban canopy and urban boundary layers as well as an increase in ground level ozone production to such an extent that Atlanta has violated EPA’s ozone level standard in recent years. Using canonical correlation analysis, surface temperatures and NDVI, extracted from Landsat TM images, were found to correlate strongly with volatile organic compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, the two ingredients that form ozone by reacting with sunlight, but only weakly with the rates of cardiovascular and chronic lower respiratory diseases, which also did not exhibit strong correlation with VOC and NOx emissions, possibly because other factors such as demographic and socio-economic may also be involved. Further research is therefore needed to understand the health geography and its relationship to land-use and land-cover change.
