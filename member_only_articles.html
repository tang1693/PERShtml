            Due to the complementary characteristics of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical images, image registration as a prerequisite for their information fusion has received increasing attention. Currently, learning-based methods can better handle the significant radiometric and geometric differences between optical and SAR images compared to traditional registration approaches, but they still have limitations in distinguishing difficult samples, making high-precision registration a remaining challenge. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-level feature collaborative matching network (MFC-Net) that effectively integrates high-level abstract features and low-level spatial features for precise registration. Furthermore, a novel dual-dimension joint attention module (DDJA) is designed to dynamically capture feature dependencies across both channel and spatial dimensions, enhancing cross-modal feature consistency and improving matching performance. Additionally, to address the problem of similarity between hard positive and negative samples caused by high-precision registration requirements, a dynamic differentiation factor is introduced at the loss function level, enabling the model to better distinguish between these similar samples in training. Extensive experiments conducted on the WHU-OPT-SAR data set and WHU-SENCity data set demonstrate that the proposed MFC-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both matching accuracy and precision, validating its superiority in cross-modal image registration tasks.

            In response to the challenges of dense target distribution, significant scale variations, and limited feature information for small objects in remote sensing images, this paper introduces a multi-scale fusion network with enhanced target features. Initially, a multi-layer feature aggregation module is constructed within the backbone network to enhance the capability of feature extraction. Subsequently, a multi-channel feature fusion module is implemented in the neck portion of the network to effectively capture cross-channel information and further enhance the expressive power of features at different scales. Moreover, a bi-directional multi-scale feature fusion module is proposed as a mechanism for feature fusion, using top-down and bottom-up fusion strategies to facilitate information interaction among features at different levels. Finally, in the detection layer, a fractional Fourier transform is applied to the image to extract additional feature information, which, combined with convolutional operations, improves the accuracy of small object detection. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments were conducted on the data set for object detection in aerial images and Northwestern Polytechnical University very high resolution 10 data sets. The average detection accuracy achieved was 78.7% and 95.4%, respectively. Computational complexity was measured at 95.6 G, and the overall model size was 30.7 M. These results demonstrate that the proposed method excels at high detection accuracy, low computational complexity, and strong feature representation capability. It effectively improves the detection accuracy of small objects in remote sensing images, thereby enhancing the overall performance of small object detection in remote sensing imagery.

            This paper presents a methodology for thermal infrared (TIR) point cloud acquisition, leveraging information from the visible camera, TIR camera, and their respective unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) position and their position and orientation systems (POSs) prior. First, the visible images and their corresponding UAV POS information are used to generate a red–green–blue (RGB) dense point cloud with geographic coordinates; subsequently, using the RGB dense point cloud as a reference, the acquisition of a calibration parameter between global navigation satellite system/inertial measurement unit and the TIR camera is conducted using the POS information corresponding to the selected TIR images; finally, a TIR point cloud of the entire survey area is generated based on the calibration parameters. The availability and suitability of the fused TIR point cloud generated and UAV POS data are also evaluated in terms of localization deviations and orientation deviations. The experimental results demonstrate that the acquisition of coarse quality TIR point cloud can be achieved by using a priori POS data provided by different small UAVs. The TIR point cloud generated by the UAV POS data guidance can be directly applied to medium and large-sized buildings. The POS guided projected images achieved an 86.67% registration success rate with the TIR images, indicating that the orientation deviations are within acceptable limits and establishing a solid foundation for subsequent fine fusion.

            Novel Spatiotemporal ConvLSTM-Based Cellular Automata Model for Simulating Urban Expansion

            Accurately capturing and simulating the spatiotemporal dynamics of urban expansion remains a persistent challenge in urban planning and environmental management. Traditional machine learning methods often struggle to capture the complexity of spatial features and the multi-scale spatiotemporal dynamics involved in deriving the transition rules of cellular automata (CA), making it difficult to balance detailed local expansion with broader overall trends during the urban expansion simulation process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel spatiotemporal CA model based on the convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) neural network. This model, termed ST-ConvLSTM-CA, simultaneously enhances critical spatial features and incorporates multi-scale spatiotemporal features by integrating the shuffle attention mechanism and a spatiotemporal expression (SE) block into the ConvLSTM architecture. First, the channel dimensions of spatial features are grouped and channel spatial attention is performed in parallel, allowing for efficient fusion and weighting of key spatial features with minimal computational cost. Second, the SE module is used to integrate the multi-scale information within ConvLSTM cells, enhancing the representation of neighborhood details across different spatial granularities and capturing dynamic temporal features. Finally, the improved model generates conversion probability maps, which are used by the CA model to simulate time series urban expansion maps. Using the urban agglomerations of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the Yangtze River Delta, and Beijing-Tianjing-Tangshan as case studies, results show that ST-ConvLSTM-CA achieves the highest accuracy across all three regions. This demonstrates its robust adaptability to complex spatiotemporal data and superior predictive performance.

            Applications of remote sensing images in both defense and civilian sectors have spurred substantial research interest. In the field of remote sensing, object detection confronts challenges such as complex backgrounds, scale diversity, and the presence of dense small objects. To address these issues, we propose an improved deep learning-based model, the Global Multi-scale Fusion Self-calibration Network, which is expected to contribute to alleviating the challenges. It consists of three main components: the hierarchical feature aggregation backbone, which uses improved modules such as the receptive field context-aware feature extraction module, the global information acquisition module, and the simple parameter-free attention module to extract key features and minimize the background interference. To couple multi-scale features, we enhanced the fusing component and designed the multi-scale enhanced pyramid structure integrating the proposed new modules. During the detection phase, especially when focusing on small object detection, we designed a novel convolutional attention feature fusion head. This head is constructed to integrate local and global branches for feature extraction by leveraging channel shuffling and multi-head attention mechanisms for efficient and accurate detection. Experiments on the Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images (DIOR), Northwestern Polytechnical University Very High-Resolution‐10 (NWPU VHR‐10), remote sensing object detection (RSOD), and DOTAv1.0 data sets show that our method achieves mAP50(mean average precision at 50% intersection over union) of 69.7%, 91.3%, 94.2%, and 70.0%, respectively, outperforming existing comparative methods. The proposed network is expected to provide new perspectives for remote sensing tasks and possible solutions for relevant applications in the image domain.

            Accurate deformation measurement of building materials has consistently been a focal point of research within the field of material testing. This paper proposes a robust 3D crack parameter estimation approach to measure the crack propagation characteristics of concrete pillars under compression testing. Through the use of an improved multiple-window matching strategy and other advanced image processing algorithms, the precise positional information of speckle target points can be calculated in speckle image sequences. 3D point cloud data and full-field deformation of target points on the concrete pillar surface can be further calculated through photogrammetric analysis and spatiotemporal analysis, respectively. Finally, a robust crack estimation algorithm based on grid geometry analysis is proposed to extract accurate crack parameters in the presence of complex speckle texture interference. To verify the superiority and reliability of the proposed approach, both a simulation test and an empirical test were conducted. The experimental results, including positional comparisons with previous matching strategies and displacement comparisons with third-party equipment, corroborate the effectiveness of our method.

            Ship target detection is a critical component for marine environmental monitoring and the protection of maritime rights and interests. However, existing methods for ship detection in remote sensing imagery often face challenges such as false positives and missed detections, particularly in the presence of complex backgrounds and multi-scale targets. To address these issues, we propose a novel method called LFSA‐YOLOv7, (LDConv {Linear Deformable Convolution}; SPPFCSPC‐G {Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fast Cross Stage Partial Channel ‐ Group}, SimAM{Simple Attention Module}, and Alpha‐CoIoU {Alpha‐Coordinate Point Orienta tion ‐ Intersection over Union}) which is designed to enhance the accuracy and robustness of ship detection in complex backgrounds: (a) a novel network architecture (LDConv + SPPFCSPC‐G + SimAM) to enhance the model’s ship detection capabilities, and (b) a novel Alpha‐CoIoU loss function to improve the model’s ship localization accuracy. To evaluate the performance of our algorithm in complex backgrounds, we have developed a novel ship classification detection (SCD) data set and conducted comprehensive experiments. Furthermore, we have validated the generalization of our algorithm across various remote sensing ship data sets. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms previous techniques, exhibiting strong generalization and robustness, making it effectively suitable for ship detection in complex backgrounds. The SCD data set and code will be available at https://github.com/wionn/LFSA-YOLOv7.git.

            Video synthetic aperture radar (SAR) target detection has seen rapid development in recent years, but current methods generally suffer from high computational complexity as well as frequent false alarms and missed alarms. Additionally, in video SAR scenarios, small targets become more difficult to identify due to low resolution and complex backgrounds. Recently, leveraging shadows for video SAR moving target detection has proven advantageous as it provides accurate location information and additional boundary details. To address the challenges of target detection in video SAR caused by low resolution and complex backgrounds, as well as the high computational cost of current methods, this paper proposes a lightweight algorithm for video SAR shadow detection based on the YOLOv5 architecture, named Lavs-DeNet. First, a lightweight feature extraction backbone network combining both global and local information called CGLLNet is proposed. This backbone improves the detection performance by mitigating false alarms and missed alarms caused by defocus in video SAR images. Next, a slanted ladder bidirectional feature pyramid network (SL‐BiFPN) is designed. By using tilted upsampling with multiple stacked layers, this network efficiently extracts multi-scale features, further reducing missed alarms. Finally, a lightweight information interaction module (LII‐C3) has been developed, significantly reducing computational complexity. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments were conducted using the data set released by Sandia National Laboratories. The experimental results show that the proposed Lavs-DeNet can achieve 97.88% detection accuracy, requiring only 21.02G floating points and 0.88M parameters, which is superior to the current classical video SAR target detection networks.

            The significance of hyperspectral image classification lies in its ability to discern subtle differences between materials, making it essential in fields such as agriculture, mineral exploration, and urban planning. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer-based methods have become standard for hyperspectral imagery classification, with hybrid approaches gaining popularity. Yet, these methods often lack efficient interaction between the features extracted by CNNs and transformers. To address this, we propose the hierarchical multiscale cross interaction network (HMCI-Net), which leverages both CNNs and transformers to enhance classification accuracy. The CNN branch extracts local spatial-spectral features, and the transformer branch captures global spectral information, allowing the network to model long-range dependencies and complex correlations. Additionally, HMCI-Net incorporates a hierarchical multi-scale feature extraction module and a multi-view feature fusion module, further improving its ability to extract fine-grained, multi-perspective features. Extensive experiments on four benchmark hyperspectral data sets—Indian Pines, Pavia University, WHU-Hi-LongKou, and Houston2013—demonstrate that HMCI-Net outperforms existing methods, achieving an average improvement of 6.24% in average accuracy, 6.14% in kappa coefficient, and 5.55% in overall accuracy. Specifically, HMCI-Net achieves significant gains, with overall accuracy higher by 8.86%, 4.34%, 4.44%, and 4.42% on Indian Pines, Pavia University, WHU-HiLongKou, and Houston2013, respectively. Similarly, average accuracy is higher by 10.57%, 4.94%, 5.65%, and 4.81% for Indian Pines, Pavia University, WHU-Hi-LongKou, and Houston2013, respectively; kappa coefficient is higher by 10.39%, 4.88%, 4.70%, and 4.60%, respectively, on these data sets.

            India yearly experiences natural disasters such as floods, droughts, cyclones, and landslides, which not only disrupt but also significantly affect the socioeconomic activities of its people. Darjeeling, one of the most valuable districts of West Bengal, India, is located in the foothills of the mighty Himalayas. Landslides in Darjeeling, particularly during the monsoon season, severely affect the socioeconomic conditions of the local population. This research creates a landslide susceptibility map of Darjeeling using the frequency ratio model (FRM) and geographical weighted regression (GWR). The study considers 16 landslide-conditioning factors and 743 past landslide events, of which 70% are used for modeling and the remaining 30% are used for validation. The generated landslide susceptibility map categorizes the area into very low, low, moderate, high, and very high susceptibility zones. Results show that most of the study area falls within the high susceptibility zone, covering approximately 28.45% of the region. The study also reveals that the northern hilly regions of the district are more prone to landslides compared with the southern part, based on FRM and GWR. The area under curve indicates that the model achieved a 74.7% success rate. The highest value of the landslide density index was found in areas classified as having very high landslide susceptibility. Therefore, considering the landslide susceptibility, implementation of effective management strategies is essential for ensuring the future development of the district.

Vaccination policies, movement restrictions, and mask mandates were critical in reducing cases per million, while testing, public information, income support, and contact tracing were crucial for lowering the viral reproduction rate. Vaccination policies did not significantly affect the reproduction rate during implementation. The gender of leaders showed no significant effect on cases, deaths, or excess mortality, though female leaders generally implemented fewer isolation days and prioritized additional measures like movement restrictions and stay-at-home orders.

            Disease surveillance, including risk modeling, is beneficial for infectious diseases. Risk prediction maps can be used to prioritize areas to deliver vaccines reducing disease transmission. For zoonotic infectious diseases such as Lyme disease, potential vaccine deployment areas include cost-effective places key to vectors, wildlife hosts, and humans. This paper uses machine-learning techniques to develop models to predict Lyme disease risk, then uses the critical variables within the models, as well those considered principal from previous literature, to create a Lyme disease risk map and to prioritize areas for wildlife vaccine deployment. It was found that highest disease risk is in the eastern United States, especially the upper Midwest and Northeast regions, which coincides with previous literature. The study found national parks and counties within these areas to prioritize wildlife vaccine deployment. Future work includes ground-truthing of the risk map and dispersal of vaccine to priority areas.

            Rapid urbanization and population growth have intensified the need for accurate and efficient identification of residential buildings in urban planning and disaster management. This paper presents a novel approach for identifying residential buildings by leveraging multiple source data and a transfer learning model, with a case study conducted in Galveston Island, Texas. We propose an integrated framework that combines very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery, lidar data, points of interest (POI) data, and GIS-based land use information to extract features of residential buildings. We fine-tune a pretrained deep learning model with our data sets to enhance the model’s adaptability and efficiency in detecting residential buildings in the study area. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high accuracy in identifying residential buildings, with overall accuracy of 85.6% in the case study. This study also offers valuable insights into the potential of combining multiple data sources and transfer learning techniques for improving residential building identification and other related tasks in urban remote sensing applications.

            Texture-Semantic Point: Registration for Point Clouds of Porcelain Relics

            Point cloud models of porcelain are captured through the multi-registration of point clouds, which presents a challenging task. On the one hand, the smooth surface of porcelain lacks geometric feature variation, making it difficult to establish corresponding points. On the other hand, the overall geometric symmetry of most porcelain relics can easily lead to iterative calculations falling into the local minimum convergence trap. To address the difficulties in feature point selection, we propose a novel approach using texture-semantic points as features for coarse registration. We first select rich texture points as 2D candidates and establish a 2D-3D matching relationship, giving each candidate its 3D spatial location and associated texture information. Using these correspondences, we perform coarse alignment of the point clouds. However, in reality, the point clouds are not aligned, and the registration calculation fails because of geometric symmetry issues. To address this, we integrate a control net into the iterative closest point (ICP) calculation to guide iterations towards the correct Special Euclidean group in 3 dimensions (SE(3)) transformation, achieving refined alignment. Finally, considering porcelain's symmetrical geometry, we introduce a pose optimization constraint using the symmetry axis as a weighted parameter to limit degrees of freedom and enhance registration accuracy. Experiments were conducted on seven porcelain datasets to evaluate the proposed approach. A qualitative analysis demonstrated successful refined alignment using the proposed approach. In addition, we performed a quantitative comparison with state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results showed that our approach outperformed others across all models when applied to the registration of geometrically symmetric porcelain; Specifically, the proposed method achieved a 50% enhancement in accuracy compared with others, measured by the distance between the labeled corresponding points.

            The geometric calibration accuracy of the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) system is affected by the extraction accuracy of Corner Reflector (CR) points in a Single-Look Complex (SLC) image. There are some problems in traditional artificial extraction methods for CR points, such as the difficulty of identifying CR points without prior knowledge, low efficiency, and limited extraction accuracy. An extraction method of the phase center for CR points without prior knowledge was proposed in this paper through the construction of a geometric error compensation model for SAR images and the study of high precision fitting methods of the phase center for CR points. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by the Gaofen-3 (GF-3) satellite image data. Experimental results demonstrated that the extraction accuracy of CR points could be better than 0.2 pixel for GF-3 images.

            To address gaps in understanding how external stresses influence remote-sensing inversion of vegetation biochemical components, a P-PROSAIL model incorporating stress factors was developed, with Shunchang County and Yanping District in Fujian Province as the study areas. The model's effectiveness was assessed, yielding R² values of 0.7133, 0.7066, 0.6441, 0.6392, 0.6057, 0.7038, 0.5323, and 0.5149 for leaf area index (LAI), canopy dry matter content (CDMC), canopy cellulose content (CCC), canopy lignin content (CLC), canopy protein content (CPC), canopy nitrogen content (CNC), canopy tannin content (CTC), and canopy flavonoid content (CFC), respectively. While CDMC and most other components showed stable inversions, CTC and CFC exhibited uncertainties due to pest stress. This study clarified the internal and external change characteristics and mechanisms of Moso bamboo forests underPantana phyllostachysaestress, providing empirical support for the ecological health of bamboo forests.

            This paper presents a novel artificial intelligence framework based on a spatiotemporal feature joint learning network aimed at con - structing a trainable end-to-end intelligent model for ocean wave period and direction inversion, effectively addressing issues inherent in traditional spectral analysis methods. The spatiotemporal feature joint learning network model proficiently integrates spatial and temporal information of waves and directly maps the obtained results to wave period and direction. The efficacy of the proposed model is validated through application to both simulation data and actual field test data. Comparative analysis with wave period and direction derived from traditional spectral analysis methods reveals a reduction in root mean square error by 0.08 s and 5.5°, respectively, alongside an increase in correlation coefficient by 8% and 9%, respectively, demonstrating that the intelligent method enhances the accuracy of ocean wave parameter inversion without requiring prior knowledge.

            This study estimated aboveground carbon stock (AGC) using field data and integrated multi-source remote sensing imagery to understand the effects of Pantana phyllostachysae Chao (P. phyllostachysae) stress. AGC remote sensing inversion was performed while accounting for P. phyllostachysae stress, and changes were analyzed. Results indicate: (1) Carbon content coefficients of Moso bamboo leaves, branches, and culms under pest stress ranged from 0.422 to 0.543 g/g, decreasing with increased stress. (2) A random forest model using multi-source data demonstrated the best performance (R2 = 0.688), estimating average AGC at 28.427 t/ha and total carbon sequestration at 913.902 MtC (Million tons of Carbon). (3) Increased pest stress resulted in gradual reductions in AGC. (4) Pest stress is estimated to result in a carbon sequestration loss of 77.443 MtC. The AGC estimation model indicates thatP. phyllostachysaesignificantly reduces AGC, providing crucial data for understanding carbon cycling and enhancing carbon sink management in Moso bamboo forests.

            Deep learning–based high-definition building mapping faces challenges due to the need for extensive high-quality training data, leading to significant annotation costs. To mitigate this challenge, we introduce Box2Boundary, a novel approach using box supervision, in conjunction with the segment anything model (SAM), to achieve cost-effective rooftop delineation. Leveraging the tiny InternImage architecture for enhanced feature extraction and using the dynamic scale training strategy to tackle scale variance, Box2Boundary demonstrates superior performance compared to alternative box-supervised methods. Extensive experiments on the Wuhan University Building Data Set validate our method's effectiveness, showcasing remarkable results with an average precision of 48.7%, outperforming DiscoBox, BoxInst, and Box2Mask by 22.0%, 11.3%, and 2.0%, respectively. In semantic segmentation, our method achieved an F1score of 89.54%, an overall accuracy (OA) of 97.73%, and an intersection over union (IoU) of 81.06%, outperforming all other bounding-box-supervised methods, image tag–supervised methods, and most scribble-supervised methods. It also demonstrated competitive performance compared to fully supervised methods and scribble-supervised methods. SAM integration further boosts performance, yielding an F1score of 90.55%, OA of 97.84%, and IoU of 82.73%. Our approach's efficacy extends to the Waterloo Building and xBD Data Sets, achieving an OA of 98.48%, IoU of 84.72%, and F1score of 91.73% for the former and an OA of 97.32%, IoU of 60.10%, and F1score of 75.08% for the latter. These results underscore the method's robustness and cost-effectiveness in rooftop delineation across diverse data sets.

            This study assesses two techniques for generating point clouds based on dense image matching (DIM): semiglobal matching (SGM) implemented in Trimble INPHO MATCH-3DX software, and a deep-learning algorithm Pyramid Stereo Matching Network (PSMNet). The PSMNet was trained using three datasets with both automated driving and aerial scenes. Two other distinctive sites were selected to assess the accuracy against LiDAR data. The study found inaccuracies in the PSMNet point clouds and suggested that SGM could potentially result in a better outcome. However, for flat slab or ground surface, its root-mean-square error is better than SGM. The analysis showed that the SGM analyses favorably remove points on vertical surfaces due to occlusion, while PSMNet incorrectly extrapolate them with slopes. Furthermore, the assessment identified the potential to improve PSMNet by using more or in-distribution training dataset for test (unseen) areas.

            Vanishing points provide geometric information about a scene and assist in camera calibration, scene understanding, and 3D reconstruction. The random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm faces challenges of low efficiency and insufficient robustness. With prior information, the Bayesian sample consensus (BaySAC) algorithm can efficiently derive the correct parameters and compensate for the deficiencies of the RANSAC algorithm. This study proposes an improved BaySAC vanish - ing point detection algorithm, which uses a linear grouping strategy to enhance the distribution of inliers across groups and accelerate convergence. In the continuous frame vanishing point tracking problem, the detection result of the previous frame is employed as a priori infor - mation for the subsequent frames, facilitating efficient convergence for vanishing point detection and tracking in videos. Experimental results on both benchmark datasets and real-world image sets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves remarkable accuracy and efficiency, enabling real-time performance for vanishing point detection and track- ing. The code is available at https://github. com/CHEMYE/BaySAC.

            Forest fires have a profound influence on the economy, ecology, and environment. Realizing the potential of remote sensing in forest fire management, a study was taken up to investigate the spatiotemporal behavior of active forest fires in a mountainous terrain of Uttarakhand State, north India, using 15 years' time-series historical MODIS (C6) active fire point products. Results indicate an over-all fire incidence detection accuracy of 62.3% with a KHAT value of 0.59. Moreover, a regular trend in intra-annual behavior in fire incidences with peaks during the hot and dry period of the year was observed and a large year-to-year variability in fire regimes with no significant trends over time could be noticed. The approach and results are discussed in detail along with the future perspective.

In this study, we developed a climbing algorithm and combined it with a deep learning model to extract forests and achieve individual tree segmentation using lidar point clouds. We tested the algorithm on mixed forests within complex environments scanned by unmanned aircraft system lidar in ecological restoration mining areas along the Yangtze River of China. Quantitative assessments of the segmentation results showed that the forest extraction achieved a kappa coefficient of 0.88, and the individual tree segmentation results achieved F-scores ranging from 0.86 to 1. The climbing algorithm successfully reduced false positives and false negatives with the increased crown overlapping and outperformed the widely used top-down region-growing point cloud segmentation method. The results indicate that the climbing algorithm proposed in this study will help solve the overlapped crown problem of tree segmentation under complex environments.

            As global trade and maritime traffic develop, exploring ship detection in remote sensing images has become a research hotspot. However, ships in remote sensing images are so small that it leads to a high detection leakage rate and excessive model parameters, making them difficult to apply on remote sensing equipment with limited resources. To address the challenge, we propose a light-weight ship object detection algorithm, adaptive layered multi-scale You Only Look Once version 8 (ALM-YOLOv8), based on multi-scale perception and feature enhancement. To enhance the model's perception of contextual information in complex backgrounds, a multi-scale channel fusion module is constructed to extract features of various scales. To enhance the extracted features, a small-object detection layer and a dynamic channel attention convolution that assigns dynamic weights are proposed. Additionally, this study embeds the large separable kernel attention mechanism into the original network, which lightens the model. Experiments on the HRSC2016 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of ALM-YOLOv8.

            The security of the transmission line corridor is an important guar- antee for the sustainable supply of electricity and an important prerequisite for the rapid development of the economy. Transmission corridors located in high mountains and valleys are often threatened by geological disasters, which seriously affect their stable operation. This research investigates the landslide in the Kunming transmission corridor using 79 Sentinel-1A SAR images from July 2020 to October 2021. Using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) methods, deformation changes before the landslide are analyzed. Factors like precipitation, lithology, and vegetation coverage demonstrate a correlation with landslide occurrence. Seasonal variations in deformation were related to precipitation. The landslide's primary causes are attributed to precipitation, carbonate karstification, and vegetation coverage. Ultimately, this research establishes a correlation between deformation changes and influencing factors in the Kunming transmission corridor, contributing to a deeper understanding of landslide evolution and ensuring the corridor's security for sustainable electricity supply and economic development.

            Object detection is crucial to extracting and analyzing information autonomously from high-resolution remote sensing images (HRSIs). To address ideal blocking for large-scale  HRSI object detection, this study uses a novel adaptive orientation object-detection method for largescale HRSIs based on multi-scale block fusion. An adaptive orientation object-detection  framework based on a convolutional neural network is applied to detect diverse objects of large-scale HRSIs through different block scales; average precision (AP) values of diverse object  detection results are calculated at different block scales. Then, block scales matching the largest AP values of diverse objects are determined based on statistical results of the AP  values of the diverse object at different block scales. Finally, object-detection results at block scales matching the largest AP values of diverse objects are fused by the non-maximum  suppression algorithm to achieve large-scale HRSI object-detection results. Experimental findings reveal that the proposed method is better than any single block-scale object-detection  method, resulting in satisfactory large-scale HRSI object-detection results.

            In recent years, with the gradual increase of neural network Params (the aggregate of trainable elements in a model, including weights, biases, and other adjustable elements)  and calculation volume, model compression within an acceptable range of network accuracy variations has emerged as a prominent research focus in the field of deep learning. Model  pruning and knowledge distillation have been widely used for reducing the complexity and storage cost of neural networks. This study designs the Remote Sensing Object Detection Network  (RSODNet), a lightweight model for remote sensing image object detection, and proposes bridging cross-task distillation network slimming (BCDNS) as a method that integrates model pruning and  knowledge distillation. The experiment results indicate that RSODNet outperforms the YOLOv8 model in various metrics while maintaining almost unchanged Params and calculation volume. The  BCDNS method eliminates redundant channels while preserving a priori knowledge of the initial model intact. This study offers technical support for compressed models used in object detection  from remote sensing images

            Earthquakes deposit loose materials in gullies, making seismic mountain gorges prone to landslides and debris flows. Monitoring and predicting ground deformation in these areas is essential. This study introduces a CS-Elman prediction model based on SBAS-InSAR monitoring. SBAS-InSAR technology analyzes 36 Sentinel-1A im- ages from Wenchuan County, Sichuan Province, China (June 2021 to October 2023), focusing on deformation areas and precipitation data. The CS algorithm optimizes the Elman network's parameters, using SBAS-InSAR data as training samples. Validation shows that: (1) Wenchuan County experiences varied deformation, with Banzi Gully in Miansi Town showing the highest uplift at 183.74 mm/a due to heavy rain. (2) As sample size increases, prediction error decreases and accuracy improves. Predictions suggest ongo- ing uplift at about 4.50 mm per month above Cutou Gully over the next four months, highlighting the need for continued monitoring.

            This study proposes an automated tailings pond-detection method based on the YOLOv8-RVSW model to address the limitations of traditional surveys. A tailings pond dataset was created using high-resolution satellite images, and data quality was improved through data augmentation techniques. In the model, YOLOv8's backbone feature network was replaced with RepViT to effectively capture global and local information. Additionally, the C2f module was enhanced to QuadraSE_C2f to focus on essential feature channels, and WIoUv3 was used as the loss function to improve object localization and detection accuracy. Experimental results indicate that compared with the original model, accuracy increased by 3.9% to 97.4%, recall improved by 4.9% to 96.3%, and mean average precision rose by 2.4% to 98.5%. This method significantly enhances the automation and intelligence of tailings pond monitoring, providing an effective tool for emergency monitoring.
