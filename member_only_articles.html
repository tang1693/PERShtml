            This study assesses two techniques for generating point clouds based on dense image matching (DIM): semiglobal matching (SGM) implemented in Trimble INPHO MATCH-3DX software, and a deep-learning algorithm Pyramid Stereo Matching Network (PSMNet). The PSMNet was trained using three datasets with both automated driving and aerial scenes. Two other distinctive sites were selected to assess the accuracy against LiDAR data. The study found inaccuracies in the PSMNet point clouds and suggested that SGM could potentially result in a better outcome. However, for flat slab or ground surface, its root-mean-square error is better than SGM. The analysis showed that the SGM analyses favorably remove points on vertical surfaces due to occlusion, while PSMNet incorrectly extrapolate them with slopes. Furthermore, the assessment identified the potential to improve PSMNet by using more or in-distribution training dataset for test (unseen) areas.

            Vanishing points provide geometric information about a scene and assist in camera calibration, scene understanding, and 3D reconstruction. The random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm faces challenges of low efficiency and insufficient robustness. With prior information, the Bayesian sample consensus (BaySAC) algorithm can efficiently derive the correct parameters and compensate for the deficiencies of the RANSAC algorithm. This study proposes an improved BaySAC vanish - ing point detection algorithm, which uses a linear grouping strategy to enhance the distribution of inliers across groups and accelerate convergence. In the continuous frame vanishing point tracking problem, the detection result of the previous frame is employed as a priori infor - mation for the subsequent frames, facilitating efficient convergence for vanishing point detection and tracking in videos. Experimental results on both benchmark datasets and real-world image sets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves remarkable accuracy and efficiency, enabling real-time performance for vanishing point detection and track- ing. The code is available at https://github. com/CHEMYE/BaySAC.

            Forest fires have a profound influence on the economy, ecology, and environment. Realizing the potential of remote sensing in forest fire management, a study was taken up to investigate the spatiotemporal behavior of active forest fires in a mountainous terrain of Uttarakhand State, north India, using 15 years' time-series historical MODIS (C6) active fire point products. Results indicate an over-all fire incidence detection accuracy of 62.3% with a KHAT value of 0.59. Moreover, a regular trend in intra-annual behavior in fire incidences with peaks during the hot and dry period of the year was observed and a large year-to-year variability in fire regimes with no significant trends over time could be noticed. The approach and results are discussed in detail along with the future perspective.

            Accurate individual tree segmentation, which is important for forestry investigation, is still a difficult and challenging task. In this study, we developed a climbing algorithm and combined it with a deep learning model to extract forests and achieve individual tree segmentation using lidar point clouds. We tested the algorithm on mixed forests within complex environments scanned by unmanned aircraft system lidar in ecological restoration mining areas along the Yangtze River of China. Quantitative assessments of the segmentation results showed that the forest extraction achieved a kappa coefficient of 0.88, and the individual tree segmentation results achieved F-scores ranging from 0.86 to 1. The climbing algorithm successfully reduced false positives and false negatives with the increased crown overlapping and outperformed the widely used top-down region-growing point cloud segmentation method. The results indicate that the climbing algorithm proposed in this study will help solve the overlapped crown problem of tree segmentation under complex environments.

            As global trade and maritime traffic develop, exploring ship detection in remote sensing images has become a research hotspot. However, ships in remote sensing images are so small that it leads to a high detection leakage rate and excessive model parameters, making them difficult to apply on remote sensing equipment with limited resources. To address the challenge, we propose a light-weight ship object detection algorithm, adaptive layered multi-scale You Only Look Once version 8 (ALM-YOLOv8), based on multi-scale perception and feature enhancement. To enhance the model's perception of contextual information in complex backgrounds, a multi-scale channel fusion module is constructed to extract features of various scales. To enhance the extracted features, a small-object detection layer and a dynamic channel attention convolution that assigns dynamic weights are proposed. Additionally, this study embeds the large separable kernel attention mechanism into the original network, which lightens the model. Experiments on the HRSC2016 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of ALM-YOLOv8.

            The security of the transmission line corridor is an important guar- antee for the sustainable supply of electricity and an important prerequisite for the rapid development of the economy. Transmission corridors located in high mountains and valleys are often threatened by geological disasters, which seriously affect their stable operation. This research investigates the landslide in the Kunming transmission corridor using 79 Sentinel-1A SAR images from July 2020 to October 2021. Using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) methods, deformation changes before the landslide are analyzed. Factors like precipitation, lithology, and vegetation coverage demonstrate a correlation with landslide occurrence. Seasonal variations in deformation were related to precipitation. The landslide's primary causes are attributed to precipitation, carbonate karstification, and vegetation coverage. Ultimately, this research establishes a correlation between deformation changes and influencing factors in the Kunming transmission corridor, contributing to a deeper understanding of landslide evolution and ensuring the corridor's security for sustainable electricity supply and economic development.

            Object detection is crucial to extracting and analyzing information autonomously from high-resolution remote sensing images (HRSIs). To address ideal blocking for large-scale  HRSI object detection, this study uses a novel adaptive orientation object-detection method for largescale HRSIs based on multi-scale block fusion. An adaptive orientation object-detection  framework based on a convolutional neural network is applied to detect diverse objects of large-scale HRSIs through different block scales; average precision (AP) values of diverse object  detection results are calculated at different block scales. Then, block scales matching the largest AP values of diverse objects are determined based on statistical results of the AP  values of the diverse object at different block scales. Finally, object-detection results at block scales matching the largest AP values of diverse objects are fused by the non-maximum  suppression algorithm to achieve large-scale HRSI object-detection results. Experimental findings reveal that the proposed method is better than any single block-scale object-detection  method, resulting in satisfactory large-scale HRSI object-detection results.

            In recent years, with the gradual increase of neural network Params (the aggregate of trainable elements in a model, including weights, biases, and other adjustable elements)  and calculation volume, model compression within an acceptable range of network accuracy variations has emerged as a prominent research focus in the field of deep learning. Model  pruning and knowledge distillation have been widely used for reducing the complexity and storage cost of neural networks. This study designs the Remote Sensing Object Detection Network  (RSODNet), a lightweight model for remote sensing image object detection, and proposes bridging cross-task distillation network slimming (BCDNS) as a method that integrates model pruning and  knowledge distillation. The experiment results indicate that RSODNet outperforms the YOLOv8 model in various metrics while maintaining almost unchanged Params and calculation volume. The  BCDNS method eliminates redundant channels while preserving a priori knowledge of the initial model intact. This study offers technical support for compressed models used in object detection  from remote sensing images

            Earthquakes deposit loose materials in gullies, making seismic mountain gorges prone to landslides and debris flows. Monitoring and predicting ground deformation in these areas is essential. This study introduces a CS-Elman prediction model based on SBAS-InSAR monitoring. SBAS-InSAR technology analyzes 36 Sentinel-1A im- ages from Wenchuan County, Sichuan Province, China (June 2021 to October 2023), focusing on deformation areas and precipitation data. The CS algorithm optimizes the Elman network's parameters, using SBAS-InSAR data as training samples. Validation shows that: (1) Wenchuan County experiences varied deformation, with Banzi Gully in Miansi Town showing the highest uplift at 183.74 mm/a due to heavy rain. (2) As sample size increases, prediction error decreases and accuracy improves. Predictions suggest ongo- ing uplift at about 4.50 mm per month above Cutou Gully over the next four months, highlighting the need for continued monitoring.

            This study proposes an automated tailings pond-detection method based on the YOLOv8-RVSW model to address the limitations of traditional surveys. A tailings pond dataset was created using high-resolution satellite images, and data quality was improved through data augmentation techniques. In the model, YOLOv8's backbone feature network was replaced with RepViT to effectively capture global and local information. Additionally, the C2f module was enhanced to QuadraSE_C2f to focus on essential feature channels, and WIoUv3 was used as the loss function to improve object localization and detection accuracy. Experimental results indicate that compared with the original model, accuracy increased by 3.9% to 97.4%, recall improved by 4.9% to 96.3%, and mean average precision rose by 2.4% to 98.5%. This method significantly enhances the automation and intelligence of tailings pond monitoring, providing an effective tool for emergency monitoring.

            In recent years, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) vehicle detection has become a research hotspot. However, algorithms using horizontal bounding boxes can lead to redundant detection areas due to the varying aspect ratio and arbitrary orientation of vehicle targets. This paper proposes a morphology-based feature extraction network (MFE-Net), which fully uses the prior shape knowledge of the vehicle targets. Specifically, we adopt rotatable bounding boxes to predict the targets, and a novel rectangular rotation-invariant coordinate convolution (RRICC) is proposed to extract the feature, which can determine more accurately the convolutional sampling location of the vehicles. The adaptive thresholding denoising module (ATDM) is designed to suppress background clutter. Furthermore, inspired by the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and self-attention, we propose the hybrid representation enhancement module (HREM) to highlight the vehicle target features. The experiment results show that the proposed model obtains an average precision (AP) of 93.1% on the SAR vehicle detection data set (SVDD).

            The spatial and spectral features of hyperspectral images exhibit complementarity, and neglecting them prevents the full exploitation of useful information for superresolution. This article proposes a spatial-spectral middle cross-attention fusion network to explore the spatial-spectral structure correlation. Initially, we learn spatial and spectral features through spatial and spectral branches instead of single ones to reduce information compression. Then, a novel middle-cross attention fusion block that includes middle features fusion strategy and cross-attention is proposed to fuse spatial-spectral features to enhance their mutual effects, which aims to explore the spatial-spectral structural correlations. Finally, we propose a spectral feature compensation mechanism to provide complementary information for adjacent band groups. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in object values and visual quality.

Most data-driven deep networks extract features of hyperspectral images (HSIs) by stacking convolutional layers to achieve endmember extraction and abundance estimation. Some model-driven networks have strong interpretability but fail to mine the deep feature. We propose a variable-iterative fully convolutional neural network (VIFCNN) for sparse unmixing, combining the characteristics of these two networks. Under the model-driven iterative framework guided by sparse unmixing by variable splitting and augmented lagrangian (SUnSAL), a data-driven spatial-spectral feature learning module and a spatial information updating module are introduced to enhance the learning of data information. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets show that VIFCNN significantly outperforms several traditional unmixing methods and two deep learning-based methods. On real datasets, our method improves signal-to-reconstruction error by 17.38%, reduces abundance root-mean-square error by 25.24%, and reduces abundance spectral angle distance by 31.40% compared with U-ADMM-ßUNet.

            Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) automatic target recognition (ATR) models based on deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to adversarial attacks. In this study, we proposed an SAR black-box local adversarial attack algorithm named attention heat map- based black-box local adversarial attack (AH-BLAA). First, we designed an attention heat map extraction module combined with the layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) algorithm to obtain the high concerning areas of the SAR-ATR models. Then, to gener- ate SAR adversarial attack examples, we designed a perturbation generator module, introducing the structural dissimilarity (DSSIM) metric in the loss function to limit image distortion and the dif- ferential evolution (DE) algorithm to search for optimal perturba- tions. Experimental results on the MSTAR and FUSAR-Ship datasets showed that compared with existing adversarial attack algorithms, the attack success rate of the AH-BLAA algorithm increased by 0.63% to 33.59% and 1.05% to 17.65%, respectively. Moreover, the low- est perturbation ratios reached 0.23% and 0.13%, respectively.

            Responding to the shortcomings of China's civil remote sensing data in land cover classification, such as the difficulty of data acquisition and the low utilization rate, we used Landsat-8, China Orbita Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral remote sensing (OHS) data, and Landsat-8 + OHS data combined with band (red, green, and blue) and vegetation index features to classify land cover using maximum likelihood (ML), Mahalanobis distance (MD), and support vector machine (SVM). The results show that Landsat-8 + OHS data have the highest classification accuracy in SVM, with an overall accuracy of 83.52% and a kappa coefficient of 0.71, and this result is higher than that of Landsat-8 images and OHS images separately. In addition, the classification accuracy of OHS images was higher than that of Landsat-8 images. The results of the study provide a reference for the use of civil satellite remote sensing data in China.

            Few-shot remote sensing scene classification identifies new classes from limited labeled samples where the great challenges are intraclass diversity, interclass similarity, and limited supervision. To alleviate these problems, a teacher-student prototype enhancement network is proposed for a few-shot remote sensing scene classification. Instead of introducing an attentional mechanism in mainstream studies, a prototype enhancement module is recommended to adaptively select high-confidence query samples, which can enhance the support prototype representations to emphasize intraclass and interclass relationships. The construction of a few-shot teacher model generates more discriminative predictive representations with inputs from many labeled samples, thus providing a strong supervisory signal to the student model and encouraging the network to achieve accurate classification with a limited number of labeled samples. Extensive experiments of four public datasets, including NWPU-remote sens ing image scene classification (NWPU-RESISC45), aerial image dataset (AID), UC Merced, and WHU-RS19, demonstrate that this method achieves superior competitive performance than the state-of-the-art methods on five-way, one-shot, and five-shot classifications.

            Crane automation requires a three-dimensional (3D) map around cranes that should be reconstructed and updated quickly.In this study, a high-precision classification method was developed to distinguish stationary objects from moving objects in moving images captured by a monocular camera to stabilize 3D reconstruction. To develop the method, a moving image was captured while the crane was slewed with a monocular camera mounted vertically downward at the tip of the crane. The boom length and angle data were output from a control device, a controller area network. For efficient development, a simulator that imitated the environment of an actual machine was developed and used. The proposed method uses optical flow to track feature points. The classification was performed successfully, independent of derricking motion. Consequently, the proposed method contributes to stable 3D mapping around cranes in construction sites.

            Point cloud semantic segmentation is a key step in 3D scene understanding and analysis. In recent years, deep learning–based point cloud semantic segmentation methods have received extensive attention from researchers. Multi-scale neighborhood feature learning methods are suitable for inhomogeneous density point clouds, but different scale branching feature learning increases the computational complexity and makes it difficult to accurately fuse different scale features to express local information. In this study, a point cloud semantic segmentation network based on RandLA-Net with multi-scale local feature aggregation and adaptive fusion is proposed. The designed structure can reduce computational complexity and accurately express local features. The mean intersection-over-union is improved by 1.1% on the SemanticKITTI data set with an inference speed of nine frames per second, while the mean intersection-over-union is improved by 0.9% on the S3DIS data set, compared with RandLA-Net. We also conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the proposed key structure.

            Star identification algorithms can be applied to resident space object (RSO) surveillance, which includes a large number of stars and false stars. This paper proposes an efficient, robust star identification algorithm for RSO surveillance based on a neural network. First, a feature called equal-frequency binning radial feature (EFB-RF) is proposed for guide stars, and a superficial neural network is constructed for feature classification. Then the training set is generated based on EFB-RF. Finally, the remaining stars are identified using a residual star matching method. The simulation experiment and results show that the identification rate of our algorithm can reach 99.82% under 1 pixel position noise, and it can reach 99.54% under 5% false stars. When the percentage of missing stars is 15%, it can reach 99.40%. The algorithm is verified by RSO surveillance.

            In this paper, wavelets are applied to develop new models for the self-calibration of aerial metric camera systems. It is well known and mathematically proven that additional parameters (APs) can compensate image distortions and remaining error sources by a rigorous photogrammetric bundle-block adjustment. Thus, kernel functions based on orthogonal wavelets (e. g., asymmetric Daubechies wave- lets, least asymmetric Daubechies wavelets, Battle-Lemarié wavelets, Meyer wavelets) are used to build the wavelets-based family of APs for self-calibrating digital frame cameras. These new APs are called wavelet APs. Its applications in rigorous tests are accomplished by using aerial images taken by an airborne digital mapping camera in situ and practical calibrations. The test results demonstrate that these orthogonal wavelet APs are applicable and largely avoid the risk of over-parameterization. Their external accuracy is evaluated using reliable and high precision check points in the calibration field.

            The aging condition of asphalt pavement is an invaluable basis for traffic infrastructure evaluation. Due to the amount of time and high cost of monitoring and identifying asphalt pavement aging, many current studies focus on satellite remote sensing methods. In this paper, some methods and technologies for monitoring asphalt pavement degradation by optical satellite remote sensing are introduced as a literature review. Many researchers have developed spectrum libraries based on the actual aging of asphalt pavements, and it is possible to construct pavement health indices based on spectrum changes. Some indexes can extract different aging degrees of asphalt pavement from optical satellite images. Of course, current research can only preliminarily reflect the aging phenomenon of asphalt pavement and cannot accurately describe the distress characteristics of asphalt pavement. Future research needs to further strengthen mechanism research, develop higher resolution images, improve image processing technology, and adopt multi-means fusion analysis methods.

            High‐resolution remote sensing images can support machine learning methods to achieve remarkable results in agricultural monitoring. However, traditional supervised learning methods require pre-labeled training data and are unsuitable for non-fully labeled areas. Positive and Unlabeled Learning (PUL), can deal with unlabeled data. A loss function PU-Loss was proposed in this study to directly optimize the PUL evaluation metric and to address the data imbalance problem caused by unlabeled positive samples. Moreover, a hybrid normalization module Batch Instance-Layer Normalization was proposed to perform multiple normalization methods based on the resolution size and to improve the model performance further. A real‐world positive and unlabeled winter wheat data set was used to evaluate the proposed method, which outperformed widely used models such as U‐Net, DeepLabv3+, and DA‐Net. The results demonstrated the potential of PUL for winter wheat identification in remote sensing images.

            Shadows in remote sensing images contain crucial information about various features on the ground. In this study, a method for detecting building shadows in GF‐2 images based on improved quick shift was proposed. First, six feature variables were constructed: first principal component (PC1), brightness component (I), normalized difference shadow index (NDSI), morphological shadow index (MSI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Then, the image was segmented to obtain homogeneous objects, which were then classified using a random forest model. Two improvements were added to the quick shift algorithm: using PC1, I, and MSI as input data instead of RGB images; and adding Canny edge constraints. Validation in six research areas yields Kappa coefficients of 0.928, 0.896, 0.89, 0.913, 0.879, and 0.909, confirming method feasibility. In addition, comparative experiments demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness across different land cover types while mitigating the segmentation scale effect.

            The study explores the potential of next-generation satellite hyperspectral imaging systems for screening and predicting surface‐soil contamination and degradation by exploiting various spectral indices and signature‐matching techniques at a heavily industrialized area in India. The soil moisture content, desertification and salinity status, clay or fine material content, heavy metal content, vegetation health status, and stress levels were assessed from continuum-removed spectral reflectance values. Results indicated the presence of water in two tailings ponds, high salinity, and desertification values in most of the tailings ponds and dump sites, clay boundary liner along four ponds, high heavy metal indices along three ponds and all dump sites, highly stressed vegetation near all tailings ponds and coal dump sites, and pollutants in nearby water channels. The results suggest a strategy for the initial identification of priority areas for ground-based investigations and an alternative rapid methodology to monitor large industrial hubs in India.

            Remote sensing applications require high-resolution images to obtain precise information about the Earth???s surface. Multispectral images have high spatial resolution but low spectral resolution. Hyperspectral images have high spectral resolution but low spatial resolution. This study proposes a residual learning and attention-based parallel network based on residual network and channel attention. The network performs image fusion of a high spatial resolution multispectral image and a low spatial resolution hyperspectral image. The network training and fusion experiments are conducted on four public benchmark data sets to show the effectiveness of the proposed model. The fusion performance is compared with classical signal processing-based image fusion techniques. Four image metrics are used for the quantitative evaluation of the fused images. The proposed network improved fusion ability by reducing the root mean square error and relative dimensionless global error in synthesis and increased the peak signal-to-noise ratio when compared to other state-of-the-art models.

            To evaluate the spatiotemporal changes in the ecological environment of eastern Ukraine since the Russia-Ukraine conflict, this study used MODIS images from March to September 2020 and 2022 to calculate the Remote Sensing-Based Ecological Index. In 2022, compared with 2020, conflict zones exhibited reduced improvement and increased slight degradation, whereas nonconflict areas showed marginal enhancement. Through propensity score matching, the research confirmed the causal relationship between conflict and ecological trends. Pathway analysis revealed that the conflict contributed to 0.016 units increase in ecological quality while reducing the improvement rate by 0.042 units. This study provides empirical support for understanding the correlation between conflicts and specific environmental factors, offering technical references for ecological quality assessments in other conflict areas and future evaluations by the Ukrainian government.

            Remote sensing has been applied to observe large areas of surface water to obtain higher-resolution and long-term continuous observation records of surface water. However, limitations remain in the detection of large-scale and multi-temporal surface water mainly due to the high variability in water surface signatures in space and time. In this study, we developed a surface water remote sensing information extraction model that integrates spectral and temporal characteristics to extract surface water from multi-dimensional data of long-term Landsat scenes to explore the spatiotemporal changes in surface water over decades. The goal is to extract open water in vegetation, clouds, terrain shadows, and other land cover backgrounds from medium-resolution remote sensing images. The average overall accuracy and average kappa coefficient of the classification were verified to be 0.91 and 0.81, respectively. Experiments applied to China’s inland arid area have shown that the method is effective under complex surface environmental conditions.

            Remote sensing image segmentation is a crucial technique in the field of land management. However, existing semantic segmentation networks require a large number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) and have long run times. In this paper, we propose a dual-path feature aggregation network (DPFANet) specifically designed for the low-latency operations required in land management applications. Firstly, we use four sets of spatially separable convolutions with varying dilation rates to extract spatial features. Additionally, we use an improved version of MobileNetV2 to extract semantic features. Furthermore, we use an asymmetric multi-scale fusion module and dual-path feature aggregation module to enhance feature extraction and fusion. Finally, a decoder is constructed to enable progressive up-sampling. Experimental results on the Potsdam data set and the Gaofen image data set (GID) demonstrate that DPFANet achieves overall accuracy of 92.2% and 89.3%, respectively. The FLOPs are 6.72 giga and the number of parameters is 2.067 million.

            The key data for accurate prediction is of great significance to accurately carry out the next step of sustainable land use development plan according to the demand of China. Consequently, the main purposes of our study are: (1) to delineate the characteristics of land use transitions within the Yangtze River Economic Belt; (2) to use the Markov model and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model for comparative analysis and prediction of land use distribution. This study analyzes land use/cover change (LUCC) data from 2010 and 2020 using the land use transition matrix, dynamic degree, and comprehensive index model and predicts 2025 land use by the Markov model. The study identifies a reduction in land usage over 11 years, particularly in grassland. The Markov and ARIMA models' significance is 0.002 (P < 0.01), showing arable land and woodland dominance, with varying changes in other land types.

            The power grid plays a vital role in the construction of livelihood projects by transmitting electrical energy. In the event of insulator explosions on power grid towers, these insulators may detach, presenting potential safety risks to transmission lines. The identification of such failures relies on the examination of images captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, accurately detecting insulator defects remains challenging, particularly when dealing with variations in size. Existing methods exhibit limited accuracy in detecting small objects. In this paper, we propose a novel detection method that incorporates the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) as an attention mechanism into the backbone of the "you only look once" version 5 (YOLOv5) model. Additionally, we integrate a residual structure into the model to learn additional information and features related to insulators, thereby enhancing detection efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieved F1 scores of 0.87 for insulator detection and 0.89 for insulator defect detection. The improved YOLOv5 network shows promise in detecting insulators and their defects in UAV images.

            Image segmentation is essential for object-oriented analysis, and classification is a critical parameter influencing analysis accuracy. However, image classification and segmentation based on spectral features are easily perturbed by the high-frequency information of a high spatial resolution remotely sensed (HSRRS) image, degrading its classification and segmentation quality. This article first presents a pixel texture index (PTI) by describing the texture and edge in a local area surrounding a pixel. Indeed.. The experimental results highlight that the HSRRS image classification and segmentation quality can be effectively improved by combining it with the PTI image. Indeed, the overall accuracy improved from 7% to 14%, and the kappa can be increased from 11% to 24%, respectively.

            Accurately obtaining crop cultivation extent and estimating the cultivated area are significant for adjusting regional planting structure. This article proposes a parcel-level crop classification method using time-series, medium-resolution, remote sensing images and single-phase, high-spatial-resolution, remote sensing images. The deep learning semantic segmentation network feature pyramid network with squeeze-and-excitation network (FPN-SENet) and multi-scale segmentation were used to extract cultivated land parcels from Gaofen-2 imagery, while the pixel-level crop types were classified by using support vector machine algorithms from time-series Sentinel-2 images. Then, the parcel-level crop classification was obtained from the pixel-level crop types and land parcels.

            Drought is a devastating natural hazard and exerts profound effects on both the environment and society. Predicting drought occurrences is significant in aiding decision-making and implementing effective mitigation strategies. In regions characterized by limited data availability, such as Southern Africa, the use of satellite remote sensing data promises an excellent opportunity for achieving this predictive goal. In this article, we assess the effectiveness of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) soil moisture data in predicting drought conditions using multiple linear regression-predicted data and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) soil moisture data.

            Debris flow susceptibility evaluation plays a crucial role in the prevention and control of debris flow disasters. Therefore, this article proposes a convolutional neural network model named multi-level feature extraction network (MFENet). First, a dual-channel CNN architecture incorporating the Embedding Channel Attention mechanism is used to extract shallow features from both digital elevation model images and multispectral images. Subsequently, channel shuffle and feature concatenation are applied to the features from the two channels to obtain fused feature sets. Following this, a deep feature extraction is performed on the fused feature sets using a residual module improved by maximum pooling. Finally, the susceptibility index of gullies to debris flows is calculated based on the similarity scores.

            This paper proposes a framework that combines the improved "You Only Look Once" version 5 (YOLOv5) and SegFormer to extract tailings ponds from multi-source data. Points of interest (POIs) are crawled to capture potential tailings pond regions. Jeffries–Matusita distance is used to evaluate the optimal band combination. The improved YOLOv5 replaces the backbone with the PoolFormer to form a PoolFormer backbone. The neck introduces the CARAFE operator to form a CARAFE feature pyramid network neck (CRF-FPN). The head is substituted with an efficiency decoupled head. POIs and classification data optimize improved YOLOv5 results. After that, the SegFormer is used to delineate the boundaries of tailings ponds. Experimental results demonstrate that the mean average precision of the improved YOLOv5s has increased by 2.78% compared to the YOLOv5s, achieving 91.18%. The SegFormer achieves an intersection over union of 88.76% and an accuracy of 94.28%.

            This article introduces a comprehensive methodology for mapping and assessing the urban built-up areas and establishing a spatial gross domestic product (GDP) model for Zhengzhou using night-time light (NTL) data, alongside socioeconomic statistical data from 2012 to 2017. Two supervised sorting algorithms, namely the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm and the deep learning (DL) algorithm, which includes the U-Net and fully convolutional neural (FCN) network models, are proposed for urban built-up area identification and image classification. Comparisons with Municipal Bureau of Statistics data highlight the U-Net neural network model exhibits superior accuracy, especially in areas with diverse characteristics. For each year from 2012 to 2017, a spatial GDP model was developed based on Zhengzhou's urban GDP and U-Net sorted images. This research provides valuable insights into urban development and economic assessment for the city.

            A devastating landslide incident occurred on 24 June 2017, causing huge losses for Xinmo Village in western Sichuan. In this paper, we used two interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) methods, permanent scatterer (PS)-InSAR and small baseline subset (SBAS)- InSAR, to analyze deformation signals in the area in the 2 years leading up to the landslide event using Sentinel-1A ascending data. Our experimental findings from PS-InSAR and SBAS-InSAR revealed that the deformation rates in the study region ranged between –50 to 20 mm/year and –30 to 10 mm/year, respectively. Furthermore, the deformation rates of the same points, as determined by these methods, exhibited a significant increase prior to the event. We also investigated the causal relationship between rainfall and landslide events, demonstrating that deformation rates correlate with changes in rainfall, albeit with a time lag. Therefore, using time-series InSAR for landslide monitoring in Xinmo Village is a viable approach.

            The density and uniformity of lidar data play crucial roles in the cor-responding data processing steps. One factor influencing point density and spacing in lidar data is the presence of empty pulses, where no return is detected. Missing returns can occur due to atmospheric absorption, specular and diffusive reflection, etc. To address this issue and enhance point density, this paper introduces a novel method for approximating missing returns in airborne lidar data collected over urban areas. This technique focuses on approximating returns for empty pulses that hit spots near abrupt slope changes on building and ground surfaces. The proposed methodology is validated through experiments using a lidar data set from downtown Dublin, Ireland. The collected data contained numerous gaps associated with wet surfaces, as well as missing returns on vertical and oblique surfaces.

            In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the extraction of high-quality frames to enhance the fidelity of videogrammetry by combining fuzzy frames removal and baseline constraints. We first implement a gradient-based mutual information method to filter out low-quality frames while preserving the integrity of the videos. After frame pose estimation, the geometric properties of the baseline are constrained by three aspects to extract the keyframes: quality of relative orientation, baseline direction, and base to distance ratio. The three-dimensional model is then reconstructed based on these extracted keyframes. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach maintains a strong robustness throughout the aerial triangulation, leading to high levels of reconstruction precision across diverse video scenarios. Compared to other methods, this paper improves the reconstruction accuracy by more than 0.2 mm while simultaneously maintaining the completeness.

            To extract terraced fields in hilly areas on a large scale in an automated and high-precision manner, this paper proposes a terrace extraction method that combines the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Sentinel-2 imagery, and the improved U-Net semantic segmentation model. The U-Net model is modified by introducing Attention Gate modules into its decoding modules to suppress the interference of redundant features and adding Dropout and Batch Normalization layers to improve training speed, robustness, and fitting ability. In addition, the DEM band is combined with the red, green, and blue bands of the remote sensing images to make full use of terrain information. The experimental results show that the Precision, Recall, F1 score, and Mean Intersection over Union of the proposed method for terrace extraction are improved to other mainstream advanced methods, and the internal information of the terraces extracted is more complete, with fewer false positive and false negative results.

            The advancements in space technology have facilitated water quality (WQ) monitoring of lake conditions at a spatial resolution of 10 m by freely accessible Sentinel-2 images. The main aim of this article was to elucidate the necessity of spatiotemporal WQ monitoring of the shrinking Lake Burdur in Türkiye by examining the relation between field and satellite data with a state-of-the-art machine learning- based regression algorithm. This study focuses on detection of algal blooms and WQ parameters, which are chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and suspended solids (SS). Furthermore, this study leverages the advantage of geographic position of Lake Burdur, located at the overlap of two Sentinel-2 frames, which enables the acquisition of satellite images at a temporal resolution of 2–3 days. The findings enrich the understanding of the lake's dynamic structure by rapidly monitoring the occurrence of algal blooms. High accuracies were achieved for Chl-a (R-squared: 0.93) and SS (R-squared: 0.94) detection.

            Few-shot scene classification methods aim to obtain classification discriminative ability from few labeled samples and has recently seen substantial advancements. However, the current few-shot learning approaches still suffer from overfitting due to the scarcity of labeled samples. To this end, a few-shot semi-supervised method is proposed to address this issue. Specifically, semi-supervised learning method is used to increase target domain samples; then we train multiple classification models using the augmented samples. Finally, we perform decision fusion of the results obtained from the multiple models to accomplish the image classification task. According to the experiments conducted on two real few-shot remote sensing scene datasets, our proposed method achieves significantly higher accuracy (approximately 1.70% to 4.33%) compared to existing counterparts.

            With the rapid development of lidar, the accuracy and density of the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) point clouds have been continuously improved. However, in some applications, dense point cloud has no practical meaning. How to effectively sample from the dense points and maximize the preservation of terrain features is extremely important. This paper will propose a DEM sampling algorithm that utilizes terrain complexity and maximal Poisson-disk sampling to extract key feature points for adaptive DEM sampling. The algorithm estimates terrain complexity based on local terrain variation and prioritizes points with high complexity for sampling. The sampling radius is inversely proportional to terrain complexity, while ensuring that points within the radius of accepted samples are not considered new samples. This way makes more points of concern in the rugged regions. The results show that the proposed algorithm has higher global accuracy than the classic six sampling methods.

            Façade image recognition under complex illumination conditions is crucial for various applications, including urban three-dimensional modeling and building identification. Existing methods relying solely on Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images are prone to texture ambiguity in complex illumination environments. Furthermore, façades display varying orientations and camera viewing angles, resulting in performance issues within the RGB color space. In this study, we introduce an illumination-invariant façade recognition network (I2-FaçadeNet) that leverages sparsely gated multi-color space experts for enhanced façade image recognition in challenging illumination environments. First, RGB façade images are converted into multi-color spaces to eliminate the ambiguous texture in complex illumination. Second, we train expert networks using separate channels of multi-color spaces. Finally, a sparsely gated mechanism is introduced to manage the expert networks, enabling dynamic activation of expert networks and the merging of results. Experimental evaluations leveraging both the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing benchmark data sets and the Shenzhen data sets reveal that our proposed I2-FaçadeNet surpasses various depths of ResNet in façade recognition under complex illumination conditions. Specifically, the classification accuracy for poorly illuminated façades in Zurich improves by nearly 8%, while the accuracy for over-illuminated areas in Shenzhen increases by approximately 3%. Moreover, ablation studies conducted on façade images with complex illumination indicate that compared to traditional RGB-based ResNet, the proposed network achieves an accuracy improvement of 3% to 4% up to 100% for overexposed images and an accuracy improvement of 3% to 10% for underexposed images.

            Expanding urban impervious surface area (ISA) mapping is crucial to sustainable development, urban planning, and environmental studies. Multispectral ISA mapping is challenging because of the mixed-pixel problems with bare soil. This study presents a novel approach using spectral and temporal information to develop a Soil-Suppressed Impervious Surface Area Index (SISAI) using the Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) data set, which reduces the soil but enhances the ISA signature. This study mapped the top 12 populated megacities using SISAI and achieved an over-all accuracy of 0.87 with an F1-score of 0.85. It also achieved a higher Spatial Dissimilarity Index between the ISA and bare soil. However, it is limited by bare gray soil and shadows of clouds and hills. SISAI encourages urban dynamics and inter-urban compari- son studies owing to its automatic and unsupervised methodology.

            Deep learning has been widely used in remote sensing image classification and achieves many excellent results. These methods are all based on relatively balanced data sets. However, in real-world scenarios, many data sets belong to the long-tailed distribution, resulting in poor performance. In view of the good performance of contrastive learning in long-tailed image classification, a new dual-branch fusion learning classification model is proposed to fuse the discriminative features of remote sensing images with spatial data, making full use of valuable image representation information in imbalance data. This paper also presents a hybrid loss, which solves the problem of poor discrimination of extracted features caused by large intra-class variation and inter-class ambiguity. Extended experiments on three long-tailed remote sensing image classification data sets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed dual-branch model based on contrastive learning in long-tailed image classification.

            High altitude lidar scans allow for rapid acquisition of big spatial data representing entire city blocks. Unfortunately, the raw point clouds acquired by this method are largely incomplete due to object occlusions and restrictions in scanning angles and sensor resolution, which can negatively affect the obtained results. In recent years, many new solutions for 3D point cloud completion have been created and tested on various objects; however, the application of these methods to high-altitude lidar point clouds of buildings has not been properly investigated yet. In the above context, this paper presents the results of applying several state-of-the-art point cloud completion networks to various building exteriors acquired by simulated airborne laser scanning. Moreover, the output point clouds generated from partial data are compared with complete ground-truth point clouds. The performed tests show that the SeedFormer network trained on the ShapeNet-55 data set provides promising shape completion results.

            Indoor navigation applications have become widespread in recent years with the ability of mobile phones which determine the position. Due to the inefficiency of global positioning system (GPS) indoors, other positioning methods have been developed based on local networks using technologies such as Bluetooth, wireless networks, ultra-wideband signals, ultrasonic signals, and radio frequency identification modules. Various technologies yield high or medium accuracy. Combining data from multiple sources via fusion enhances location precision. In this study, indoor positions were estimated using trilateration with Bluetooth devices, and the accuracy was improved by applying filters to the data from inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors on the phone. As a result of combining Bluetooth and IMU data with data fusion, submeter accuracy was achieved. The results obtained were tested at Yildiz Technical University-Istanbul Türkiye. It was determined that 92% of the data was obtained with submeter accuracy.

            Accurate and effective rice identification has great significance for the sustainable development of agricultural management and food security. This paper proposes an accurate rice identification method that can solve the confused problem between fragmented rice fields and the surroundings in complex surface areas. The spectral, temporal, and spatial features extracted from the created Sentinel-2 time series were integrated and collaboratively displayed in the form of visual images, and a convolutional neural network model embedded with integrated information was established to further mine the key information that distinguishes rice from other types. The results showed that the overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the proposed method for rice identification reached 99.4%, 99.5%, 99.5%, and 99.5%, respectively, achieving a better performance than the support vector machine classifier. Therefore, the proposed method can effectively reduce the confusion between rice and other types and accurately extract rice distribution information under complex surface conditions.

            Despite much valuable research on the mechanisms for spatio-temporal changesof net primary vegetation productivity (NPP) and net ecosystem productivity (NEP), there is a paucity of information on assessing impacts of regional multiple factors on spatiotemporal researchs of NPP and NEP in the complex environment. This study attempts to bridge this information gap using the Jianghuai Basin in China as a case study. Using a field campaign, remotely sensed imagery, socioeconomic data, and meteorological parameters, we developed a framework based on the Carnegie‐Ames‐Stanford Approach (CASA) model, correlation technique, trend analysis, and landscape metrics to measure spatiotemporal changes in NPP and NEP from 2001 to 2018. The derived changes were then linked to regional multiple factors including climate, landscape factors, human activity, and land use change. The results of the research can provide a scientific basis for vegetation evaluation, ecosystem assessment, and other aspects of the region.

            The incessant rise of artificial surfaces has increased the temperatures of cities, distressing urban health and sustainability. Fast-growing tropical cities particularly call for an understanding of this phenomenon, known as the urban heat island (UHI). The present study was conducted to detect UHI dynamics over the National Capital Region of India. Stretching over more than 32 000 km2, this region consists of urban centers of varying sizes. Landsat thermal bands were processed to extract temperature patterns between 1999 and 2019. Urban climate change was prominent, as a 2349-km2expansion in UHI area was spotted. Urban clusters of different sizes were demarcated by applying the k-nearest neighbor algorithm on the normalized difference building index maps. This empirical analysis helped to form a logarithmic relation between city size and UHI intensity. Observed results set a framework to assess the thermal environment of numerous urban centers from any tropical country. UHI intensity values for various city sizes were computed, as they were crucial to decide the outdoor comfort zones based on the base temperature conditions of other cities. Further, the critical zones in each urban cluster were identified using the vegetation index, and scopes of landscaping were suggested based on the observed building morphologies of different local climate zones.

            Rapid detection of solid waste with remote sensing images is of great significance for environmental protection. In recent years, deep learning-based object detection methods have been widely studied. In contrast to regular objects such as airplanes or buildings, solid wastes commonly h ave arbitrary shapes with difficult‐to‐distinguish boundaries. In this study, a solid waste detection network with a weighted deformable convolution and a global context block based on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) model was proposed. The designed feature extraction structure can help to enhance the boundary and shape features of solid waste. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified on the well-known DetectIon in Optical Remote sensing images data set and further on a solid waste data set, which was collected by the authors manually. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other traditional object detection methods and a maximum improvement of 5.27% was obtained compared to the FPN method.

            Forest fire detection using machine vision has recently emerged as a hot research topic. However, the complexity of background information in smoke images often results in deep learning models losing crucial details while capturing smoke image features. To address this, we present a detection algorithm called Multichannel Smoke YOLOv5s (MCSYOLOv5s). This algorithm comprises a smoke flame detection module, multichannel YOLOv5s (MC‐YOLOv5s), and a smoke cloud classification module, Smoke Classification Network (SCN). MC‐YOLOv5s uses a generative confrontation structure to design a dual‐channel feature extraction network and adopts a new feature cross-fusion mechanism to enhance the smoke feature extraction ability of classic YOLOv5s. The SCN module combines Weather Research and Forecasting numerical forecast results to classify smoke and clouds to reduce false positives caused by clouds. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed forest fire monitoring method, MCS‐YOLOv5s, achieves higher detection accuracy of 95.17%, surpassing all comparative algorithms. Moreover, it effectively reduces false alarms caused by clouds.

            Correspondence selection is an indispensable process in point cloud registration. The success of point cloud registration largely depends on a good correspondence selection method. For this purpose, a novel correspondence selection method is proposed in this paper. First, two geometric constraints, one of which is proposed in this paper, are used to compute the compatibility score between two correspondences. Then, the feature vectors of the correspondences are constructed according to the compatibility scores between the correspondence and others. A support vector machine classifier is trained to classify the correct and incorrect correspondences by using the feature vectors. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can choose the right correspondences well and get high precision and F-score performance. Also, our method has the best robustness to noise, pointdensity variation, and partial overlap compared to the other methods.

            Self-calibration method for the stereo vision system of the Chang’E-5 probe is proposed. The footprints left by the robot arm after touching the ground are regarded as the lunar control points. A stereo constraint is proposed, and a combined adjustment model is established. The accuracy of the proposed method is verified by Earth-based and lunar experiments. In the Earth-based experiment, the proposed method obtained a 3.18 mm average positioning error in 50 sets of tests, the average residual error of nine footprints was 0.45 pixels, and the unit weight mean square error of Moncam B was 0.181 pixels. In the lunar experiment, the proposed method obtained a 3.22 mm average positioning error in 50 sets of tests, and the unit weight mean-square error of Moncam B was 0.172 pixels. The experimental results show that the proposed method provides high accuracy and stability.

            Orthorectification of high-resolution satellite images using a terrain- dependent rational function model (RFM) is a difficult task requiring a well-distributed set of ground control points (GCPs), which is often time-consuming and costly operation. Further, RFM is sensitive to over-parameterization due to its many coefficients, which have no physical meaning. Optimization-based meta-heuristic algorithms ap- pear to be an efficient solution to overcome these limitations. This pa- per presents a complete automated RFM terrain-dependent orthorec- tification for satellite images. The proposed method has two parts; the first part suggests automating the GCP extraction by combing Scale- Invariant Feature Transform and Speeded Up Robust Features algo- rithms; and the second part introduces the cascaded meta-heuristic al- gorithm using genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization. In this stage, a modified K-means clustering selection technique was used to support the proposed algorithm for finding the best combinations of GCPs and RFM coefficients. The obtained results are promising in terms of accuracy and stability compared to other literature methods.

            Analyzing rice growth is essential for examining pests, illnesses, lodging, and yield. To create a Digital Surface Model (DSM ) of three important rice breeding stages, an efficient and fast (compared to manual monitoring) Unoccupied Aerial System was used to collect data. Outliers emerge in DSM as a result of the influence of environ- ment and equipment, and the outliers related to rice not only affect the extraction of rice growth changes but are also more challenging to remove. Therefore, after using ground control points uniform geodetic level for filtering, statistical outlier removal (SOR ) and quadratic surface filtering (QSF ) are used. After that, differential operations are applied to the DSM to create a differential digital surface model that can account for the change in rice plant height. Comparing the prediction accuracy before and after filtering: R2= 0.72, RMSE = 5.13cm, nRMSE = 10.65% for the initial point cloud; after QSF, R2= 0.89, RMSE = 2.51cm, nRMSE = 5.21%; after SOR, R2= 0.92, RMSE = 3.32cm, nRMSE = 6.89%. The findings demonstrate that point cloud filtering, particularly SOR, can increase the accuracy of rice monitoring. The method is effective for monitoring, and after filtering, the accuracy is sufficiently increased to satisfy the needs of growth analysis. This has some potential for application and extension.

            Line features are of great importance for the registration of the Vehicle-Borne Mobile Mapping System that contains both lidar and multiple-lens panoramic cameras. In this work, a spherical straight- line model is proposed to detect the unified line features in the panoramic imaging surface based on the Spherical Hough Transform. The local topological constraints and gradient image voting are also combined to register the line features between panoramic images and lidar point clouds within the Hough parameter space. Experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately extract the long strip targets on the panoramic images and avoid spurious or broken line-segments. Meanwhile, the line matching precision between point clouds and panoramic images are also improved.

            To address the problem of weak robustness against geometric attacks of remote sensing images' digital watermarking, a robust watermark- ing algorithm based on template watermarking is proposed in this paper, which improves the robustness of digital watermarking against geometric attacks by constructing stable geometric attack invari- ant features. In this paper, the Discrete Fourier Transform domain template watermark is used as the invariant feature against geometric attacks, and the embedding of the cyclic watermark is used to improve the watermark robustness for recovering the watermark synchroniza- tion relationship. To achieve blind extraction of the watermark, a parameter extraction method based on noise extraction is designed. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively improve the robustness of digital watermarking of remote sensing images against geometric attacks. Meanwhile, it can also resist common image processing attacks and compound attacks.

            The precise geo-positioning of high-resolution satellite imagery (HRSI) without ground control points (GCPs) is an important and fundamental step in global mapping, three-dimensional modeling, and so on. In this paper, to improve the efficiency of large-scale bundle adjustment (BA), we propose a combined Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) and Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) parallel computing approach for the BA of large-scale HRSI without GCPs. The proposed approach consists of three main components: 1) construction of a BA model without GCPs ; 2) reduction of memory consumption using the Compressed Sparse Row sparse matrix format; and 3) improvement of the computational efficiency by the use of the combined PCG and GPU parallel computing method. The experimental results showed that the proposed method: 1) consumes less memory consumption compared to the conventional full matrix format method; 2) demonstrates higher computational efficiency than the single-core, Ceres-solver and multi-core central processing unit computing methods, with 9.48, 6.82, and 3.05 times faster than the above three methods, respectively; 3) obtains comparable BA accuracy with the above three methods, with image residuals of about 0.9 pixels; and 4) is superior to the parallel bundle adjustment method in the reprojection error.

            Identification of Drought Events in Major Basins of Africa from GRACE Total Water Storage and Modeled Products

            Terrestrial water storage (TWS) plays a vital role in climatological and hydrological processes. Most of the developed drought indices from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) over Africa neglected the influencing roles of individual water storage components in calculating the drought index and thus may either underestimate or overestimate drought characteristics. In this paper, we proposed a Weighted Water Storage Deficit Index for drought assessment over the major river basins in Africa (i. e., Nile, Congo, Niger, Zambezi, and Orange) with accounting for the contribution of each TWS component on the drought signal. We coupled the GRACE data and WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model through utilizing the component contribution ratio as the weight. The results showed that water storage components demonstrated distinctly different contributions to TWS variability and thus drought signal response in onset and duration. The most severe droughts over the Nile, Congo, Niger, Zambezi, and Orange occurred in 2006, 2012, 2006, 2006, and 2003, respectively. The most prolonged drought of 84 months was observed over the Niger basin. This study suggests that considering the weight of individual components in the drought index provides more reasonable and realistic drought estimates over large basins in Africa from GRACE.

            Although most deep learning-based methods have achieved excellent performance for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, they are often limited by complex networks and require massive training samples in practical applications. Therefore, designing an efficient, lightweight model to obtain better classification results under small samples situations remains a challenging task. To alleviate this problem, a novel, lightweight parallel octave convolutional neural network (LPOCNN) for HSI classification is proposed in this paper. First, the HSI data is preprocessed to construct two three-dimensional (3D) patch cubes with different spatial and spectral scales for each central pixel, removing redundancy and focusing on extracting spatial features and spectral features, respectively. Next, two non- deep parallel branches are created for the two inputs, which design octave convolution rather than classical 3D convolution to facilitate light weighting of the model. Then two-dimensional convolutional neural network is used to extract deeper spectral-spatial features when fusing spectral-spatial features from different parallel layers. Moreover, the spectral-spatial attention is designed to promote the classification performance even further by adaptively adjusting the weights of different spectral-spatial features according to their contribution to classification. Experiments show that our suggested LPOCNN acquires a significant advantage on classification performance over other competitive methods under small sample situations.

            Highway markings (HMs) are representative elements of inventory digitalization in highway scenes. The accurate position, semantics, and maintenance information of HMs provide significant support for the intelligent management of highways. This article presents a robust and efficient approach for extracting, reconstructing, and degrading analyzing HMs in complex highway scenes. Compared with existing road marking extraction methods, not only can extract HMs in presence of wear and occlusion from point clouds, but we also perform a degradation analysis for HMs. First, the HMs candidate area is determined accurately by sophisticated image processing. Second, the prior knowledge of marking design rules and edge-based matching model that leverages the standard geometric template and radiometric appearance of HMs is used for accurately extracting and reconstructing solid lines and nonsolid markings of HMs, respectively. Finally, two degradation indicators are constructed to describe the completeness of the marking contour and consistency within the marking. Comprehensive experiments on two existing highways revealed that the proposed methods achieved an overall performance of 95.4% and 95.4% in the recall and 93.8% and 95.5% in the precision for solid line and nonsolid line markings, respectively, even with imperfect data. Meanwhile, a database can be established to facilitate agencies' efficient maintenance.
