            India yearly experiences natural disasters such as floods, droughts, cyclones, and landslides, which not only disrupt but also significantly affect the socioeconomic activities of its people. Darjeeling, one of the most valuable districts of West Bengal, India, is located in the foothills of the mighty Himalayas. Landslides in Darjeeling, particularly during the monsoon season, severely affect the socioeconomic conditions of the local population. This research creates a landslide susceptibility map of Darjeeling using the frequency ratio model (FRM) and geographical weighted regression (GWR). The study considers 16 landslide-conditioning factors and 743 past landslide events, of which 70% are used for modeling and the remaining 30% are used for validation. The generated landslide susceptibility map categorizes the area into very low, low, moderate, high, and very high susceptibility zones. Results show that most of the study area falls within the high susceptibility zone, covering approximately 28.45% of the region. The study also reveals that the northern hilly regions of the district are more prone to landslides compared with the southern part, based on FRM and GWR. The area under curve indicates that the model achieved a 74.7% success rate. The highest value of the landslide density index was found in areas classified as having very high landslide susceptibility. Therefore, considering the landslide susceptibility, implementation of effective management strategies is essential for ensuring the future development of the district.

            This study analyzes COVID-19 response strategies in the top 30 gross domestic product countries from the first case until 30 September 2021, a period marked by increased vaccinations, the dominance of the Delta variant, and changing public health measures. We examined which mitigation efforts effectively reduced new cases and the viral reproduction rate. Vaccination policies, movement restrictions, and mask mandates were critical in reducing cases per million, while testing, public information, income support, and contact tracing were crucial for lowering the viral reproduction rate. Vaccination policies did not significantly affect the reproduction rate during implementation. The gender of leaders showed no significant effect on cases, deaths, or excess mortality, though female leaders generally implemented fewer isolation days and prioritized additional measures like movement restrictions and stay-at-home orders.

            Disease surveillance, including risk modeling, is beneficial for infectious diseases. Risk prediction maps can be used to prioritize areas to deliver vaccines reducing disease transmission. For zoonotic infectious diseases such as Lyme disease, potential vaccine deployment areas include cost-effective places key to vectors, wildlife hosts, and humans. This paper uses machine-learning techniques to develop models to predict Lyme disease risk, then uses the critical variables within the models, as well those considered principal from previous literature, to create a Lyme disease risk map and to prioritize areas for wildlife vaccine deployment. It was found that highest disease risk is in the eastern United States, especially the upper Midwest and Northeast regions, which coincides with previous literature. The study found national parks and counties within these areas to prioritize wildlife vaccine deployment. Future work includes ground-truthing of the risk map and dispersal of vaccine to priority areas.

            Rapid urbanization and population growth have intensified the need for accurate and efficient identification of residential buildings in urban planning and disaster management. This paper presents a novel approach for identifying residential buildings by leveraging multiple source data and a transfer learning model, with a case study conducted in Galveston Island, Texas. We propose an integrated framework that combines very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery, lidar data, points of interest (POI) data, and GIS-based land use information to extract features of residential buildings. We fine-tune a pretrained deep learning model with our data sets to enhance the model’s adaptability and efficiency in detecting residential buildings in the study area. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high accuracy in identifying residential buildings, with overall accuracy of 85.6% in the case study. This study also offers valuable insights into the potential of combining multiple data sources and transfer learning techniques for improving residential building identification and other related tasks in urban remote sensing applications.

            Texture-Semantic Point: Registration for Point Clouds of Porcelain Relics

            Point cloud models of porcelain are captured through the multi-registration of point clouds, which presents a challenging task. On the one hand, the smooth surface of porcelain lacks geometric feature variation, making it difficult to establish corresponding points. On the other hand, the overall geometric symmetry of most porcelain relics can easily lead to iterative calculations falling into the local minimum convergence trap. To address the difficulties in feature point selection, we propose a novel approach using texture-semantic points as features for coarse registration. We first select rich texture points as 2D candidates and establish a 2D-3D matching relationship, giving each candidate its 3D spatial location and associated texture information. Using these correspondences, we perform coarse alignment of the point clouds. However, in reality, the point clouds are not aligned, and the registration calculation fails because of geometric symmetry issues. To address this, we integrate a control net into the iterative closest point (ICP) calculation to guide iterations towards the correct Special Euclidean group in 3 dimensions (SE(3)) transformation, achieving refined alignment. Finally, considering porcelain's symmetrical geometry, we introduce a pose optimization constraint using the symmetry axis as a weighted parameter to limit degrees of freedom and enhance registration accuracy. Experiments were conducted on seven porcelain datasets to evaluate the proposed approach. A qualitative analysis demonstrated successful refined alignment using the proposed approach. In addition, we performed a quantitative comparison with state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results showed that our approach outperformed others across all models when applied to the registration of geometrically symmetric porcelain; Specifically, the proposed method achieved a 50% enhancement in accuracy compared with others, measured by the distance between the labeled corresponding points.

            Coral reefs, with their intricate 3D structures, are vital marine ecosystems increasingly threatened by environmental stressors. Accurate 3D reconstruction of these underwater structures is essential for scientific research and conservation management. While underwater photogrammetry has emerged as a promising tool for this purpose, technical challenges persist in capturing fine-scale features under underwater conditions, particularly the intricate morphology of coral reefs and the highly complex textures that hinder high-fidelity reconstruction. Recent breakthroughs in computer vision and deep learning have introduced new opportunities for underwater photogrammetry. This study begins by outlining a photogrammetric workflow that can integrate current advanced technologies, followed by summarizing cutting-edge methods used in the key stages, i. e., sparse and dense reconstruction. Building on previous research, we propose a hierarchical reconstruction strategy for accurate and efficient dense modeling. Our approach first performs an efficient global coarse-grained reconstruction to capture the overall scene structure, followed by fine-scale modeling in key regions of interest. Using image data collected from a coral reef site at Moorea Island, we compare and evaluate various techniques, analyzing their respective strengths and limitations. In sparse reconstruction, the classical feature method scale-invariant feature transform demonstrates competitive performance. Deep learning–based methods, such as ALIKED feature and the SuperGlue matching network, achieve superior results on certain metrics. For dense reconstruction, Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting–based methods yield high-quality reconstructions but are computationally intensive. In contrast, the deep learning–based multi-view stereo approach achieves comparable reconstruction quality with greater efficiency. Experimental results on reconstruction result fusion further validate that our approach offers a scalable and practical solution for coral reef monitoring, advancing conservation science and ecosystem management practices.

            The geometric calibration accuracy of the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) system is affected by the extraction accuracy of Corner Reflector (CR) points in a Single-Look Complex (SLC) image. There are some problems in traditional artificial extraction methods for CR points, such as the difficulty of identifying CR points without prior knowledge, low efficiency, and limited extraction accuracy. An extraction method of the phase center for CR points without prior knowledge was proposed in this paper through the construction of a geometric error compensation model for SAR images and the study of high precision fitting methods of the phase center for CR points. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by the Gaofen-3 (GF-3) satellite image data. Experimental results demonstrated that the extraction accuracy of CR points could be better than 0.2 pixel for GF-3 images.

            To address gaps in understanding how external stresses influence remote-sensing inversion of vegetation biochemical components, a P-PROSAIL model incorporating stress factors was developed, with Shunchang County and Yanping District in Fujian Province as the study areas. The model's effectiveness was assessed, yielding R² values of 0.7133, 0.7066, 0.6441, 0.6392, 0.6057, 0.7038, 0.5323, and 0.5149 for leaf area index (LAI), canopy dry matter content (CDMC), canopy cellulose content (CCC), canopy lignin content (CLC), canopy protein content (CPC), canopy nitrogen content (CNC), canopy tannin content (CTC), and canopy flavonoid content (CFC), respectively. While CDMC and most other components showed stable inversions, CTC and CFC exhibited uncertainties due to pest stress. This study clarified the internal and external change characteristics and mechanisms of Moso bamboo forests underPantana phyllostachysaestress, providing empirical support for the ecological health of bamboo forests.

            This paper presents a novel artificial intelligence framework based on a spatiotemporal feature joint learning network aimed at con - structing a trainable end-to-end intelligent model for ocean wave period and direction inversion, effectively addressing issues inherent in traditional spectral analysis methods. The spatiotemporal feature joint learning network model proficiently integrates spatial and temporal information of waves and directly maps the obtained results to wave period and direction. The efficacy of the proposed model is validated through application to both simulation data and actual field test data. Comparative analysis with wave period and direction derived from traditional spectral analysis methods reveals a reduction in root mean square error by 0.08 s and 5.5°, respectively, alongside an increase in correlation coefficient by 8% and 9%, respectively, demonstrating that the intelligent method enhances the accuracy of ocean wave parameter inversion without requiring prior knowledge.

            This study estimated aboveground carbon stock (AGC) using field data and integrated multi-source remote sensing imagery to understand the effects of Pantana phyllostachysae Chao (P. phyllostachysae) stress. AGC remote sensing inversion was performed while accounting for P. phyllostachysae stress, and changes were analyzed. Results indicate: (1) Carbon content coefficients of Moso bamboo leaves, branches, and culms under pest stress ranged from 0.422 to 0.543 g/g, decreasing with increased stress. (2) A random forest model using multi-source data demonstrated the best performance (R2 = 0.688), estimating average AGC at 28.427 t/ha and total carbon sequestration at 913.902 MtC (Million tons of Carbon). (3) Increased pest stress resulted in gradual reductions in AGC. (4) Pest stress is estimated to result in a carbon sequestration loss of 77.443 MtC. The AGC estimation model indicates thatP. phyllostachysaesignificantly reduces AGC, providing crucial data for understanding carbon cycling and enhancing carbon sink management in Moso bamboo forests.

            Deep learning–based high-definition building mapping faces challenges due to the need for extensive high-quality training data, leading to significant annotation costs. To mitigate this challenge, we introduce Box2Boundary, a novel approach using box supervision, in conjunction with the segment anything model (SAM), to achieve cost-effective rooftop delineation. Leveraging the tiny InternImage architecture for enhanced feature extraction and using the dynamic scale training strategy to tackle scale variance, Box2Boundary demonstrates superior performance compared to alternative box-supervised methods. Extensive experiments on the Wuhan University Building Data Set validate our method's effectiveness, showcasing remarkable results with an average precision of 48.7%, outperforming DiscoBox, BoxInst, and Box2Mask by 22.0%, 11.3%, and 2.0%, respectively. In semantic segmentation, our method achieved an F1score of 89.54%, an overall accuracy (OA) of 97.73%, and an intersection over union (IoU) of 81.06%, outperforming all other bounding-box-supervised methods, image tag–supervised methods, and most scribble-supervised methods. It also demonstrated competitive performance compared to fully supervised methods and scribble-supervised methods. SAM integration further boosts performance, yielding an F1score of 90.55%, OA of 97.84%, and IoU of 82.73%. Our approach's efficacy extends to the Waterloo Building and xBD Data Sets, achieving an OA of 98.48%, IoU of 84.72%, and F1score of 91.73% for the former and an OA of 97.32%, IoU of 60.10%, and F1score of 75.08% for the latter. These results underscore the method's robustness and cost-effectiveness in rooftop delineation across diverse data sets.

            This study assesses two techniques for generating point clouds based on dense image matching (DIM): semiglobal matching (SGM) implemented in Trimble INPHO MATCH-3DX software, and a deep-learning algorithm Pyramid Stereo Matching Network (PSMNet). The PSMNet was trained using three datasets with both automated driving and aerial scenes. Two other distinctive sites were selected to assess the accuracy against LiDAR data. The study found inaccuracies in the PSMNet point clouds and suggested that SGM could potentially result in a better outcome. However, for flat slab or ground surface, its root-mean-square error is better than SGM. The analysis showed that the SGM analyses favorably remove points on vertical surfaces due to occlusion, while PSMNet incorrectly extrapolate them with slopes. Furthermore, the assessment identified the potential to improve PSMNet by using more or in-distribution training dataset for test (unseen) areas.

            Vanishing points provide geometric information about a scene and assist in camera calibration, scene understanding, and 3D reconstruction. The random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm faces challenges of low efficiency and insufficient robustness. With prior information, the Bayesian sample consensus (BaySAC) algorithm can efficiently derive the correct parameters and compensate for the deficiencies of the RANSAC algorithm. This study proposes an improved BaySAC vanish - ing point detection algorithm, which uses a linear grouping strategy to enhance the distribution of inliers across groups and accelerate convergence. In the continuous frame vanishing point tracking problem, the detection result of the previous frame is employed as a priori infor - mation for the subsequent frames, facilitating efficient convergence for vanishing point detection and tracking in videos. Experimental results on both benchmark datasets and real-world image sets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves remarkable accuracy and efficiency, enabling real-time performance for vanishing point detection and track- ing. The code is available at https://github. com/CHEMYE/BaySAC.

            Forest fires have a profound influence on the economy, ecology, and environment. Realizing the potential of remote sensing in forest fire management, a study was taken up to investigate the spatiotemporal behavior of active forest fires in a mountainous terrain of Uttarakhand State, north India, using 15 years' time-series historical MODIS (C6) active fire point products. Results indicate an over-all fire incidence detection accuracy of 62.3% with a KHAT value of 0.59. Moreover, a regular trend in intra-annual behavior in fire incidences with peaks during the hot and dry period of the year was observed and a large year-to-year variability in fire regimes with no significant trends over time could be noticed. The approach and results are discussed in detail along with the future perspective.

            Accurate individual tree segmentation, which is important for forestry investigation, is still a difficult and challenging task. In this study, we developed a climbing algorithm and combined it with a deep learning model to extract forests and achieve individual tree segmentation using lidar point clouds. We tested the algorithm on mixed forests within complex environments scanned by unmanned aircraft system lidar in ecological restoration mining areas along the Yangtze River of China. Quantitative assessments of the segmentation results showed that the forest extraction achieved a kappa coefficient of 0.88, and the individual tree segmentation results achieved F-scores ranging from 0.86 to 1. The climbing algorithm successfully reduced false positives and false negatives with the increased crown overlapping and outperformed the widely used top-down region-growing point cloud segmentation method. The results indicate that the climbing algorithm proposed in this study will help solve the overlapped crown problem of tree segmentation under complex environments.

            As global trade and maritime traffic develop, exploring ship detection in remote sensing images has become a research hotspot. However, ships in remote sensing images are so small that it leads to a high detection leakage rate and excessive model parameters, making them difficult to apply on remote sensing equipment with limited resources. To address the challenge, we propose a light-weight ship object detection algorithm, adaptive layered multi-scale You Only Look Once version 8 (ALM-YOLOv8), based on multi-scale perception and feature enhancement. To enhance the model's perception of contextual information in complex backgrounds, a multi-scale channel fusion module is constructed to extract features of various scales. To enhance the extracted features, a small-object detection layer and a dynamic channel attention convolution that assigns dynamic weights are proposed. Additionally, this study embeds the large separable kernel attention mechanism into the original network, which lightens the model. Experiments on the HRSC2016 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of ALM-YOLOv8.

            The security of the transmission line corridor is an important guar- antee for the sustainable supply of electricity and an important prerequisite for the rapid development of the economy. Transmission corridors located in high mountains and valleys are often threatened by geological disasters, which seriously affect their stable operation. This research investigates the landslide in the Kunming transmission corridor using 79 Sentinel-1A SAR images from July 2020 to October 2021. Using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) methods, deformation changes before the landslide are analyzed. Factors like precipitation, lithology, and vegetation coverage demonstrate a correlation with landslide occurrence. Seasonal variations in deformation were related to precipitation. The landslide's primary causes are attributed to precipitation, carbonate karstification, and vegetation coverage. Ultimately, this research establishes a correlation between deformation changes and influencing factors in the Kunming transmission corridor, contributing to a deeper understanding of landslide evolution and ensuring the corridor's security for sustainable electricity supply and economic development.

            Object detection is crucial to extracting and analyzing information autonomously from high-resolution remote sensing images (HRSIs). To address ideal blocking for large-scale  HRSI object detection, this study uses a novel adaptive orientation object-detection method for largescale HRSIs based on multi-scale block fusion. An adaptive orientation object-detection  framework based on a convolutional neural network is applied to detect diverse objects of large-scale HRSIs through different block scales; average precision (AP) values of diverse object  detection results are calculated at different block scales. Then, block scales matching the largest AP values of diverse objects are determined based on statistical results of the AP  values of the diverse object at different block scales. Finally, object-detection results at block scales matching the largest AP values of diverse objects are fused by the non-maximum  suppression algorithm to achieve large-scale HRSI object-detection results. Experimental findings reveal that the proposed method is better than any single block-scale object-detection  method, resulting in satisfactory large-scale HRSI object-detection results.

            In recent years, with the gradual increase of neural network Params (the aggregate of trainable elements in a model, including weights, biases, and other adjustable elements)  and calculation volume, model compression within an acceptable range of network accuracy variations has emerged as a prominent research focus in the field of deep learning. Model  pruning and knowledge distillation have been widely used for reducing the complexity and storage cost of neural networks. This study designs the Remote Sensing Object Detection Network  (RSODNet), a lightweight model for remote sensing image object detection, and proposes bridging cross-task distillation network slimming (BCDNS) as a method that integrates model pruning and  knowledge distillation. The experiment results indicate that RSODNet outperforms the YOLOv8 model in various metrics while maintaining almost unchanged Params and calculation volume. The  BCDNS method eliminates redundant channels while preserving a priori knowledge of the initial model intact. This study offers technical support for compressed models used in object detection  from remote sensing images

            Earthquakes deposit loose materials in gullies, making seismic mountain gorges prone to landslides and debris flows. Monitoring and predicting ground deformation in these areas is essential. This study introduces a CS-Elman prediction model based on SBAS-InSAR monitoring. SBAS-InSAR technology analyzes 36 Sentinel-1A im- ages from Wenchuan County, Sichuan Province, China (June 2021 to October 2023), focusing on deformation areas and precipitation data. The CS algorithm optimizes the Elman network's parameters, using SBAS-InSAR data as training samples. Validation shows that: (1) Wenchuan County experiences varied deformation, with Banzi Gully in Miansi Town showing the highest uplift at 183.74 mm/a due to heavy rain. (2) As sample size increases, prediction error decreases and accuracy improves. Predictions suggest ongo- ing uplift at about 4.50 mm per month above Cutou Gully over the next four months, highlighting the need for continued monitoring.

            This study proposes an automated tailings pond-detection method based on the YOLOv8-RVSW model to address the limitations of traditional surveys. A tailings pond dataset was created using high-resolution satellite images, and data quality was improved through data augmentation techniques. In the model, YOLOv8's backbone feature network was replaced with RepViT to effectively capture global and local information. Additionally, the C2f module was enhanced to QuadraSE_C2f to focus on essential feature channels, and WIoUv3 was used as the loss function to improve object localization and detection accuracy. Experimental results indicate that compared with the original model, accuracy increased by 3.9% to 97.4%, recall improved by 4.9% to 96.3%, and mean average precision rose by 2.4% to 98.5%. This method significantly enhances the automation and intelligence of tailings pond monitoring, providing an effective tool for emergency monitoring.

            In recent years, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) vehicle detection has become a research hotspot. However, algorithms using horizontal bounding boxes can lead to redundant detection areas due to the varying aspect ratio and arbitrary orientation of vehicle targets. This paper proposes a morphology-based feature extraction network (MFE-Net), which fully uses the prior shape knowledge of the vehicle targets. Specifically, we adopt rotatable bounding boxes to predict the targets, and a novel rectangular rotation-invariant coordinate convolution (RRICC) is proposed to extract the feature, which can determine more accurately the convolutional sampling location of the vehicles. The adaptive thresholding denoising module (ATDM) is designed to suppress background clutter. Furthermore, inspired by the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and self-attention, we propose the hybrid representation enhancement module (HREM) to highlight the vehicle target features. The experiment results show that the proposed model obtains an average precision (AP) of 93.1% on the SAR vehicle detection data set (SVDD).

            The spatial and spectral features of hyperspectral images exhibit complementarity, and neglecting them prevents the full exploitation of useful information for superresolution. This article proposes a spatial-spectral middle cross-attention fusion network to explore the spatial-spectral structure correlation. Initially, we learn spatial and spectral features through spatial and spectral branches instead of single ones to reduce information compression. Then, a novel middle-cross attention fusion block that includes middle features fusion strategy and cross-attention is proposed to fuse spatial-spectral features to enhance their mutual effects, which aims to explore the spatial-spectral structural correlations. Finally, we propose a spectral feature compensation mechanism to provide complementary information for adjacent band groups. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in object values and visual quality.

            Neural networks have greatly promoted the development of hyperspectral unmixing (HU). Most data-driven deep networks extract features of hyperspectral images (HSIs) by stacking convolutional layers to achieve endmember extraction and abundance estimation. Some model-driven networks have strong interpretability but fail to mine the deep feature. We propose a variable-iterative fully convolutional neural network (VIFCNN) for sparse unmixing, combining the characteristics of these two networks. Under the model-driven iterative framework guided by sparse unmixing by variable splitting and augmented lagrangian (SUnSAL), a data-driven spatial-spectral feature learning module and a spatial information updating module are introduced to enhance the learning of data information. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets show that VIFCNN significantly outperforms several traditional unmixing methods and two deep learning-based methods. On real datasets, our method improves signal-to-reconstruction error by 17.38%, reduces abundance root-mean-square error by 25.24%, and reduces abundance spectral angle distance by 31.40% compared with U-ADMM-ßUNet.

            Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) automatic target recognition (ATR) models based on deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to adversarial attacks. In this study, we proposed an SAR black-box local adversarial attack algorithm named attention heat map- based black-box local adversarial attack (AH-BLAA). First, we designed an attention heat map extraction module combined with the layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) algorithm to obtain the high concerning areas of the SAR-ATR models. Then, to gener- ate SAR adversarial attack examples, we designed a perturbation generator module, introducing the structural dissimilarity (DSSIM) metric in the loss function to limit image distortion and the dif- ferential evolution (DE) algorithm to search for optimal perturba- tions. Experimental results on the MSTAR and FUSAR-Ship datasets showed that compared with existing adversarial attack algorithms, the attack success rate of the AH-BLAA algorithm increased by 0.63% to 33.59% and 1.05% to 17.65%, respectively. Moreover, the low- est perturbation ratios reached 0.23% and 0.13%, respectively.

            Responding to the shortcomings of China's civil remote sensing data in land cover classification, such as the difficulty of data acquisition and the low utilization rate, we used Landsat-8, China Orbita Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral remote sensing (OHS) data, and Landsat-8 + OHS data combined with band (red, green, and blue) and vegetation index features to classify land cover using maximum likelihood (ML), Mahalanobis distance (MD), and support vector machine (SVM). The results show that Landsat-8 + OHS data have the highest classification accuracy in SVM, with an overall accuracy of 83.52% and a kappa coefficient of 0.71, and this result is higher than that of Landsat-8 images and OHS images separately. In addition, the classification accuracy of OHS images was higher than that of Landsat-8 images. The results of the study provide a reference for the use of civil satellite remote sensing data in China.

            Teacher-Student Prototype Enhancement Network for a Few-Shot Remote Sensing Scene Classification

            Few-shot remote sensing scene classification identifies new classes from limited labeled samples where the great challenges are intraclass diversity, interclass similarity, and limited supervision. To alleviate these problems, a teacher-student prototype enhancement network is proposed for a few-shot remote sensing scene classification. Instead of introducing an attentional mechanism in mainstream studies, a prototype enhancement module is recommended to adaptively select high-confidence query samples, which can enhance the support prototype representations to emphasize intraclass and interclass relationships. The construction of a few-shot teacher model generates more discriminative predictive representations with inputs from many labeled samples, thus providing a strong supervisory signal to the student model and encouraging the network to achieve accurate classification with a limited number of labeled samples. Extensive experiments of four public datasets, including NWPU-remote sens ing image scene classification (NWPU-RESISC45), aerial image dataset (AID), UC Merced, and WHU-RS19, demonstrate that this method achieves superior competitive performance than the state-of-the-art methods on five-way, one-shot, and five-shot classifications.

            Crane automation requires a three-dimensional (3D) map around cranes that should be reconstructed and updated quickly.In this study, a high-precision classification method was developed to distinguish stationary objects from moving objects in moving images captured by a monocular camera to stabilize 3D reconstruction. To develop the method, a moving image was captured while the crane was slewed with a monocular camera mounted vertically downward at the tip of the crane. The boom length and angle data were output from a control device, a controller area network. For efficient development, a simulator that imitated the environment of an actual machine was developed and used. The proposed method uses optical flow to track feature points. The classification was performed successfully, independent of derricking motion. Consequently, the proposed method contributes to stable 3D mapping around cranes in construction sites.

            Point cloud semantic segmentation is a key step in 3D scene understanding and analysis. In recent years, deep learning–based point cloud semantic segmentation methods have received extensive attention from researchers. Multi-scale neighborhood feature learning methods are suitable for inhomogeneous density point clouds, but different scale branching feature learning increases the computational complexity and makes it difficult to accurately fuse different scale features to express local information. In this study, a point cloud semantic segmentation network based on RandLA-Net with multi-scale local feature aggregation and adaptive fusion is proposed. The designed structure can reduce computational complexity and accurately express local features. The mean intersection-over-union is improved by 1.1% on the SemanticKITTI data set with an inference speed of nine frames per second, while the mean intersection-over-union is improved by 0.9% on the S3DIS data set, compared with RandLA-Net. We also conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the proposed key structure.

            Star identification algorithms can be applied to resident space object (RSO) surveillance, which includes a large number of stars and false stars. This paper proposes an efficient, robust star identification algorithm for RSO surveillance based on a neural network. First, a feature called equal-frequency binning radial feature (EFB-RF) is proposed for guide stars, and a superficial neural network is constructed for feature classification. Then the training set is generated based on EFB-RF. Finally, the remaining stars are identified using a residual star matching method. The simulation experiment and results show that the identification rate of our algorithm can reach 99.82% under 1 pixel position noise, and it can reach 99.54% under 5% false stars. When the percentage of missing stars is 15%, it can reach 99.40%. The algorithm is verified by RSO surveillance.

            In this paper, wavelets are applied to develop new models for the self-calibration of aerial metric camera systems. It is well known and mathematically proven that additional parameters (APs) can compensate image distortions and remaining error sources by a rigorous photogrammetric bundle-block adjustment. Thus, kernel functions based on orthogonal wavelets (e. g., asymmetric Daubechies wave- lets, least asymmetric Daubechies wavelets, Battle-Lemarié wavelets, Meyer wavelets) are used to build the wavelets-based family of APs for self-calibrating digital frame cameras. These new APs are called wavelet APs. Its applications in rigorous tests are accomplished by using aerial images taken by an airborne digital mapping camera in situ and practical calibrations. The test results demonstrate that these orthogonal wavelet APs are applicable and largely avoid the risk of over-parameterization. Their external accuracy is evaluated using reliable and high precision check points in the calibration field.

            The aging condition of asphalt pavement is an invaluable basis for traffic infrastructure evaluation. Due to the amount of time and high cost of monitoring and identifying asphalt pavement aging, many current studies focus on satellite remote sensing methods. In this paper, some methods and technologies for monitoring asphalt pavement degradation by optical satellite remote sensing are introduced as a literature review. Many researchers have developed spectrum libraries based on the actual aging of asphalt pavements, and it is possible to construct pavement health indices based on spectrum changes. Some indexes can extract different aging degrees of asphalt pavement from optical satellite images. Of course, current research can only preliminarily reflect the aging phenomenon of asphalt pavement and cannot accurately describe the distress characteristics of asphalt pavement. Future research needs to further strengthen mechanism research, develop higher resolution images, improve image processing technology, and adopt multi-means fusion analysis methods.

            High‐resolution remote sensing images can support machine learning methods to achieve remarkable results in agricultural monitoring. However, traditional supervised learning methods require pre-labeled training data and are unsuitable for non-fully labeled areas. Positive and Unlabeled Learning (PUL), can deal with unlabeled data. A loss function PU-Loss was proposed in this study to directly optimize the PUL evaluation metric and to address the data imbalance problem caused by unlabeled positive samples. Moreover, a hybrid normalization module Batch Instance-Layer Normalization was proposed to perform multiple normalization methods based on the resolution size and to improve the model performance further. A real‐world positive and unlabeled winter wheat data set was used to evaluate the proposed method, which outperformed widely used models such as U‐Net, DeepLabv3+, and DA‐Net. The results demonstrated the potential of PUL for winter wheat identification in remote sensing images.

            Shadows in remote sensing images contain crucial information about various features on the ground. In this study, a method for detecting building shadows in GF‐2 images based on improved quick shift was proposed. First, six feature variables were constructed: first principal component (PC1), brightness component (I), normalized difference shadow index (NDSI), morphological shadow index (MSI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Then, the image was segmented to obtain homogeneous objects, which were then classified using a random forest model. Two improvements were added to the quick shift algorithm: using PC1, I, and MSI as input data instead of RGB images; and adding Canny edge constraints. Validation in six research areas yields Kappa coefficients of 0.928, 0.896, 0.89, 0.913, 0.879, and 0.909, confirming method feasibility. In addition, comparative experiments demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness across different land cover types while mitigating the segmentation scale effect.

            The study explores the potential of next-generation satellite hyperspectral imaging systems for screening and predicting surface‐soil contamination and degradation by exploiting various spectral indices and signature‐matching techniques at a heavily industrialized area in India. The soil moisture content, desertification and salinity status, clay or fine material content, heavy metal content, vegetation health status, and stress levels were assessed from continuum-removed spectral reflectance values. Results indicated the presence of water in two tailings ponds, high salinity, and desertification values in most of the tailings ponds and dump sites, clay boundary liner along four ponds, high heavy metal indices along three ponds and all dump sites, highly stressed vegetation near all tailings ponds and coal dump sites, and pollutants in nearby water channels. The results suggest a strategy for the initial identification of priority areas for ground-based investigations and an alternative rapid methodology to monitor large industrial hubs in India.

            Remote sensing applications require high-resolution images to obtain precise information about the Earth???s surface. Multispectral images have high spatial resolution but low spectral resolution. Hyperspectral images have high spectral resolution but low spatial resolution. This study proposes a residual learning and attention-based parallel network based on residual network and channel attention. The network performs image fusion of a high spatial resolution multispectral image and a low spatial resolution hyperspectral image. The network training and fusion experiments are conducted on four public benchmark data sets to show the effectiveness of the proposed model. The fusion performance is compared with classical signal processing-based image fusion techniques. Four image metrics are used for the quantitative evaluation of the fused images. The proposed network improved fusion ability by reducing the root mean square error and relative dimensionless global error in synthesis and increased the peak signal-to-noise ratio when compared to other state-of-the-art models.

In 2022, compared with 2020, conflict zones exhibited reduced improvement and increased slight degradation, whereas nonconflict areas showed marginal enhancement. Through propensity score matching, the research confirmed the causal relationship between conflict and ecological trends. Pathway analysis revealed that the conflict contributed to 0.016 units increase in ecological quality while reducing the improvement rate by 0.042 units. This study provides empirical support for understanding the correlation between conflicts and specific environmental factors, offering technical references for ecological quality assessments in other conflict areas and future evaluations by the Ukrainian government.

            Remote sensing has been applied to observe large areas of surface water to obtain higher-resolution and long-term continuous observation records of surface water. However, limitations remain in the detection of large-scale and multi-temporal surface water mainly due to the high variability in water surface signatures in space and time. In this study, we developed a surface water remote sensing information extraction model that integrates spectral and temporal characteristics to extract surface water from multi-dimensional data of long-term Landsat scenes to explore the spatiotemporal changes in surface water over decades. The goal is to extract open water in vegetation, clouds, terrain shadows, and other land cover backgrounds from medium-resolution remote sensing images. The average overall accuracy and average kappa coefficient of the classification were verified to be 0.91 and 0.81, respectively. Experiments applied to China’s inland arid area have shown that the method is effective under complex surface environmental conditions.
