            Forest fires have a profound influence on the economy, ecology, and environment. Realizing the potential of remote sensing in forest fire management, a study was taken up to investigate the spatiotemporal behavior of active forest fires in a mountainous terrain of Uttarakhand State, north India, using 15 years' time-series historical MODIS (C6) active fire point products. Results indicate an over-all fire incidence detection accuracy of 62.3% with a KHAT value of 0.59. Moreover, a regular trend in intra-annual behavior in fire incidences with peaks during the hot and dry period of the year was observed and a large year-to-year variability in fire regimes with no significant trends over time could be noticed. The approach and results are discussed in detail along with the future perspective.

            Accurate individual tree segmentation, which is important for forestry investigation, is still a difficult and challenging task. In this study, we developed a climbing algorithm and combined it with a deep learning model to extract forests and achieve individual tree segmentation using lidar point clouds. We tested the algorithm on mixed forests within complex environments scanned by unmanned aircraft system lidar in ecological restoration mining areas along the Yangtze River of China. Quantitative assessments of the segmentation results showed that the forest extraction achieved a kappa coefficient of 0.88, and the individual tree segmentation results achieved F-scores ranging from 0.86 to 1. The climbing algorithm successfully reduced false positives and false negatives with the increased crown overlapping and outperformed the widely used top-down region-growing point cloud segmentation method. The results indicate that the climbing algorithm proposed in this study will help solve the overlapped crown problem of tree segmentation under complex environments.

            As global trade and maritime traffic develop, exploring ship detection in remote sensing images has become a research hotspot. However, ships in remote sensing images are so small that it leads to a high detection leakage rate and excessive model parameters, making them difficult to apply on remote sensing equipment with limited resources. To address the challenge, we propose a light-weight ship object detection algorithm, adaptive layered multi-scale You Only Look Once version 8 (ALM-YOLOv8), based on multi-scale perception and feature enhancement. To enhance the model's perception of contextual information in complex backgrounds, a multi-scale channel fusion module is constructed to extract features of various scales. To enhance the extracted features, a small-object detection layer and a dynamic channel attention convolution that assigns dynamic weights are proposed. Additionally, this study embeds the large separable kernel attention mechanism into the original network, which lightens the model. Experiments on the HRSC2016 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of ALM-YOLOv8.

            The security of the transmission line corridor is an important guar- antee for the sustainable supply of electricity and an important prerequisite for the rapid development of the economy. Transmission corridors located in high mountains and valleys are often threatened by geological disasters, which seriously affect their stable operation. This research investigates the landslide in the Kunming transmission corridor using 79 Sentinel-1A SAR images from July 2020 to October 2021. Using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) methods, deformation changes before the landslide are analyzed. Factors like precipitation, lithology, and vegetation coverage demonstrate a correlation with landslide occurrence. Seasonal variations in deformation were related to precipitation. The landslide's primary causes are attributed to precipitation, carbonate karstification, and vegetation coverage. Ultimately, this research establishes a correlation between deformation changes and influencing factors in the Kunming transmission corridor, contributing to a deeper understanding of landslide evolution and ensuring the corridor's security for sustainable electricity supply and economic development.

            Object detection is crucial to extracting and analyzing information autonomously from high-resolution remote sensing images (HRSIs). To address ideal blocking for large-scale  HRSI object detection, this study uses a novel adaptive orientation object-detection method for largescale HRSIs based on multi-scale block fusion. An adaptive orientation object-detection  framework based on a convolutional neural network is applied to detect diverse objects of large-scale HRSIs through different block scales; average precision (AP) values of diverse object  detection results are calculated at different block scales. Then, block scales matching the largest AP values of diverse objects are determined based on statistical results of the AP  values of the diverse object at different block scales. Finally, object-detection results at block scales matching the largest AP values of diverse objects are fused by the non-maximum  suppression algorithm to achieve large-scale HRSI object-detection results. Experimental findings reveal that the proposed method is better than any single block-scale object-detection  method, resulting in satisfactory large-scale HRSI object-detection results.

            In recent years, with the gradual increase of neural network Params (the aggregate of trainable elements in a model, including weights, biases, and other adjustable elements)  and calculation volume, model compression within an acceptable range of network accuracy variations has emerged as a prominent research focus in the field of deep learning. Model  pruning and knowledge distillation have been widely used for reducing the complexity and storage cost of neural networks. This study designs the Remote Sensing Object Detection Network  (RSODNet), a lightweight model for remote sensing image object detection, and proposes bridging cross-task distillation network slimming (BCDNS) as a method that integrates model pruning and  knowledge distillation. The experiment results indicate that RSODNet outperforms the YOLOv8 model in various metrics while maintaining almost unchanged Params and calculation volume. The  BCDNS method eliminates redundant channels while preserving a priori knowledge of the initial model intact. This study offers technical support for compressed models used in object detection  from remote sensing images

            Earthquakes deposit loose materials in gullies, making seismic mountain gorges prone to landslides and debris flows. Monitoring and predicting ground deformation in these areas is essential. This study introduces a CS-Elman prediction model based on SBAS-InSAR monitoring. SBAS-InSAR technology analyzes 36 Sentinel-1A im- ages from Wenchuan County, Sichuan Province, China (June 2021 to October 2023), focusing on deformation areas and precipitation data. The CS algorithm optimizes the Elman network's parameters, using SBAS-InSAR data as training samples. Validation shows that: (1) Wenchuan County experiences varied deformation, with Banzi Gully in Miansi Town showing the highest uplift at 183.74 mm/a due to heavy rain. (2) As sample size increases, prediction error decreases and accuracy improves. Predictions suggest ongo- ing uplift at about 4.50 mm per month above Cutou Gully over the next four months, highlighting the need for continued monitoring.

            This study proposes an automated tailings pond-detection method based on the YOLOv8-RVSW model to address the limitations of traditional surveys. A tailings pond dataset was created using high-resolution satellite images, and data quality was improved through data augmentation techniques. In the model, YOLOv8's backbone feature network was replaced with RepViT to effectively capture global and local information. Additionally, the C2f module was enhanced to QuadraSE_C2f to focus on essential feature channels, and WIoUv3 was used as the loss function to improve object localization and detection accuracy. Experimental results indicate that compared with the original model, accuracy increased by 3.9% to 97.4%, recall improved by 4.9% to 96.3%, and mean average precision rose by 2.4% to 98.5%. This method significantly enhances the automation and intelligence of tailings pond monitoring, providing an effective tool for emergency monitoring.

            In recent years, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) vehicle detection has become a research hotspot. However, algorithms using horizontal bounding boxes can lead to redundant detection areas due to the varying aspect ratio and arbitrary orientation of vehicle targets. This paper proposes a morphology-based feature extraction network (MFE-Net), which fully uses the prior shape knowledge of the vehicle targets. Specifically, we adopt rotatable bounding boxes to predict the targets, and a novel rectangular rotation-invariant coordinate convolution (RRICC) is proposed to extract the feature, which can determine more accurately the convolutional sampling location of the vehicles. The adaptive thresholding denoising module (ATDM) is designed to suppress background clutter. Furthermore, inspired by the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and self-attention, we propose the hybrid representation enhancement module (HREM) to highlight the vehicle target features. The experiment results show that the proposed model obtains an average precision (AP) of 93.1% on the SAR vehicle detection data set (SVDD).

            The spatial and spectral features of hyperspectral images exhibit complementarity, and neglecting them prevents the full exploitation of useful information for superresolution. This article proposes a spatial-spectral middle cross-attention fusion network to explore the spatial-spectral structure correlation. Initially, we learn spatial and spectral features through spatial and spectral branches instead of single ones to reduce information compression. Then, a novel middle-cross attention fusion block that includes middle features fusion strategy and cross-attention is proposed to fuse spatial-spectral features to enhance their mutual effects, which aims to explore the spatial-spectral structural correlations. Finally, we propose a spectral feature compensation mechanism to provide complementary information for adjacent band groups. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in object values and visual quality.

            Neural networks have greatly promoted the development of hyperspectral unmixing (HU). Most data-driven deep networks extract features of hyperspectral images (HSIs) by stacking convolutional layers to achieve endmember extraction and abundance estimation. Some model-driven networks have strong interpretability but fail to mine the deep feature. We propose a variable-iterative fully convolutional neural network (VIFCNN) for sparse unmixing, combining the characteristics of these two networks. Under the model-driven iterative framework guided by sparse unmixing by variable splitting and augmented lagrangian (SUnSAL), a data-driven spatial-spectral feature learning module and a spatial information updating module are introduced to enhance the learning of data information. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets show that VIFCNN significantly outperforms several traditional unmixing methods and two deep learning-based methods. On real datasets, our method improves signal-to-reconstruction error by 17.38%, reduces abundance root-mean-square error by 25.24%, and reduces abundance spectral angle distance by 31.40% compared with U-ADMM-ßUNet.

            Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) automatic target recognition (ATR) models based on deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to adversarial attacks. In this study, we proposed an SAR black-box local adversarial attack algorithm named attention heat map- based black-box local adversarial attack (AH-BLAA). First, we designed an attention heat map extraction module combined with the layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) algorithm to obtain the high concerning areas of the SAR-ATR models. Then, to gener- ate SAR adversarial attack examples, we designed a perturbation generator module, introducing the structural dissimilarity (DSSIM) metric in the loss function to limit image distortion and the dif- ferential evolution (DE) algorithm to search for optimal perturba- tions. Experimental results on the MSTAR and FUSAR-Ship datasets showed that compared with existing adversarial attack algorithms, the attack success rate of the AH-BLAA algorithm increased by 0.63% to 33.59% and 1.05% to 17.65%, respectively. Moreover, the low- est perturbation ratios reached 0.23% and 0.13%, respectively.

            Responding to the shortcomings of China's civil remote sensing data in land cover classification, such as the difficulty of data acquisition and the low utilization rate, we used Landsat-8, China Orbita Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral remote sensing (OHS) data, and Landsat-8 + OHS data combined with band (red, green, and blue) and vegetation index features to classify land cover using maximum likelihood (ML), Mahalanobis distance (MD), and support vector machine (SVM). The results show that Landsat-8 + OHS data have the highest classification accuracy in SVM, with an overall accuracy of 83.52% and a kappa coefficient of 0.71, and this result is higher than that of Landsat-8 images and OHS images separately. In addition, the classification accuracy of OHS images was higher than that of Landsat-8 images. The results of the study provide a reference for the use of civil satellite remote sensing data in China.

            Few-shot remote sensing scene classification identifies new classes from limited labeled samples where the great challenges are intraclass diversity, interclass similarity, and limited supervision. To alleviate these problems, a teacher-student prototype enhancement network is proposed for a few-shot remote sensing scene classification. Instead of introducing an attentional mechanism in mainstream studies, a prototype enhancement module is recommended to adaptively select high-confidence query samples, which can enhance the support prototype representations to emphasize intraclass and interclass relationships. The construction of a few-shot teacher model generates more discriminative predictive representations with inputs from many labeled samples, thus providing a strong supervisory signal to the student model and encouraging the network to achieve accurate classification with a limited number of labeled samples. Extensive experiments of four public datasets, including NWPU-remote sens ing image scene classification (NWPU-RESISC45), aerial image dataset (AID), UC Merced, and WHU-RS19, demonstrate that this method achieves superior competitive performance than the state-of-the-art methods on five-way, one-shot, and five-shot classifications.

            Crane automation requires a three-dimensional (3D) map around cranes that should be reconstructed and updated quickly.In this study, a high-precision classification method was developed to distinguish stationary objects from moving objects in moving images captured by a monocular camera to stabilize 3D reconstruction. To develop the method, a moving image was captured while the crane was slewed with a monocular camera mounted vertically downward at the tip of the crane. The boom length and angle data were output from a control device, a controller area network. For efficient development, a simulator that imitated the environment of an actual machine was developed and used. The proposed method uses optical flow to track feature points. The classification was performed successfully, independent of derricking motion. Consequently, the proposed method contributes to stable 3D mapping around cranes in construction sites.

            Point cloud semantic segmentation is a key step in 3D scene understanding and analysis. In recent years, deep learning–based point cloud semantic segmentation methods have received extensive attention from researchers. Multi-scale neighborhood feature learning methods are suitable for inhomogeneous density point clouds, but different scale branching feature learning increases the computational complexity and makes it difficult to accurately fuse different scale features to express local information. In this study, a point cloud semantic segmentation network based on RandLA-Net with multi-scale local feature aggregation and adaptive fusion is proposed. The designed structure can reduce computational complexity and accurately express local features. The mean intersection-over-union is improved by 1.1% on the SemanticKITTI data set with an inference speed of nine frames per second, while the mean intersection-over-union is improved by 0.9% on the S3DIS data set, compared with RandLA-Net. We also conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the proposed key structure.

            Star identification algorithms can be applied to resident space object (RSO) surveillance, which includes a large number of stars and false stars. This paper proposes an efficient, robust star identification algorithm for RSO surveillance based on a neural network. First, a feature called equal-frequency binning radial feature (EFB-RF) is proposed for guide stars, and a superficial neural network is constructed for feature classification. Then the training set is generated based on EFB-RF. Finally, the remaining stars are identified using a residual star matching method. The simulation experiment and results show that the identification rate of our algorithm can reach 99.82% under 1 pixel position noise, and it can reach 99.54% under 5% false stars. When the percentage of missing stars is 15%, it can reach 99.40%. The algorithm is verified by RSO surveillance.

            In this paper, wavelets are applied to develop new models for the self-calibration of aerial metric camera systems. It is well known and mathematically proven that additional parameters (APs) can compensate image distortions and remaining error sources by a rigorous photogrammetric bundle-block adjustment. Thus, kernel functions based on orthogonal wavelets (e. g., asymmetric Daubechies wave- lets, least asymmetric Daubechies wavelets, Battle-Lemarié wavelets, Meyer wavelets) are used to build the wavelets-based family of APs for self-calibrating digital frame cameras. These new APs are called wavelet APs. Its applications in rigorous tests are accomplished by using aerial images taken by an airborne digital mapping camera in situ and practical calibrations. The test results demonstrate that these orthogonal wavelet APs are applicable and largely avoid the risk of over-parameterization. Their external accuracy is evaluated using reliable and high precision check points in the calibration field.

            The aging condition of asphalt pavement is an invaluable basis for traffic infrastructure evaluation. Due to the amount of time and high cost of monitoring and identifying asphalt pavement aging, many current studies focus on satellite remote sensing methods. In this paper, some methods and technologies for monitoring asphalt pavement degradation by optical satellite remote sensing are introduced as a literature review. Many researchers have developed spectrum libraries based on the actual aging of asphalt pavements, and it is possible to construct pavement health indices based on spectrum changes. Some indexes can extract different aging degrees of asphalt pavement from optical satellite images. Of course, current research can only preliminarily reflect the aging phenomenon of asphalt pavement and cannot accurately describe the distress characteristics of asphalt pavement. Future research needs to further strengthen mechanism research, develop higher resolution images, improve image processing technology, and adopt multi-means fusion analysis methods.

            High‐resolution remote sensing images can support machine learning methods to achieve remarkable results in agricultural monitoring. However, traditional supervised learning methods require pre-labeled training data and are unsuitable for non-fully labeled areas. Positive and Unlabeled Learning (PUL), can deal with unlabeled data. A loss function PU-Loss was proposed in this study to directly optimize the PUL evaluation metric and to address the data imbalance problem caused by unlabeled positive samples. Moreover, a hybrid normalization module Batch Instance-Layer Normalization was proposed to perform multiple normalization methods based on the resolution size and to improve the model performance further. A real‐world positive and unlabeled winter wheat data set was used to evaluate the proposed method, which outperformed widely used models such as U‐Net, DeepLabv3+, and DA‐Net. The results demonstrated the potential of PUL for winter wheat identification in remote sensing images.

            Shadows in remote sensing images contain crucial information about various features on the ground. In this study, a method for detecting building shadows in GF‐2 images based on improved quick shift was proposed. First, six feature variables were constructed: first principal component (PC1), brightness component (I), normalized difference shadow index (NDSI), morphological shadow index (MSI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Then, the image was segmented to obtain homogeneous objects, which were then classified using a random forest model. Two improvements were added to the quick shift algorithm: using PC1, I, and MSI as input data instead of RGB images; and adding Canny edge constraints. Validation in six research areas yields Kappa coefficients of 0.928, 0.896, 0.89, 0.913, 0.879, and 0.909, confirming method feasibility. In addition, comparative experiments demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness across different land cover types while mitigating the segmentation scale effect.

            The study explores the potential of next-generation satellite hyperspectral imaging systems for screening and predicting surface‐soil contamination and degradation by exploiting various spectral indices and signature‐matching techniques at a heavily industrialized area in India. The soil moisture content, desertification and salinity status, clay or fine material content, heavy metal content, vegetation health status, and stress levels were assessed from continuum-removed spectral reflectance values. Results indicated the presence of water in two tailings ponds, high salinity, and desertification values in most of the tailings ponds and dump sites, clay boundary liner along four ponds, high heavy metal indices along three ponds and all dump sites, highly stressed vegetation near all tailings ponds and coal dump sites, and pollutants in nearby water channels. The results suggest a strategy for the initial identification of priority areas for ground-based investigations and an alternative rapid methodology to monitor large industrial hubs in India.

            Remote sensing applications require high-resolution images to obtain precise information about the Earth???s surface. Multispectral images have high spatial resolution but low spectral resolution. Hyperspectral images have high spectral resolution but low spatial resolution. This study proposes a residual learning and attention-based parallel network based on residual network and channel attention. The network performs image fusion of a high spatial resolution multispectral image and a low spatial resolution hyperspectral image. The network training and fusion experiments are conducted on four public benchmark data sets to show the effectiveness of the proposed model. The fusion performance is compared with classical signal processing-based image fusion techniques. Four image metrics are used for the quantitative evaluation of the fused images. The proposed network improved fusion ability by reducing the root mean square error and relative dimensionless global error in synthesis and increased the peak signal-to-noise ratio when compared to other state-of-the-art models.

            To evaluate the spatiotemporal changes in the ecological environment of eastern Ukraine since the Russia-Ukraine conflict, this study used MODIS images from March to September 2020 and 2022 to calculate the Remote Sensing-Based Ecological Index. In 2022, compared with 2020, conflict zones exhibited reduced improvement and increased slight degradation, whereas nonconflict areas showed marginal enhancement. Through propensity score matching, the research confirmed the causal relationship between conflict and ecological trends. Pathway analysis revealed that the conflict contributed to 0.016 units increase in ecological quality while reducing the improvement rate by 0.042 units. This study provides empirical support for understanding the correlation between conflicts and specific environmental factors, offering technical references for ecological quality assessments in other conflict areas and future evaluations by the Ukrainian government.

            Remote sensing has been applied to observe large areas of surface water to obtain higher-resolution and long-term continuous observation records of surface water. However, limitations remain in the detection of large-scale and multi-temporal surface water mainly due to the high variability in water surface signatures in space and time. In this study, we developed a surface water remote sensing information extraction model that integrates spectral and temporal characteristics to extract surface water from multi-dimensional data of long-term Landsat scenes to explore the spatiotemporal changes in surface water over decades. The goal is to extract open water in vegetation, clouds, terrain shadows, and other land cover backgrounds from medium-resolution remote sensing images. The average overall accuracy and average kappa coefficient of the classification were verified to be 0.91 and 0.81, respectively. Experiments applied to China’s inland arid area have shown that the method is effective under complex surface environmental conditions.

            Remote sensing image segmentation is a crucial technique in the field of land management. However, existing semantic segmentation networks require a large number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) and have long run times. In this paper, we propose a dual-path feature aggregation network (DPFANet) specifically designed for the low-latency operations required in land management applications. Firstly, we use four sets of spatially separable convolutions with varying dilation rates to extract spatial features. Additionally, we use an improved version of MobileNetV2 to extract semantic features. Furthermore, we use an asymmetric multi-scale fusion module and dual-path feature aggregation module to enhance feature extraction and fusion. Finally, a decoder is constructed to enable progressive up-sampling. Experimental results on the Potsdam data set and the Gaofen image data set (GID) demonstrate that DPFANet achieves overall accuracy of 92.2% and 89.3%, respectively. The FLOPs are 6.72 giga and the number of parameters is 2.067 million.

            The key data for accurate prediction is of great significance to accurately carry out the next step of sustainable land use development plan according to the demand of China. Consequently, the main purposes of our study are: (1) to delineate the characteristics of land use transitions within the Yangtze River Economic Belt; (2) to use the Markov model and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model for comparative analysis and prediction of land use distribution. This study analyzes land use/cover change (LUCC) data from 2010 and 2020 using the land use transition matrix, dynamic degree, and comprehensive index model and predicts 2025 land use by the Markov model. The study identifies a reduction in land usage over 11 years, particularly in grassland. The Markov and ARIMA models' significance is 0.002 (P < 0.01), showing arable land and woodland dominance, with varying changes in other land types.

            The power grid plays a vital role in the construction of livelihood projects by transmitting electrical energy. In the event of insulator explosions on power grid towers, these insulators may detach, presenting potential safety risks to transmission lines. The identification of such failures relies on the examination of images captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, accurately detecting insulator defects remains challenging, particularly when dealing with variations in size. Existing methods exhibit limited accuracy in detecting small objects. In this paper, we propose a novel detection method that incorporates the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) as an attention mechanism into the backbone of the "you only look once" version 5 (YOLOv5) model. Additionally, we integrate a residual structure into the model to learn additional information and features related to insulators, thereby enhancing detection efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieved F1 scores of 0.87 for insulator detection and 0.89 for insulator defect detection. The improved YOLOv5 network shows promise in detecting insulators and their defects in UAV images.

            Image segmentation is essential for object-oriented analysis, and classification is a critical parameter influencing analysis accuracy. However, image classification and segmentation based on spectral features are easily perturbed by the high-frequency information of a high spatial resolution remotely sensed (HSRRS) image, degrading its classification and segmentation quality. This article first presents a pixel texture index (PTI) by describing the texture and edge in a local area surrounding a pixel. Indeed.. The experimental results highlight that the HSRRS image classification and segmentation quality can be effectively improved by combining it with the PTI image. Indeed, the overall accuracy improved from 7% to 14%, and the kappa can be increased from 11% to 24%, respectively.

            Accurately obtaining crop cultivation extent and estimating the cultivated area are significant for adjusting regional planting structure. This article proposes a parcel-level crop classification method using time-series, medium-resolution, remote sensing images and single-phase, high-spatial-resolution, remote sensing images. The deep learning semantic segmentation network feature pyramid network with squeeze-and-excitation network (FPN-SENet) and multi-scale segmentation were used to extract cultivated land parcels from Gaofen-2 imagery, while the pixel-level crop types were classified by using support vector machine algorithms from time-series Sentinel-2 images. Then, the parcel-level crop classification was obtained from the pixel-level crop types and land parcels.

            Drought is a devastating natural hazard and exerts profound effects on both the environment and society. Predicting drought occurrences is significant in aiding decision-making and implementing effective mitigation strategies. In regions characterized by limited data availability, such as Southern Africa, the use of satellite remote sensing data promises an excellent opportunity for achieving this predictive goal. In this article, we assess the effectiveness of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) soil moisture data in predicting drought conditions using multiple linear regression-predicted data and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) soil moisture data.

            Debris flow susceptibility evaluation plays a crucial role in the prevention and control of debris flow disasters. Therefore, this article proposes a convolutional neural network model named multi-level feature extraction network (MFENet). First, a dual-channel CNN architecture incorporating the Embedding Channel Attention mechanism is used to extract shallow features from both digital elevation model images and multispectral images. Subsequently, channel shuffle and feature concatenation are applied to the features from the two channels to obtain fused feature sets. Following this, a deep feature extraction is performed on the fused feature sets using a residual module improved by maximum pooling. Finally, the susceptibility index of gullies to debris flows is calculated based on the similarity scores.

            This paper proposes a framework that combines the improved "You Only Look Once" version 5 (YOLOv5) and SegFormer to extract tailings ponds from multi-source data. Points of interest (POIs) are crawled to capture potential tailings pond regions. Jeffries–Matusita distance is used to evaluate the optimal band combination. The improved YOLOv5 replaces the backbone with the PoolFormer to form a PoolFormer backbone. The neck introduces the CARAFE operator to form a CARAFE feature pyramid network neck (CRF-FPN). The head is substituted with an efficiency decoupled head. POIs and classification data optimize improved YOLOv5 results. After that, the SegFormer is used to delineate the boundaries of tailings ponds. Experimental results demonstrate that the mean average precision of the improved YOLOv5s has increased by 2.78% compared to the YOLOv5s, achieving 91.18%. The SegFormer achieves an intersection over union of 88.76% and an accuracy of 94.28%.

            This article introduces a comprehensive methodology for mapping and assessing the urban built-up areas and establishing a spatial gross domestic product (GDP) model for Zhengzhou using night-time light (NTL) data, alongside socioeconomic statistical data from 2012 to 2017. Two supervised sorting algorithms, namely the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm and the deep learning (DL) algorithm, which includes the U-Net and fully convolutional neural (FCN) network models, are proposed for urban built-up area identification and image classification. Comparisons with Municipal Bureau of Statistics data highlight the U-Net neural network model exhibits superior accuracy, especially in areas with diverse characteristics. For each year from 2012 to 2017, a spatial GDP model was developed based on Zhengzhou's urban GDP and U-Net sorted images. This research provides valuable insights into urban development and economic assessment for the city.

            A devastating landslide incident occurred on 24 June 2017, causing huge losses for Xinmo Village in western Sichuan. In this paper, we used two interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) methods, permanent scatterer (PS)-InSAR and small baseline subset (SBAS)- InSAR, to analyze deformation signals in the area in the 2 years leading up to the landslide event using Sentinel-1A ascending data. Our experimental findings from PS-InSAR and SBAS-InSAR revealed that the deformation rates in the study region ranged between –50 to 20 mm/year and –30 to 10 mm/year, respectively. Furthermore, the deformation rates of the same points, as determined by these methods, exhibited a significant increase prior to the event. We also investigated the causal relationship between rainfall and landslide events, demonstrating that deformation rates correlate with changes in rainfall, albeit with a time lag. Therefore, using time-series InSAR for landslide monitoring in Xinmo Village is a viable approach.

            The density and uniformity of lidar data play crucial roles in the cor-responding data processing steps. One factor influencing point density and spacing in lidar data is the presence of empty pulses, where no return is detected. Missing returns can occur due to atmospheric absorption, specular and diffusive reflection, etc. To address this issue and enhance point density, this paper introduces a novel method for approximating missing returns in airborne lidar data collected over urban areas. This technique focuses on approximating returns for empty pulses that hit spots near abrupt slope changes on building and ground surfaces. The proposed methodology is validated through experiments using a lidar data set from downtown Dublin, Ireland. The collected data contained numerous gaps associated with wet surfaces, as well as missing returns on vertical and oblique surfaces.

            In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the extraction of high-quality frames to enhance the fidelity of videogrammetry by combining fuzzy frames removal and baseline constraints. We first implement a gradient-based mutual information method to filter out low-quality frames while preserving the integrity of the videos. After frame pose estimation, the geometric properties of the baseline are constrained by three aspects to extract the keyframes: quality of relative orientation, baseline direction, and base to distance ratio. The three-dimensional model is then reconstructed based on these extracted keyframes. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach maintains a strong robustness throughout the aerial triangulation, leading to high levels of reconstruction precision across diverse video scenarios. Compared to other methods, this paper improves the reconstruction accuracy by more than 0.2 mm while simultaneously maintaining the completeness.

            To extract terraced fields in hilly areas on a large scale in an automated and high-precision manner, this paper proposes a terrace extraction method that combines the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Sentinel-2 imagery, and the improved U-Net semantic segmentation model. The U-Net model is modified by introducing Attention Gate modules into its decoding modules to suppress the interference of redundant features and adding Dropout and Batch Normalization layers to improve training speed, robustness, and fitting ability. In addition, the DEM band is combined with the red, green, and blue bands of the remote sensing images to make full use of terrain information. The experimental results show that the Precision, Recall, F1 score, and Mean Intersection over Union of the proposed method for terrace extraction are improved to other mainstream advanced methods, and the internal information of the terraces extracted is more complete, with fewer false positive and false negative results.

            The advancements in space technology have facilitated water quality (WQ) monitoring of lake conditions at a spatial resolution of 10 m by freely accessible Sentinel-2 images. The main aim of this article was to elucidate the necessity of spatiotemporal WQ monitoring of the shrinking Lake Burdur in Türkiye by examining the relation between field and satellite data with a state-of-the-art machine learning- based regression algorithm. This study focuses on detection of algal blooms and WQ parameters, which are chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and suspended solids (SS). Furthermore, this study leverages the advantage of geographic position of Lake Burdur, located at the overlap of two Sentinel-2 frames, which enables the acquisition of satellite images at a temporal resolution of 2–3 days. The findings enrich the understanding of the lake's dynamic structure by rapidly monitoring the occurrence of algal blooms. High accuracies were achieved for Chl-a (R-squared: 0.93) and SS (R-squared: 0.94) detection.

            Few-shot scene classification methods aim to obtain classification discriminative ability from few labeled samples and has recently seen substantial advancements. However, the current few-shot learning approaches still suffer from overfitting due to the scarcity of labeled samples. To this end, a few-shot semi-supervised method is proposed to address this issue. Specifically, semi-supervised learning method is used to increase target domain samples; then we train multiple classification models using the augmented samples. Finally, we perform decision fusion of the results obtained from the multiple models to accomplish the image classification task. According to the experiments conducted on two real few-shot remote sensing scene datasets, our proposed method achieves significantly higher accuracy (approximately 1.70% to 4.33%) compared to existing counterparts.
