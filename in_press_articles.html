            Due to the ecological pressures of global warming and human activities in coastal regions, coral reef ecosystems, predominantly located in shallow marine areas, are facing severe threats to their survival. Scientists and governmental managers are eager to leverage novel aerial remote sensing technologies to address the challenges of acquiring accurate, comprehensive, and timely data on coral reef health, structural complexity, and spatial distribution. This study aims to tackle these challenges by using precise and accurate aerial remote sensing data to support the restoration and sustainable prosperity of coral reef systems. Specifically, this study develops and applies an efficient coral survey method based on aerial remote sensing. The method integrates aerial imagery and bathymetric lidar (light detection and ranging) point cloud data and uses advanced photogrammetric computer vision and deep learning algorithms. Using a state-of-the-art multi-modal neural network segmentation technique, the proposed method enables high-precision and intelligent identification of coral reefs, facilitating detailed habitat mapping. Furthermore, by accurately delineating the habitat range and geometric structures of reefs, this approach allows for precise measurements of coral biomass production and skeletal calcification. These metrics help assess coral reef structural complexity and their adaptability to environmental stressors, providing robust scientific data for conservation strategies and policy making. The use of advanced multi-modal aerial remote sensing data not only enhances monitoring reliability and accuracy but also offers a cost-effective and flexible tool for coral reef ecological mapping. This approach effectively addresses challenges encountered in coastal ecological surveys, particularly in areas where direct human access or boat entry is difficult.

            India yearly experiences natural disasters such as floods, droughts, cyclones, and landslides, which not only disrupt but also significantly affect the socioeconomic activities of its people. Darjeeling, one of the most valuable districts of West Bengal, India, is located in the foothills of the mighty Himalayas. Landslides in Darjeeling, particularly during the monsoon season, severely affect the socioeconomic conditions of the local population. This research creates a landslide susceptibility map of Darjeeling using the frequency ratio model (FRM) and geographical weighted regression (GWR). The study considers 16 landslide-conditioning factors and 743 past landslide events, of which 70% are used for modeling and the remaining 30% are used for validation. The generated landslide susceptibility map categorizes the area into very low, low, moderate, high, and very high susceptibility zones. Results show that most of the study area falls within the high susceptibility zone, covering approximately 28.45% of the region. The study also reveals that the northern hilly regions of the district are more prone to landslides compared with the southern part, based on FRM and GWR. The area under curve indicates that the model achieved a 74.7% success rate. The highest value of the landslide density index was found in areas classified as having very high landslide susceptibility. Therefore, considering the landslide susceptibility, implementation of effective management strategies is essential for ensuring the future development of the district.

            The geometric calibration accuracy of the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) system is affected by the extraction accuracy of Corner Reflector (CR) points in a Single-Look Complex (SLC) image. There are some problems in traditional artificial extraction methods for CR points, such as the difficulty of identifying CR points without prior knowledge, low efficiency, and limited extraction accuracy. An extraction method of the phase center for CR points without prior knowledge was proposed in this paper through the construction of a geometric error compensation model for SAR images and the study of high precision fitting methods of the phase center for CR points. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by the Gaofen-3 (GF-3) satellite image data. Experimental results demonstrated that the extraction accuracy of CR points could be better than 0.2 pixel for GF-3 images.

            A High-Quality Underwater 3D Reconstruction Solution for Coral Reef Environments Leveraging Advanced Photogrammetric Computer Vision Techniques

            Coral reefs, with their intricate 3D structures, are vital marine ecosystems increasingly threatened by environmental stressors. Accurate 3D reconstruction of these underwater structures is essential for scientific research and conservation management. While underwater photogrammetry has emerged as a promising tool for this purpose, technical challenges persist in capturing fine-scale features under underwater conditions, particularly the intricate morphology of coral reefs and the highly complex textures that hinder high-fidelity reconstruction. Recent breakthroughs in computer vision and deep learning have introduced new opportunities for underwater photogrammetry. This study begins by outlining a photogrammetric workflow that can integrate current advanced technologies, followed by summarizing cutting-edge methods used in the key stages, i.e., sparse and dense reconstruction. Building on previous research, we propose a hierarchical reconstruction strategy for accurate and efficient dense modeling. Our approach first performs an efficient global coarse-grained reconstruction to capture the overall scene structure, followed by fine-scale modeling in key regions of interest. Using image data collected from a coral reef site at Moorea Island, we compare and evaluate various techniques, analyzing their respective strengths and limitations. In sparse reconstruction, the classical feature method scale-invariant feature transform demonstrates competitive performance. Deep learning–based methods, such as ALIKED feature and the SuperGlue matching network, achieve superior results on certain metrics. For dense reconstruction, Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting–based methods yield high-quality reconstructions but are computationally intensive. In contrast, the deep learning–based multi-view stereo approach achieves comparable reconstruction quality with greater efficiency. Experimental results on reconstruction result fusion further validate that our approach offers a scalable and practical solution for coral reef monitoring, advancing conservation science and ecosystem management practices.

            Texture-Semantic Point: Registration for Point Clouds of Porcelain Relics

            Point cloud models of porcelain are captured through the multi-registration of point clouds, which presents a challenging task. On the one hand, the smooth surface of porcelain lacks geometric feature variation, making it difficult to establish corresponding points. On the other hand, the overall geometric symmetry of most porcelain relics can easily lead to iterative calculations falling into the local minimum convergence trap. To address the difficulties in feature point selection, we propose a novel approach using texture-semantic points as features for coarse registration. We first select rich texture points as 2D candidates and establish a 2D-3D matching relationship, giving each candidate its 3D spatial location and associated texture information. Using these correspondences, we perform coarse alignment of the point clouds. However, in reality, the point clouds are not aligned, and the registration calculation fails because of geometric symmetry issues. To address this, we integrate a control net into the iterative closest point (ICP) calculation to guide iterations towards the correct Special Euclidean group in 3 dimensions (SE(3)) transformation, achieving refined alignment. Finally, considering porcelain’s symmetrical geometry, we introduce a pose optimization constraint using the symmetry axis as a weighted parameter to limit degrees of freedom and enhance registration accuracy. Experiments were conducted on seven porcelain datasets to evaluate the proposed approach. A qualitative analysis demonstrated successful refined alignment using the proposed approach. In addition, we performed a quantitative comparison with state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results showed that our approach outperformed others across all models when applied to the registration of geometrically symmetric porcelain; Specifically, the proposed method achieved a 50% enhancement in accuracy compared with others, measured by the distance between the labeled corresponding points.

            In this study, we explore using satellite observations to assess community recovery from natural disasters such as fires and hurricanes, supplementing the Resilience Inference Model (RIM). The RIM model has been successfully used to quantify recoveries from hurricanes along the Gulf Coast, but it relies on long-term population changes over years or decades. Our approach integrates satellite observations to enhance recovery assessment with a shorter latency of weeks or months. Using fire, vegetation, and night light data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) with daily global observations, Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite/Advanced Baseline Imager, we quantitatively evaluate fire intensity, light outage, and urban greenness changes, along with subsequent recovery, focusing on the 2023 Maui fire and selected hurricane cases along the Gulf Coast. This approach complements the RIM model by introducing quantifiable physical parameters with shorter latency, particularly beneficial in areas where census data are either unavailable or unreliable.
