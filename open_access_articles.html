            Land use and land cover studies are fundamental to achieving sustainable development goals by providing the information necessary for informed decision-making in social and economic development and natural resource management. This study relied on remote sensing data to analyze and assess land use and land cover changes in Babil Province, Iraq, over the past two decades. The study focused on identifying the patterns and factors influencing these changes, using Landsat satellite imagery to create digital maps classifying land into four main categories: urban lands, bare soil lands, water bodies, and vegetation lands. The results showed a noticeable expansion of urban lands at the expense of bare soil lands, primarily attributed to population growth, economic development, and improved security conditions. This study underscores the importance of sustainable land management and urban planning in Babil Province. These results highlight the importance of sustainable land management in Babil Province, including sound urban planning considering urban expansion's environmental, social, and economic effects. The classification was implemented using a maximum likelihood classifier, and the accuracy assessment yielded satisfactory results with an overall accuracy of 93.5517%. This study encourages using artificial intelligence to track and analyze land use changes in Babil.

            Remote sensing image fusion is consistently used to turn raw images of different resolutions, sources, and modalities into accurate, complete, and spatiotemporally coherent images. It facilitates downstream applications such as pan sharpening, change detection, and classification. However, image fusion solutions are highly disparate to various remote sensing problems and are often narrowly defined in existing reviews as topical applications (e. g., pan sharpening). Theoretically, image fusion can be applied to any gridded data through pixel-level operations; thus, we expand its scope by comprehensively surveying relevant works. We develop a simple taxonomy for many-to-one and many-to-many image fusion, defining it as a mapping problem turning one or multiple images into another set based on desired coherence. Furthermore, we provide a meta-analysis to cover 10,420 peer-reviewed papers from the 1980s to 2023 studying various types of image fusion and their applications. Finally, we discuss image fusion's benefits and emerging challenges to provide open research directions.

            Hyperspectral sensors provide near-continuous spectral data that can facilitate advancements in agricultural crop classification and characterization, which are important for addressing global food and water security issues. We investigated two new-generation hyperspectral sensors, Germany’s Deutsches Zentrum für Luft‐ und Raumfahrt Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer (DESIS) and Italy’s PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA), within California???s Central Valley in August 2021 focusing on five irrigated agricultural crops (alfalfa, almonds, corn, grapes, and pistachios). With reference data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Cropland Data Layer, we developed a spectral library of the crops and classified them using three machine learning algorithms (support vector machines [SVM], random forest [RF], and spectral angle mapper [SAM]) and two philosophies: 1. Full spectral analysis (FSA) and 2. Optimal hyperspectral narrowband (OHNB) analysis. For FSA, we used 59 DESIS four-bin product bands and 207 of 238 PRISMA bands. For OHNB analysis, 9 DESIS and 16 PRISMA nonredundant OHNBs for studying crops were selected. FSA achieved only 1% to 3% higher accuracies relative to OHNB analysis in most cases. SVM provided the best results, closely followed by RF. Using both DESIS and PRISMA image OHNBs in SVM for classification led to higher accuracy than using either image alone, with an overall accuracy of 99%, producer’s accuracies of 94% to 100%, and user???s accuracies of 95% to 100%.

            Riverbank lines change over time, causing loss of land and property. Accurate mapping of riverbank lines is essential for restoration and preservation. This paper presents a method to map riverbank lines by combining georeferenced orthoimages and lidar digital elevation model (DEM). This method uses the properties that lidar can provide elevations under trees and open water edges are visible in orthoimages to extract the planimetric locations of bank lines. The orthoimage pixels with less than 0.15% slope on the DEM were replaced by water pixels. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted using DEM, slope, and orthoimage bands. Training data of river body and the background were identified manually on the first three component images. An alpha matting–based method was implemented using the training data to extract the bank lines. Bankline using α value of 50% probability were statistically and visually better when compared to the manual bank lines.

            Mapping distribution of alterations around porphyry copper deposits (PCDs) greatly affects mineral exploration. Diverse geological processes generate irregular alteration patterns with diverse spectral characteristics in mineral deposits. Applying remotely sensed hyperspectral images (HSIs) is an appealing technology for geologic surveyors to generate alteration maps. Conventional methods mainly use shallow spectral absorption features to discriminate minerals and cannot extract their important spectral information. Deep neural networks with nonlinear layers can evoke the deep spectral and spatial information of HSIs. Deep learning???based methods include fully connected neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and hybrid convolutional networks like mixed convolution neural network and covariance pooling (MCNN‐CP) algorithms. However, each has its advantages and limitations. To significantly avoid losing important spectral features, we proposed a new method by fusing a one‐dimensional convolutional neural network (1D‐CNN) with MCNN‐CP (1D‐MCNN‐CP), achieving an overall accuracy (97.44%) of mineral mapping from PRISMA HSIs. This research deduced that 1D‐MCNN‐CP improved performance and reduced misclassification errors among minerals sharing similar spectral features.

            Uncrewed aerial systems (UASs) have been used to collect “pseudo field plot” data in the form of large-scale stereo imagery to supplement and bolster direct field observations to monitor areas in Alaska. These data supplement field data that is difficult to collect in such a vast landscape with a relatively short field season. Dense photogrammetrically derived point clouds are created and are facilitated to extract land cover data using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier in this study. We test our approach using point clouds derived from 1-cm stereo imagery of plots in the Alaska North Slope region and compare the results to field observations. The results show that the overall accuracy of six land cover classes (bare soil, shrub, grass, forb/herb, rock, and litter) is 96.8% from classified patches. Shrub had the highest accuracy (>99%) and forb/herb achieved the lowest (<48%). This study reveals that the approach could be used as reference data to check field observations in remote areas.

            In ecologically vulnerable regions with intricate land use dynamics, such as ecotones, frequent and intense land use transitions unfold. Therefore, the precise and timely mapping of land use becomes imperative. With that goal, by using principal component analysis, we integrated Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, using an object-oriented methodology to craft a 10-meter-resolution land use map for the forest‐grassland ecological zone of the Greater Khingan Mountains spanning the years 2019 to 2021. Our research reveals a substantial enhancement in classification accuracy achieved through the integration of synthetic aperture radar‐optical remote sensing data. Notably, our products outperformed other land use/land cover data sets, excelling particularly in delineating intricate riverine wetlands. The 10-meter land use product stands as a pivotal guide, offering indispensable support for sustainable development, ecological assessment, and conservation endeavors in the Greater Khingan Mountains region.

            The ecosystem of Mosquito Lagoon, Florida, has been rapidly deteriorating since the 2010s, with a notable decline in keystone seagrass species. Seagrass is vital for many species in the lagoon, but nutrient overloading, algal blooms, boating, manatee grazing, and other factors have led to its loss. To understand this decline, a deep neural network analyzed Landsat imagery from 2000 to 2020. Results showed significant seagrass loss post-2013, coinciding with the 2011–2013 super algal bloom. Seagrass abundance varied annually, with the model performing best in years with higher seagrass coverage. While the deep learning method successfully identified seagrass, it also revealed that recent seagrass coverage is almost non-existent. This monitoring approach could aid in ecosystem recovery if coupled with appropriate policies for Mosquito Lagoon's restoration.

            In global navigation satellite systems (GNSS)-denied environments, vision-based methods are commonly used for the positioning and navigation of aerial robots. However, traditional methods often suffer from accumulative estimation errors over time, leading to trajectory drift and lack real-time performance, particularly in large-scale scenarios. This article presents novel approaches, including feature-based cross-view image matching and the integration of visual odometry and photogrammetric space resection for camera pose determination in real-time. Experimental evaluation with real UAV datasets demonstrated that the proposed method reliably matches features in cross-view images with large differences in spatial resolution, coverage, and perspective views, achieving a root-mean-square error of 4.7 m for absolute position error and 0.33° for rotation error, and delivering real-time performance of 12 frames per second (FPS) when implemented in a lightweight edge device onboard UAV. This approach offters potential for diverse intelligent UAV applications in GNSS-denied environments based on real-time feedback control.

            Currently, digital cameras and equipment used underwater are often inaccessible to the general public due to their professional-grade quality and high cost. Therefore alternative solutions have been sought that are both cost-effective and suitable for nonprofessional use. A review of the literature shows that researchers primarily use GoPro action cameras, while other action cameras with similar capabilities are rarely used. This study thus examines underwater photogrammetry methods using a widely recognized action camera as a reference and compares it with another camera of similar characteristics as a potential alternative. For a comprehensive temporal analysis in underwater studies, both cameras were used to capture photographic and video imagery, and the resulting 3D point clouds were compared. Comparison criteria included data collection and processing times, point cloud densities, cloud-to-cloud analysis, and assessments of surface density and roughness. Having analysed, the study concluded that the proposed alternative action camera can feasibly be used in underwater photogrammetry.

            This article presents recommendations and corresponding detailed procedures for the assessment of a geolocation system's accuracy, as well as the specification of accuracy requirements and their subsequent validation when they are available. Applicable metrics and related processing are based on samples of corresponding geolocation errors. This article also presents similar recommendations for the predicted accuracy of a geolocation system, based on samples of geolocation error, as well as corresponding predicted error covariance matrices associated with the geolocations. Reliable error covariance matrices enable optimal use of a geolocation system's products, such as the optimal fusion of multiple geolocations or multiple products for higher confidence and increased accuracy. The recommendations presented in this article enable reliable estimates of accuracy and reliable predicted accuracies, both of which are critical to many geolocation-based applications. The recommendations associated with predicted accuracy are also relatively new and innovative.

            The aim of the study is to identify factors affecting the sight-aesthetic value of the underwater landscapes of lakes for the purposes of exploration tourism. The reason for undertaking this topic is the lack of such studies for inland water bodies. The results will contribute to expanding and supplementing the knowledge on the assessment of the sight-aesthetic attractiveness of landscapes and fill gaps in knowledge about the underwater landscapes of lakes. The questionnaire survey implemented the direct comparison method described by Kendall (Kendall, M. G. 1970.Rank Correlation Methods. Charles Griffin and Co: Glasgow, Scotland). According to respondents, animals and submerged anthropogenic elements are the most visually attractive in an aquatic environment The results obtained are the reason for conducting further research and developing the methodology for the assessment of the sight-aesthetic value of inland bodies of water based on the experience of terrestrial landscape researchers.

            In terms of contribution to global food security, this study aimed to build a crop monitoring system for within-season yield prediction of US corn and soybeans by using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (time-series data, which consists of three essential core algorithms (crop phenology detection, early crop classification, and crop yield prediction methods)). Within-season predictions for 2018–2022 were then made to evaluate the perfor- mance of the proposed system by comparing it with the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) monthly forecasts and the fixed statistical data. The absolute percentage errors of the proposed system for predicting national-level yield and production were less than 5% for all simulation years as of day of year (DOY) 279. The prediction accuracy as of DOY 247 and DOY 279 were comparable to the USDA's forecasts. The proposed system would enable us to make a comprehensive understanding about overview of US corn and soybean crop condition by visualizing detail spatial pattern of good- or poor harvest regions on a within-season basis.

            Cultural heritage building information modeling (HBIM) is an emerging process allowing us to reconstruct built heritage virtually. The data of a digitally documented cultural heritage building offers significant advantages as it is accessible and modifiable by all professionals involved in the same or different projects. The most important factor affecting the accuracy and precision of the HBIM model is the ability to collect complete and accurate information about the physical structure. Combining terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry point clouds is one of the most efficient ways to capture accurate digital data on the building. This study provides the foundation for creating an HBIM model for cultural heritage the coupling of spatial data with TLS and UAV. This paper aims to generate synergy between TLS and UAV point cloud data and ensure that the spatial database contains sufficient data to model historical objects with HBIM tendencies.

            Lotus wetland is a type of wetland that can efficiently purify water. Therefore, rapid and accurate remote sensing monitoring of the distribution of lotus wetland has great significance to their conservation and the promotion of a sustainable and healthy development of ecosystems. The phenology-based method has proven effective in mapping some different types of wetlands. However, because of the serious absence of remote sensing data caused by cloud coverage and the differences in the phenological rhythms of lotus wetlands in different areas, achieving high-precision mapping of different regions using a unified approach is a challenge. To address the issue, this article proposes a Phenology Normalized Lotus Index (PNLI) model that combines SAR time-series imagery and the phenology-based method. The results of this study demonstrate that the PNLI model shows good applicability in different areas and has high mapping accuracy. The model can map the lotus wetland distribu tion in large areas quickly and simultaneously with high precision.

            Many remote sensing and geoscience applications require a high-precision terrain model. In 2022, the Forest And Buildings removed Copernicus digital elevation model (FABDEM) was released, in which trees and buildings were removed at a 30 m resolution. Therefore, it was necessary to make a comprehensive evaluation of this model. This research aims to perform a qualitative and quantitative analysis of fabdem in comparison with the commonly used global dems. We investigated the effect of the terrain slope, aspect, roughness, and land cover types in causing errors in the topographic representation of all dems. The fabdem had the highest overall vertical accuracy of 5.56 m. It was the best dem in representing the terrain roughness. The fabdem and Copernicus dem were equally influenced by the slopes more than the other models and had the worst accuracy of slope representation. In the tree, built, and flooded vegetation areas of the fabdem, the mean errors in elevation have been reduced by approximately 3.34 m, 1.26 m and 1.55 m, respectively. Based on Welch's t-test, there was no significant difference between fabdem and Copernicus dem elevations. However, the slight improvements in the fabdem make it the best filtered dem to represent the terrain heights over different land cover types.

            Surface reconstruction has been studied thoroughly, but very little work has been done to address its evaluation. In this article, we propose new visibility-based metrics to assess the completeness and accuracy of three-dimensional meshes based on a point cloud of higher accuracy than the one from which the reconstruction has been computed. We use the position from which each high-quality point has been acquired to compute the corresponding ray of free space. Based on the intersections between each ray and the reconstructed surface, our metrics allow evaluating both the global coherency of the reconstruction and the accuracy at close range. We validate this evaluation protocol by surveying several open-source algorithms as well as a piece of licensed software on three data sets. The results confirm the relevance of assessi ng local and global accuracy separately since algorithms sometimes fail at guaranteeing both simultaneously. In addition, algorithms making use of sensor positions perform better than the ones relying only on points and normals, indicating a potentially significant added value of this piece of information. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/umrlastig/SurfaceReconEval.

            Urban vegetation phenology is important for understanding the relationship between human activities on urban ecosystems and carbon cycle. The relationship between urban and rural vegetation phenology and environmental and meteorological factors were studied across urban-rural gradients. However, the relationship of intra-urban urbanization intensity (UI) gradients on vegetation at the start of season (SOS) is unclear. Here, we used remote sensing data to quantitatively assess the relationship of vegetation SOS to UI gradients at mid-high latitudes in the northern hemisphere. The results showed that urban area vegetation SOS widely presented earlier than for rural area vegetation. Across the cities we investigated the extent UI gradient was prevalent as a threshold (33.2% ± 2.3%) of surface temperature to SOS advance enhancement and offset. At low urbanization enhanced surface temperature on sos advances, while at high urbanization offset surface temperature on SOS advances. Overall, UI demonstrated a nonlinear relationship with sos. The results of this study suggest that there may be thresholds of impact on vegetation SOS in future global climate and environment change processes, where opposite effects can occur below and above thresholds.

            The transformation of global navigation satellite systems coordi- nates between any two datums represents a vital procedure. Although the geocentric coordinates (X, Y, Z) of two datums can be trans- formed using the 7-parameters method, the conversion of Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projected coordinates (E, N) between two systems cannot be applied with the same procedure. However, see Jassim (2022), which discusses a method that allows the transformation between any two datums using the utm projected coordinates directly regarding the variation of the datum's semi-major axis and the eccentricity. The results of the evaluation of this method show that there is a significant shift in the transformed coordinates due to the imperfection of the used algorithm. While this research suggests a modification in the previous algorithm by adding the latitude's variation as a third significant factor besides the other two variations (∂a, ∂e2, and Δ), the suggested modification gives a high decline in the uncertainty of the position values. Furthermore, it takes a homogenous fixed limit for different places over Iraqi territory.

            Edge detection is highly susceptible to streaking caused by speckles in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) imagery. In this article, we address hysteresis thresholding for suppress streaking in PolSAR's edge detection. As an example, an approach is suggested by combining the constant false alarm ratio (CFAR) detector and the hysteresis thresholding. After thinning edges obtained by the CFAR detector, the hysteresis thresholding is employed to reduce edge streaking, which is caused by abundant speckles. A ratio of the high to the low threshold Pfain the hysteresis thresholding is pointed out for linking edges. Experiments are carried out on both simulated and real PolSAR data sets, and the results reveal that hysteresis thresh- olding obviously promotes the performance of the CFAR detector.

            Large-area land use land cover (LULC) mapping using high-resolution imagery remains challenging due to radiometric differences between scenes, the low spectral depth of the imagery, landscape heterogeneity, and computational limitations. Using a random forest (RF)- supervised machine-learning algorithm, we present a geographic object-based image analysis approach to classifying a large mosaic of 220 National Agriculture Imagery Program orthoimagery into lulc categories. The approach was applied in central Texas, USA, covering over 6000 km2. We generated 36 variables for each object and accounted for spatial structures of sample data to determine the distance at which samples were spatially independent. The final rf model produced 94.8% accuracy on independent stratified random samples. In addition, vegetation and water indices, the mean and standard deviation of principal components, and texture features improved classification accuracy. This study demonstrates a cost-effective way of producing an accurate multi-class land use/land cover map using high-spatial/low-spectral resolution orthoimagery.

            Bathymetric data, comprising elevations of submerged surfaces (e. g., seafloor or lake bed), constitute a critical need for a wide range of science and application focus areas, such as safety of marine navi- gation, benthic habitat mapping, flood inundation modeling, and coastal engineering. Over the past decade, the availability of near- shore bathymetric data has increased dramatically due to advances in satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB). One notable advance occurred with the 2018 launch of NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2), carrying the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS). However, much like other Earth observing satellites, ATLAS is often hampered by obstructions, such as clouds, which block the sensor's view of the Earth's surface. In this study, we introduce the Deep Occlusion Recovery of Satellite Lidar From ICESat-2 Network (DORSL-FIN) to recover partially occluded bathymetric profiles. We show that DORSL-FIN is able to accurately recover occluded bathymetry and outperforms other methods of interpolation.

            Deep learning (dl), especially convolutional neural networks (cnns), has been proven to be an excellent feature extractor and widely applied to hyperspectral image (hsi) classification. However, dl is a computationally demanding algorithm with many parameters and a high computational burden, which seriously restricts the deployment ofdl-basedhsiclassification algorithms on mobile and embedded systems. In this paper, we propose an extremely lightweight conditional three-dimensional (3D) hsi with a double-branch structure to solve these problems. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight conditional 3D convolution to replace the conventional 3D convolution to reduce the computational and memory cost of the network and achieve flexiblehsifeature extraction. Then, based on lightweight conditional 3D convolution, we build two parallel paths to independently exploit and optimize the diverse spatial and spectral features. Furthermore, to precisely locate the key information, which is conducive to classification, a lightweight attention mechanism is carefully designed to refine extracted spatial and spectral features, and improve the classification accuracy with less computation and memory costs. Experiments on three publichsidata sets show that the proposed model can effectively reduce the cost of computation and memory, achieve high execution speed, and better classification performance compared with several recent dl-based models.

            Building extraction from high-resolution remote sensing images benefits various practical applications. However, automation of this process is challenging due to the variety of building surface coverings, complex spatial layouts, different types of structures, and tree occlusion. In this study, we propose a multilayer perception network for building extraction from high-resolution remote sensing images. By constructing parallel networks at different levels, the proposed network retains spatial information of varying feature resolutions and uses the parsing module to perceive the prominent features of buildings, thus enhancing the model's parsing ability to target scale changes and complex urban scenes. Further, a structure-guided loss function is constructed to optimize building extraction edges. Experiments on multi-source remote sensing data sets show that our proposed multi-level perception network presents a superior performance in building extraction tasks.

            Post-hurricane damage assessments are often costly and time-consuming. Remotely sensed data provides a complementary method of data collection that can be completed comparatively quickly and at relatively low cost. This study focuses on 15 Florida counties impacted by Hurricane Michael (2018), which had category 5 strength winds at landfall. The present study evaluates the ability of aerial imagery collected to cost-effectively measure blue tarps on buildings for disaster impact and recovery. A support vector machine model classified blue tarp, and parcels received a damage indicator based on the model's prediction. The model had an overall accuracy of 85.3% with a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 96.7%. The model results indicated approximately 7% of all parcels (27 926 residential and 4431 commercial parcels) in the study area as having blue tarp present. The study results may benefit jurisdictions that lacked financial resources to conduct on-the-ground damage assessments.

            At the research points, the relationship between the Normalized Difference Vegetation and Normalized Green Red Difference indices is characterized by a determination coefficient equal to 0.52. The estimation of the emission of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide in the forest air at an altitude of 40 m above the level of the soil cover during the growing season showed differences in their values during the daytime and at night. The results helped determine promising methods of inventory of the carbon landfill forest area for aboveground woody biomass assessment based on data obtained from several sources and land forest estimation research. The research involved: 1) integration of an unmanned aerial vehicle -based digital camera and lidar sensors in order to optimize the efficiency and cost of data collection; 2) taking advantage of high-resolution aerial photographs and sparse lidar point clouds using an information fusion approach and the ability to compensate for their shortcomings.

            Aiming at the problem of rapid construction of a river three-dimensional 3D scene, this article integrates remote sensing, 3D modeling, and CityEngine technology to construct a 3D scene model reconstruction method of river water-land integration. The method includes intelligent extraction of underwater topography, refined modeling of hydraulic structures, and construction of a water-land integrated real scene model. Based on this method, the high-fidelity land-underwater seamless digital terrain and the water-land 3D real scene models can be formed. Through experiments, the feasibility and limitations of this method are verified. It can effectively extract the shallow underwater terrain of inland rivers, and the overall accuracy of the study area is less than 2 m. The performance of the seamless fusion 3D terrain is better than the public digital elevation model data set. In the inland basin of Class I to II water quality, it can meet the needs of intelligent perception of a river- and lake-integrated 3D scene model.

            In this paper, an improved aerosol optical depth (AOD ) retrieval algorithm is proposed based on Sentinel-2 and AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET ) data. The surface reflectance for AOD retrieval was estimated from the image that had minimal aerosol contamination in a temporal window determined by AERONET data. Validation of the Sentinel-2 AOD retrievals was conducted against four Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET ) sites located in Beijing. The results show that the Sentinel-2 AOD retrievals are highly consistent with the AERONET AOD measurements (R = 0.942), with 85.56% falling within the expected error. The mean absolute error and the root-mean-square error are 0.0688 and 0.0882, respectively. In addition, the AOD distribution map obtained by this algorithm well reflects the fine-spatial-resolution changes in AOD distribution. These results suggest that the improved high-resolution AOD retrieval algorithm is robust and has the potential advantage of retrieving high-resolution AOD over urban areas.

            The detection of changes in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images based on deep learning has been widely used in landslides detection, flood disaster monitoring, and other fields of change detection due to its high classification accuracy. However, the inherent speckle noise in SAR images restricts the performance of existing SAR image change detection algorithms by clustering analysis. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel method for SAR image change detection based on clustering fusion and deep neural networks. We first used hierarchical fuzzy c-means clustering (HFCM ) to process two different images to obtain HFCM classification results. Then a fusion strategy is designed to obtain the fused image from the two HFCM classified images as the pre-classification result. Furthermore, a lightweight deep neural network com posed of a decomposition convolution module and an auxiliary classification module was proposed; the former module could reduce network parameters by 28%, and the latter could reduce network parameters by 33.3%. To improve the recognition performance of the network, the classification layer was replaced by the regression layer at the outcome of the network. By comparing the experiments of different methods on five data sets, the performance of our proposed method is superior.

            The purpose of this article is to explore forest height estimation strategies using topographic data (DEM) combined with TanDEM-X while comparing the effect of volume scattering complex coherence selection on forest height estimation in the traditional random volume over ground (RVoG) three-stage algorithm. In this study, four experimental strategies were designed for comparison based on TanDEM-X polarized interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PolInSAR) data, TanDEM-DEM, and 42 field-measured data. Our results show that in the RVoG model, (1) a reference ground phase to select the volume scattering complex coherence provides greater accuracy in determining forest height, (2) forest height estimation can be achieved by directly using DEM as ground phase information without relying on model solving and obtaining a more accurate forest height than TanDEM-X alone, and (3) the highest estimation accuracy is obtained by using DEM as coherence information among all schemes. Although the difference in forest height estimation results is not significant in this study, it still proves that the forest height estimation strategy of high-precision DEM combined with short-wavelength PolInSAR can not only improve the forest height estimation accuracy but also simplify the solving process of the RVoG model, which is an important reference for global forest parameter estimation and ecosystem detection based on spaceborne PolInSAR.

            Orthorectification of high-resolution satellite images using a terrain- dependent rational function model (RFM) is a difficult task requiring a well-distributed set of ground control points (GCPs), which is often time-consuming and costly operation. Further, RFM is sensitive to over-parameterization due to its many coefficients, which have no physical meaning. Optimization-based meta-heuristic algorithms ap- pear to be an efficient solution to overcome these limitations. This pa- per presents a complete automated RFM terrain-dependent orthorec- tification for satellite images. The proposed method has two parts; the first part suggests automating the GCP extraction by combing Scale- Invariant Feature Transform and Speeded Up Robust Features algo- rithms; and the second part introduces the cascaded meta-heuristic al- gorithm using genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization. In this stage, a modified K-means clustering selection technique was used to support the proposed algorithm for finding the best combinations of GCPs and RFM coefficients. The obtained results are promising in terms of accuracy and stability compared to other literature methods.

            Analyzing rice growth is essential for examining pests, illnesses, lodging, and yield. To create a Digital Surface Model (DSM ) of three important rice breeding stages, an efficient and fast (compared to manual monitoring) Unoccupied Aerial System was used to collect data. Outliers emerge in DSM as a result of the influence of environ- ment and equipment, and the outliers related to rice not only affect the extraction of rice growth changes but are also more challenging to remove. Therefore, after using ground control points uniform geodetic level for filtering, statistical outlier removal (SOR ) and quadratic surface filtering (QSF ) are used. After that, differential operations are applied to the DSM to create a differential digital surface model that can account for the change in rice plant height. Comparing the prediction accuracy before and after filtering: R2= 0.72, RMSE = 5.13cm, nRMSE = 10.65% for the initial point cloud; after QSF, R2= 0.89, RMSE = 2.51cm, nRMSE = 5.21%; after SOR, R2= 0.92, RMSE = 3.32cm, nRMSE = 6.89%. The findings demonstrate that point cloud filtering, particularly SOR, can increase the accuracy of rice monitoring. The method is effective for monitoring, and after filtering, the accuracy is sufficiently increased to satisfy the needs of growth analysis. This has some potential for application and extension.

            Line features are of great importance for the registration of the Vehicle-Borne Mobile Mapping System that contains both lidar and multiple-lens panoramic cameras. In this work, a spherical straight- line model is proposed to detect the unified line features in the panoramic imaging surface based on the Spherical Hough Transform. The local topological constraints and gradient image voting are also combined to register the line features between panoramic images and lidar point clouds within the Hough parameter space. Experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately extract the long strip targets on the panoramic images and avoid spurious or broken line-segments. Meanwhile, the line matching precision between point clouds and panoramic images are also improved.

            To address the problem of weak robustness against geometric attacks of remote sensing images' digital watermarking, a robust watermark- ing algorithm based on template watermarking is proposed in this paper, which improves the robustness of digital watermarking against geometric attacks by constructing stable geometric attack invari- ant features. In this paper, the Discrete Fourier Transform domain template watermark is used as the invariant feature against geometric attacks, and the embedding of the cyclic watermark is used to improve the watermark robustness for recovering the watermark synchroniza- tion relationship. To achieve blind extraction of the watermark, a parameter extraction method based on noise extraction is designed. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively improve the robustness of digital watermarking of remote sensing images against geometric attacks. Meanwhile, it can also resist common image processing attacks and compound attacks.

            The precise geo-positioning of high-resolution satellite imagery (HRSI) without ground control points (GCPs) is an important and fundamental step in global mapping, three-dimensional modeling, and so on. In this paper, to improve the efficiency of large-scale bundle adjustment (BA), we propose a combined Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) and Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) parallel computing approach for the BA of large-scale HRSI without GCPs. The proposed approach consists of three main components: 1) construction of a BA model without GCPs ; 2) reduction of memory consumption using the Compressed Sparse Row sparse matrix format; and 3) improvement of the computational efficiency by the use of the combined PCG and GPU parallel computing method. The experimental results showed that the proposed method: 1) consumes less memory consumption compared to the conventional full matrix format method; 2) demonstrates higher computational efficiency than the single-core, Ceres-solver and multi-core central processing unit computing methods, with 9.48, 6.82, and 3.05 times faster than the above three methods, respectively; 3) obtains comparable BA accuracy with the above three methods, with image residuals of about 0.9 pixels; and 4) is superior to the parallel bundle adjustment method in the reprojection error.

            Terrestrial water storage (TWS) plays a vital role in climatological and hydrological processes. Most of the developed drought indices from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) over Africa neglected the influencing roles of individual water storage components in calculating the drought index and thus may either underestimate or overestimate drought characteristics. In this paper, we proposed a Weighted Water Storage Deficit Index for drought assessment over the major river basins in Africa (i. e., Nile, Congo, Niger, Zambezi, and Orange) with accounting for the contribution of each TWS component on the drought signal. We coupled the GRACE data and WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model through utilizing the component contribution ratio as the weight. The results showed that water storage components demonstrated distinctly different contributions to TWS variability and thus drought signal response in onset and duration. The most severe droughts over the Nile, Congo, Niger, Zambezi, and Orange occurred in 2006, 2012, 2006, 2006, and 2003, respectively. The most prolonged drought of 84 months was observed over the Niger basin. This study suggests that considering the weight of individual components in the drought index provides more reasonable and realistic drought estimates over large basins in Africa from GRACE.

            Lightweight Parallel Octave Convolutional Neural Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification

            Although most deep learning-based methods have achieved excellent performance for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, they are often limited by complex networks and require massive training samples in practical applications. Therefore, designing an efficient, lightweight model to obtain better classification results under small samples situations remains a challenging task. To alleviate this problem, a novel, lightweight parallel octave convolutional neural network (LPOCNN) for HSI classification is proposed in this paper. First, the HSI data is preprocessed to construct two three-dimensional (3D) patch cubes with different spatial and spectral scales for each central pixel, removing redundancy and focusing on extracting spatial features and spectral features, respectively. Next, two non- deep parallel branches are created for the two inputs, which design octave convolution rather than classical 3D convolution to facilitate light weighting of the model. Then two-dimensional convolutional neural network is used to extract deeper spectral-spatial features when fusing spectral-spatial features from different parallel layers. Moreover, the spectral-spatial attention is designed to promote the classification performance even further by adaptively adjusting the weights of different spectral-spatial features according to their contribution to classification. Experiments show that our suggested LPOCNN acquires a significant advantage on classification performance over other competitive methods under small sample situations.

            Highway markings (HMs) are representative elements of inventory digitalization in highway scenes. The accurate position, semantics, and maintenance information of HMs provide significant support for the intelligent management of highways. This article presents a robust and efficient approach for extracting, reconstructing, and degrading analyzing HMs in complex highway scenes. Compared with existing road marking extraction methods, not only can extract HMs in presence of wear and occlusion from point clouds, but we also perform a degradation analysis for HMs. First, the HMs candidate area is determined accurately by sophisticated image processing. Second, the prior knowledge of marking design rules and edge-based matching model that leverages the standard geometric template and radiometric appearance of HMs is used for accurately extracting and reconstructing solid lines and nonsolid markings of HMs, respectively. Finally, two degradation indicators are constructed to describe the completeness of the marking contour and consistency within the marking. Comprehensive experiments on two existing highways revealed that the proposed methods achieved an overall performance of 95.4% and 95.4% in the recall and 93.8% and 95.5% in the precision for solid line and nonsolid line markings, respectively, even with imperfect data. Meanwhile, a database can be established to facilitate agencies' efficient maintenance.

            Energy infrastructure assessments are needed within 72 hours of natural disasters, and previous data collection methods have proven too slow. We demonstrate a scalable end-to-end solution using a prototype unmanned aerial system that performs on-the-edge detection, classification (i.e., damaged or undamaged), and geo-location of utility poles. The prototype is suitable for disaster response because it requires no local communication infrastructure and is capable of autonomous missions. Collections before, during, and after Hurricane Ida in 2021 were used to test the system. The system delivered an F1 score of 0.65 operating with a 2.7 s/frame processing speed with the YOLOv5 large model and an F1 score of 0.55 with a 0.48 s/frame with the YOLOv5 small model. Geo-location uncertainty in the bottom half of the frame was ∼8 m, mostly driven by error in camera pointing measurement. With additional training data to improve performance and detect additional types of features, a fleet of similar drones could autonomously collect actionable post-disaster data.

            Monitoring trees is necessary to manage and take inventory of forests, monitor plants in urban areas, distribute vegetation, monitor change, and establish sensitive and renewable agricultural systems. This study aims to automatically detect, count, and map apricot trees in an orthophoto, covering an area of approximately 48 ha on the ground surface using two different algorithms based on deep learning. Here, Mask region-based convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) and U-Net models were run together with a dilation operator to detect apricot trees in UAV images, and the performances of the models were compared. Results show that Mask R-CNN operated in this way performs better in tree detection, counting, and mapping tasks compared to U-Net. Mask R-CNN with the dilation operator achieved a precision of 98.7%, recall of 99.7%, F1 score of 99.1%, and intersection over union (IoU) of 74.8% for the test orthophoto. U-Net, on the other hand, has achieved a recall of 93.3%, precision of 97.2%, F1 score of 95.2%, and IoU of 58.3% when run with the dilation operator. Mask R-CNN was able to produce successful results in challenging areas. U-Net, on the other hand, showed a tendency to overlook existing trees rather than generate false alarms.

            Building segmentation has numerous application areas such as urban planning and disaster management. In this study, 12 CNN models (U-Net, FPN, and LinkNet using EfficientNet-B5 backbone, U-Net, SegNet, FCN, and six Residual U-Net models) were generated and used for building segmentation. Inria Aerial Image Labeling Data Set was used to train models, and three data sets (Inria Aerial Image Labeling Data Set, Massachusetts Buildings Data Set, and Syedra Archaeological Site Data Set) were used to evaluate trained models. On the Inria test set, Residual-2 U-Net has the highest F1 and Intersection over Union (IoU) scores with 0.824 and 0.722, respectively. On the Syedra test set, LinkNet-EfficientNet-B5 has F1 and IoU scores of 0.336 and 0.246. On the Massachusetts test set, Residual-4 U-Net has F1 and IoU scores of 0.394 and 0.259. It has been observed that, for all sets, at least two of the top three models used residual connections. Therefore, for this study, residual connections are more successful than conventional convolutional layers.

            Quantitative estimation of crop nitrogen is the key to site-specific management for enhanced nitrogen (N) use efficiency and a sustainable crop production system. As an alternate to the conventional approach through wet chemistry, sensor-based noninvasive, rapid, and near-real-time assessment of crop N at the field scale has been the need for precision agriculture. The present study attempts to predict leaf N of wheat crop through spectroscopy using a field portable spectroradiometer (spectral range of 400–2500 nm) on the ground in the crop field and an imaging spectrometer (spectral range of 400–1000 nm) from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with the objectives to evaluate (1) four multivariate spectral models (i.e., artificial neural network, extreme learning machine [ELM], least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, and support vector machine regression) and (2) two sets of hyperspectral data collected from two platforms and two different sensors. In the former part of the study, ELM outperforms the other methods with maximum calibration and validation R2 of 0.99 and 0.96, respectively. Furthermore, the image data set acquired from UAV gives higher performance compared to field spectral data. Also, significant bands are identified using stepwise multiple linear regression and used for modeling to generate a wheat leaf N map of the experimental field.

            It is important to determine car density in parking lots, especially in hospitals, large enterprises, and residential areas, which are used intensively, in terms of executing existing management systems and making precise plans for the future. In this study, cars in parking lots were detected using high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images with deep learning methods. We tested the performance of the two approaches by determining the number of cars in a parking lot using the You Only Look Once (YOLOv3) and Mask Region–Based Convolutional Neural Networks (Mask R-CNN) approaches as deep learning methods and the deep learning tool of Esri ArcGIS Pro. High-resolution UAV images were processed by photogrammetry and used as input products for the R-CNN and YOLOv3 algorithm. Recall, F1 score, precision ratio/uncertainty accuracy, and average producer accuracy of products automatically extracted with the algorithm were determined as 0.862/0.941, 0.874/0.946, 0.885/0.951, and 0.776/0.897 for R-CNN and YOLOv3, respectively.

            The classification and mapping accuracy of urban land cover and land use has always been a critical topic and several auxiliary data have been used to improve the classification accuracy. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is limited knowledge of the addition of airborne Light Detection and Ranging (lidar)-Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and Topographic Position Index (TPI) for urban land cover and land use classification and mapping. The aim of this study was to explore the addition of airborne lidar-DEM and derived TPI to reflect data of Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) in improving the classification accuracy of urban land cover and land use map- ping. Specifically, this study explored the mapping accuracies of urban land cover and land use classifications derived using: 1) standalone Landsat OLI satellite data; 2) Landsat OLI with acquired airborne lidar-DEM ; 3) Landsat OLI with TPI ; and 4) Landsat OLI with airborne lidar-DEM and derived TPI. The results showed that the addition of airborne lidar-DEM and TPI yielded the best overall urban land cover and land use classification accuracy of about 88%. The findings in this study demonstrated that both lidar-DEM and TPI had a positive impact in improving urban land cover and land use classification.

            Building height information is essential for many applications such as urban planning and population density estimation. The building shadow length varies according to seasons, which is shown as different digital number values in multi-temporal images. Thus, the bi-temporal satellite remote sensing images of Sentinel-2 are used to estimate the buildings height in this study. An area of 15 km × 15 km in Beijing, China is taken as the study area. By preprocessing the data, the remaining pixels are split into two parts: 70% as the training data set and the rest as the testing data set. Then, one classification model and three regression models are proposed with using Random Forest (RF) method. Based on the testing data, it shows that the accuracy rate of the classification model has reached 98.4% with the kappa coefficient of 0.93. And the regression models' root-mean-square error (RMSE) is 0.61 floor for 1–6 floors group, 0.41 floor for 7–12 floor group, and 0.98 floor for above 12 floor group. The final RMSE is 1.62 floor with RF models. In general, this study shows the feasibility of using satellite mid-resolution optical image to estimate the building height and provides an important reference for regional building height estimation in the future.

            This study presents a method to generate historical orthomosaics using Structure-from-Motion (SfM ) photogrammetry, historical aerial photographs, and lidar data, and then analyzes the horizontal accuracy and factors that can affect the quality of historical orthoimagery products made with these approaches. Two sets of historical aerial photographs (1934 and 1951) were analyzed, focused on the town of Woodstock in Connecticut, U.S.A. Ground control points (GCPs) for georeferencing were obtained by overlaying multiple data sets, including lidar elevation data and derivative hillshades, and recent orthoimagery. Root-Mean-Square Error values of check points (CPs ) for 1934 and 1951 orthomosaics without extreme outliers are 0.83 m and 1.37 m, respectively. Results indicate that orthomosaics can be used for standard mapping and geographic information systems (GIS ) work according to the ASPRS 1990 accuracy standard. In addition, results emphasize that three main factors can affect the horizontal accuracy of orthomosaics: (1) types of CPs, (2) the number of tied photos, and (3) terrain.

            Rapid urbanization has become an immense problem in Lahore city, causing various socio-economic and environmental problems. Therefore, it is noteworthy to monitor land use/land cover (LULC) change detection and future LULC patterns in Lahore. The present study focuses on evaluating the current extent and modeling the future LULC developments in Lahore, Pakistan. Therefore, the semi-automatic classification model has been applied for the classification of Landsat satellite imagery from 2000 to 2020. And the Modules of Land Use Change Evaluation (MOLUSCE) cellular automata (CA-ANN) model was implemented to simulate future land use trends for the years 2030 and 2040. This study project made use of Landsat, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model, and vector data. The research methodology includes three main steps: (i) semi-automatic land use classification using Landsat data from 2000 to 2020; (ii) future land use prediction using the CA-ANN (MOLUSCE) model; and (iii) monitoring change detection and interpretation of results. The research findings indicated that there was a rise in urban areas and a decline in vegetation, barren land, and water bodies for both the past and future projections. The results also revealed that about 27.41% of the urban area has been increased from 2000 to 2020 with a decrease of 42.13% in vegetation, 2.3% in barren land, and 6.51% in water bodies, respectively. The urban area is also expected to grow by 23.15% between 2020 and 2040, whereas vegetation, barren land, and water bodies will all decline by 28.05%, 1.8%, and 12.31%, respectively. Results can also aid in the long-term, sustainable planning of the city. It was also observed that the majority of the city's urban area expansion was found to have occurred in the city's eastern and southern regions. This research also suggests that decision-makers and municipal Government should reconsider city expansion strategies. Moreover, the future city master plans of 2050 must emphasize the relevance of rooftop urban planting and natural resource conservation.
