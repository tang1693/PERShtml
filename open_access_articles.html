            Hyperspectral sensors provide near-continuous spectral data that can facilitate advancements in agricultural crop classification and characterization, which are important for addressing global food and water security issues. We investigated two new-generation hyperspectral sensors, Germany’s Deutsches Zentrum für Luft‐ und Raumfahrt Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer (DESIS) and Italy’s PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA), within California???s Central Valley in August 2021 focusing on five irrigated agricultural crops (alfalfa, almonds, corn, grapes, and pistachios). With reference data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Cropland Data Layer, we developed a spectral library of the crops and classified them using three machine learning algorithms (support vector machines [SVM], random forest [RF], and spectral angle mapper [SAM]) and two philosophies: 1. Full spectral analysis (FSA) and 2. Optimal hyperspectral narrowband (OHNB) analysis. For FSA, we used 59 DESIS four-bin product bands and 207 of 238 PRISMA bands. For OHNB analysis, 9 DESIS and 16 PRISMA nonredundant OHNBs for studying crops were selected. FSA achieved only 1% to 3% higher accuracies relative to OHNB analysis in most cases. SVM provided the best results, closely followed by RF. Using both DESIS and PRISMA image OHNBs in SVM for classification led to higher accuracy than using either image alone, with an overall accuracy of 99%, producer’s accuracies of 94% to 100%, and user???s accuracies of 95% to 100%.

            Riverbank lines change over time, causing loss of land and property. Accurate mapping of riverbank lines is essential for restoration and preservation. This paper presents a method to map riverbank lines by combining georeferenced orthoimages and lidar digital elevation model (DEM). This method uses the properties that lidar can provide elevations under trees and open water edges are visible in orthoimages to extract the planimetric locations of bank lines. The orthoimage pixels with less than 0.15% slope on the DEM were replaced by water pixels. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted using DEM, slope, and orthoimage bands. Training data of river body and the background were identified manually on the first three component images. An alpha matting–based method was implemented using the training data to extract the bank lines. Bankline using α value of 50% probability were statistically and visually better when compared to the manual bank lines.
