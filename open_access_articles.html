            Hyperspectral sensors provide near-continuous spectral data that can facilitate advancements in agricultural crop classification and characterization, which are important for addressing global food and water security issues. We investigated two new-generation hyperspectral sensors, Germany’s Deutsches Zentrum für Luft‐ und Raumfahrt Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer (DESIS) and Italy’s PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA), within California???s Central Valley in August 2021 focusing on five irrigated agricultural crops (alfalfa, almonds, corn, grapes, and pistachios). With reference data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Cropland Data Layer, we developed a spectral library of the crops and classified them using three machine learning algorithms (support vector machines [SVM], random forest [RF], and spectral angle mapper [SAM]) and two philosophies: 1. Full spectral analysis (FSA) and 2. Optimal hyperspectral narrowband (OHNB) analysis. For FSA, we used 59 DESIS four-bin product bands and 207 of 238 PRISMA bands. For OHNB analysis, 9 DESIS and 16 PRISMA nonredundant OHNBs for studying crops were selected. FSA achieved only 1% to 3% higher accuracies relative to OHNB analysis in most cases. SVM provided the best results, closely followed by RF. Using both DESIS and PRISMA image OHNBs in SVM for classification led to higher accuracy than using either image alone, with an overall accuracy of 99%, producer’s accuracies of 94% to 100%, and user???s accuracies of 95% to 100%.

            Riverbank lines change over time, causing loss of land and property. Accurate mapping of riverbank lines is essential for restoration and preservation. This paper presents a method to map riverbank lines by combining georeferenced orthoimages and lidar digital elevation model (DEM). This method uses the properties that lidar can provide elevations under trees and open water edges are visible in orthoimages to extract the planimetric locations of bank lines. The orthoimage pixels with less than 0.15% slope on the DEM were replaced by water pixels. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted using DEM, slope, and orthoimage bands. Training data of river body and the background were identified manually on the first three component images. An alpha matting–based method was implemented using the training data to extract the bank lines. Bankline using α value of 50% probability were statistically and visually better when compared to the manual bank lines.

            Mapping distribution of alterations around porphyry copper deposits (PCDs) greatly affects mineral exploration. Diverse geological processes generate irregular alteration patterns with diverse spectral characteristics in mineral deposits. Applying remotely sensed hyperspectral images (HSIs) is an appealing technology for geologic surveyors to generate alteration maps. Conventional methods mainly use shallow spectral absorption features to discriminate minerals and cannot extract their important spectral information. Deep neural networks with nonlinear layers can evoke the deep spectral and spatial information of HSIs. Deep learning???based methods include fully connected neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and hybrid convolutional networks like mixed convolution neural network and covariance pooling (MCNN‐CP) algorithms. However, each has its advantages and limitations. To significantly avoid losing important spectral features, we proposed a new method by fusing a one‐dimensional convolutional neural network (1D‐CNN) with MCNN‐CP (1D‐MCNN‐CP), achieving an overall accuracy (97.44%) of mineral mapping from PRISMA HSIs. This research deduced that 1D‐MCNN‐CP improved performance and reduced misclassification errors among minerals sharing similar spectral features.

            Uncrewed aerial systems (UASs) have been used to collect “pseudo field plot” data in the form of large-scale stereo imagery to supplement and bolster direct field observations to monitor areas in Alaska. These data supplement field data that is difficult to collect in such a vast landscape with a relatively short field season. Dense photogrammetrically derived point clouds are created and are facilitated to extract land cover data using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier in this study. We test our approach using point clouds derived from 1-cm stereo imagery of plots in the Alaska North Slope region and compare the results to field observations. The results show that the overall accuracy of six land cover classes (bare soil, shrub, grass, forb/herb, rock, and litter) is 96.8% from classified patches. Shrub had the highest accuracy (>99%) and forb/herb achieved the lowest (<48%). This study reveals that the approach could be used as reference data to check field observations in remote areas.

            In ecologically vulnerable regions with intricate land use dynamics, such as ecotones, frequent and intense land use transitions unfold. Therefore, the precise and timely mapping of land use becomes imperative. With that goal, by using principal component analysis, we integrated Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, using an object-oriented methodology to craft a 10-meter-resolution land use map for the forest‐grassland ecological zone of the Greater Khingan Mountains spanning the years 2019 to 2021. Our research reveals a substantial enhancement in classification accuracy achieved through the integration of synthetic aperture radar‐optical remote sensing data. Notably, our products outperformed other land use/land cover data sets, excelling particularly in delineating intricate riverine wetlands. The 10-meter land use product stands as a pivotal guide, offering indispensable support for sustainable development, ecological assessment, and conservation endeavors in the Greater Khingan Mountains region.

            The ecosystem of Mosquito Lagoon, Florida, has been rapidly deteriorating since the 2010s, with a notable decline in keystone seagrass species. Seagrass is vital for many species in the lagoon, but nutrient overloading, algal blooms, boating, manatee grazing, and other factors have led to its loss. To understand this decline, a deep neural network analyzed Landsat imagery from 2000 to 2020. Results showed significant seagrass loss post-2013, coinciding with the 2011–2013 super algal bloom. Seagrass abundance varied annually, with the model performing best in years with higher seagrass coverage. While the deep learning method successfully identified seagrass, it also revealed that recent seagrass coverage is almost non-existent. This monitoring approach could aid in ecosystem recovery if coupled with appropriate policies for Mosquito Lagoon's restoration.

            In global navigation satellite systems (GNSS)-denied environments, vision-based methods are commonly used for the positioning and navigation of aerial robots. However, traditional methods often suffer from accumulative estimation errors over time, leading to trajectory drift and lack real-time performance, particularly in large-scale scenarios. This article presents novel approaches, including feature-based cross-view image matching and the integration of visual odometry and photogrammetric space resection for camera pose determination in real-time. Experimental evaluation with real UAV datasets demonstrated that the proposed method reliably matches features in cross-view images with large differences in spatial resolution, coverage, and perspective views, achieving a root-mean-square error of 4.7 m for absolute position error and 0.33° for rotation error, and delivering real-time performance of 12 frames per second (FPS) when implemented in a lightweight edge device onboard UAV. This approach offters potential for diverse intelligent UAV applications in GNSS-denied environments based on real-time feedback control.

            Currently, digital cameras and equipment used underwater are often inaccessible to the general public due to their professional-grade quality and high cost. Therefore alternative solutions have been sought that are both cost-effective and suitable for nonprofessional use. A review of the literature shows that researchers primarily use GoPro action cameras, while other action cameras with similar capabilities are rarely used. This study thus examines underwater photogrammetry methods using a widely recognized action camera as a reference and compares it with another camera of similar characteristics as a potential alternative. For a comprehensive temporal analysis in underwater studies, both cameras were used to capture photographic and video imagery, and the resulting 3D point clouds were compared. Comparison criteria included data collection and processing times, point cloud densities, cloud-to-cloud analysis, and assessments of surface density and roughness. Having analysed, the study concluded that the proposed alternative action camera can feasibly be used in underwater photogrammetry.

            This article presents recommendations and corresponding detailed procedures for the assessment of a geolocation system's accuracy, as well as the specification of accuracy requirements and their subsequent validation when they are available. Applicable metrics and related processing are based on samples of corresponding geolocation errors. This article also presents similar recommendations for the predicted accuracy of a geolocation system, based on samples of geolocation error, as well as corresponding predicted error covariance matrices associated with the geolocations. Reliable error covariance matrices enable optimal use of a geolocation system's products, such as the optimal fusion of multiple geolocations or multiple products for higher confidence and increased accuracy. The recommendations presented in this article enable reliable estimates of accuracy and reliable predicted accuracies, both of which are critical to many geolocation-based applications. The recommendations associated with predicted accuracy are also relatively new and innovative.

            The aim of the study is to identify factors affecting the sight-aesthetic value of the underwater landscapes of lakes for the purposes of exploration tourism. The reason for undertaking this topic is the lack of such studies for inland water bodies. The results will contribute to expanding and supplementing the knowledge on the assessment of the sight-aesthetic attractiveness of landscapes and fill gaps in knowledge about the underwater landscapes of lakes. The questionnaire survey implemented the direct comparison method described by Kendall (Kendall, M. G. 1970.Rank Correlation Methods. Charles Griffin and Co: Glasgow, Scotland). According to respondents, animals and submerged anthropogenic elements are the most visually attractive in an aquatic environment The results obtained are the reason for conducting further research and developing the methodology for the assessment of the sight-aesthetic value of inland bodies of water based on the experience of terrestrial landscape researchers.

            In terms of contribution to global food security, this study aimed to build a crop monitoring system for within-season yield prediction of US corn and soybeans by using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (time-series data, which consists of three essential core algorithms (crop phenology detection, early crop classification, and crop yield prediction methods)). Within-season predictions for 2018–2022 were then made to evaluate the perfor- mance of the proposed system by comparing it with the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) monthly forecasts and the fixed statistical data. The absolute percentage errors of the proposed system for predicting national-level yield and production were less than 5% for all simulation years as of day of year (DOY) 279. The prediction accuracy as of DOY 247 and DOY 279 were comparable to the USDA's forecasts. The proposed system would enable us to make a comprehensive understanding about overview of US corn and soybean crop condition by visualizing detail spatial pattern of good- or poor harvest regions on a within-season basis.

            Cultural heritage building information modeling (HBIM) is an emerging process allowing us to reconstruct built heritage virtually. The data of a digitally documented cultural heritage building offers significant advantages as it is accessible and modifiable by all professionals involved in the same or different projects. The most important factor affecting the accuracy and precision of the HBIM model is the ability to collect complete and accurate information about the physical structure. Combining terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry point clouds is one of the most efficient ways to capture accurate digital data on the building.

            The transformation of global navigation satellite systems coordi- nates between any two datums represents a vital procedure. Although the geocentric coordinates (X, Y, Z) of two datums can be trans- formed using the 7-parameters method, the conversion of Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projected coordinates (E, N) between two systems cannot be applied with the same procedure. However, see Jassim (2022), which discusses a method that allows the transformation between any two datums using the utm projected coordinates directly regarding the variation of the datum's semi-major axis and the eccentricity. The results of the evaluation of this method show that there is a significant shift in the transformed coordinates due to the imperfection of the used algorithm. While this research suggests a modification in the previous algorithm by adding the latitude's variation as a third significant factor besides the other two variations (∂a, ∂e2, and Δ), the suggested modification gives a high decline in the uncertainty of the position values. Furthermore, it takes a homogenous fixed limit for different places over Iraqi territory.

            Edge detection is highly susceptible to streaking caused by speckles in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) imagery. In this article, we address hysteresis thresholding for suppress streaking in PolSAR's edge detection. As an example, an approach is suggested by combining the constant false alarm ratio (CFAR) detector and the hysteresis thresholding. After thinning edges obtained by the CFAR detector, the hysteresis thresholding is employed to reduce edge streaking, which is caused by abundant speckles. A ratio of the high to the low threshold Pfain the hysteresis thresholding is pointed out for linking edges. Experiments are carried out on both simulated and real PolSAR data sets, and the results reveal that hysteresis thresh- olding obviously promotes the performance of the CFAR detector.

            Large-area land use land cover (LULC) mapping using high-resolution imagery remains challenging due to radiometric differences between scenes, the low spectral depth of the imagery, landscape heterogeneity, and computational limitations. Using a random forest (RF)- supervised machine-learning algorithm, we present a geographic object-based image analysis approach to classifying a large mosaic of 220 National Agriculture Imagery Program orthoimagery into lulc categories. The approach was applied in central Texas, USA, covering over 6000 km2. We generated 36 variables for each object and accounted for spatial structures of sample data to determine the distance at which samples were spatially independent. The final rf model produced 94.8% accuracy on independent stratified random samples. In addition, vegetation and water indices, the mean and standard deviation of principal components, and texture features improved classification accuracy. This study demonstrates a cost-effective way of producing an accurate multi-class land use/land cover map using high-spatial/low-spectral resolution orthoimagery.

            Bathymetric data, comprising elevations of submerged surfaces (e. g., seafloor or lake bed), constitute a critical need for a wide range of science and application focus areas, such as safety of marine navi- gation, benthic habitat mapping, flood inundation modeling, and coastal engineering. Over the past decade, the availability of near- shore bathymetric data has increased dramatically due to advances in satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB). One notable advance occurred with the 2018 launch of NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2), carrying the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS). However, much like other Earth observing satellites, ATLAS is often hampered by obstructions, such as clouds, which block the sensor's view of the Earth's surface. In this study, we introduce the Deep Occlusion Recovery of Satellite Lidar From ICESat-2 Network (DORSL-FIN) to recover partially occluded bathymetric profiles. We show that DORSL-FIN is able to accurately recover occluded bathymetry and outperforms other methods of interpolation.

            Edge detection in high-spatial-resolution remote sensing images (HSRIs ) is a key technology for automatic extraction, analysis, and understanding of image information. With respect to the problem of fake edges in image edge detection caused by image noise and the phenomenon of the same class objects reflecting different spectra, this article proposes a novel edge detection method for HSRIs by combin- ing superpixels with dual-threshold edge tracking. First, the image is smoothed using the simple linear iterative clustering algorithm to eliminate the influence of image noise and the phenomenon of the same class objects reflecting different spectra on image edge detec - tion. Second, initial edge detection results of the image are obtained using the dual-threshold edge tracking algorithm. Finally, the initial image edge detection results are post-processed by removing the burrs and extracting skeleton lines to obtain accurate edge detection results. The experimental results confirm that the proposed method outperforms the others and can obtain smooth, continuous, and single-pixel response edge detection results for HSRIs .

            Impervious surfaces are an essential component of our environment and are mainly triggered by human developments. Rapid urbanization and population expansion have increased Lahore's urban impervious surface area. This research is based on estimating the urban imper- vious surface area ( uisa ) growth from 1993 to 2022. Therefore, we aimed to generate an accurate urban impervious surfaces area map based on Landsat time series data on Google Earth Engine ( gee ). We have used a novel global impervious surface area index ( gisai ) for impervious surface area ( uisa ) extraction. The gisai accomplished significant results, with an average overall accuracy of 90.93% and an average kappa coefficient of 0.78. We also compared the results of gisai with Global Human Settlement Layer-Built and harmonized nighttime light ( ntl ) isa data products. The accuracy assessment and cross-validation of uisa results were performed using ground truth data on ArcGIS and gee. Our research findings revealed that the spatial extent of uisa increased by 198.69 km2from 1993 to 2022 in Lahore. Additionally, the uisa has increased at an average growth rate of 39.74 km2. The gisai index was highly accurate at extract- ing uisa and can be used for other cities to map impervious surface area growth. This research can help urban planners and policymak- ers to delineate urban development boundaries. Also, there should be controlled urban expansion policies for sustainable metropolis and should use less impermeable materials for future city developments.

            For remorte sensing image object detection tasks in the small object feature, extraction ability is insufficient and difficult to locate, and other problems. This paper proposes an improved algorithm for small object detection in remote sensing images based on a window self-attention mechanism. On the basis of You Only Look Once (YOLO)v5s, a shallow feature extraction layer with four times downsampling is added to the feature fusion pyramid and the window self-attention mechanism is added to the Path Aggregation Network. Experiments show that the improved model obtained the Mean Average Precision (mAP) of 78.3% and 91.8% on the DIOR and Remote Sensing Object Detection public data sets with frames per second of 65 and 51, respectively. Compared with the basal YOLOv5s network, the mAP has improved by 5.8% and 3.3%, respectively. Compared with other object detection methods, the detection accuracy and real-time performance have been improved.

            This study aims at applying the improved You Only Look Once V5s model for the assessment of regional poverty using remote sensing image target detection. The model was improved from structure, algorithm, and components. Objects in the remote sensing images were used to identify poverty, and the poverty alleviation situation could be predicted according to the existing detection results. The results showed that the values of Precision, Recall, mean Average Precision (mAP)@0.5, and[email protected]:0.95 of the model increased 7.3%, 0.7%, 1%, and 7.2%, respectively on the Common Objects in Context data set in the detection stage; the four values increased 3.1%, 2.2%, 1.3%, and 5.7%, respectively on the custom remote sensing image data set in the verification stage. The loss values decreased 2.6% and 37.4%, respectively, on the two data sets. Hence, the application of the improved model led to the more accurate detection of the targets. Compared with the other papers, the improved model in this paper proved to be better. Artificial poverty alleviation can be replaced by remote sensing image processing because it is inexpensive, efficient, accurate, objective, does not require data, and has the same evaluation effect. The proposed model can be considered as a promising approach in the assessment of regional poverty.

            Deep learning (dl), especially convolutional neural networks (cnns), has been proven to be an excellent feature extractor and widely applied to hyperspectral image (hsi) classification. However, dl is a computationally demanding algorithm with many parameters and a high computational burden, which seriously restricts the deployment ofdl-basedhsiclassification algorithms on mobile and embedded systems. In this paper, we propose an extremely lightweight conditional three-dimensional (3D) hsi with a double-branch structure to solve these problems. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight conditional 3D convolution to replace the conventional 3D convolution to reduce the computational and memory cost of the network and achieve flexiblehsifeature extraction. Then, based on lightweight conditional 3D convolution, we build two parallel paths to independently exploit and optimize the diverse spatial and spectral features. Furthermore, to precisely locate the key information, which is conducive to classification, a lightweight attention mechanism is carefully designed to refine extracted spatial and spectral features, and improve the classification accuracy with less computation and memory costs. Experiments on three publichsidata sets show that the proposed model can effectively reduce the cost of computation and memory, achieve high execution speed, and better classification performance compared with several recent dl-based models.

            Building extraction from high-resolution remote sensing images benefits various practical applications. However, automation of this process is challenging due to the variety of building surface coverings, complex spatial layouts, different types of structures, and tree occlusion. In this study, we propose a multilayer perception network for building extraction from high-resolution remote sensing images. By constructing parallel networks at different levels, the proposed network retains spatial information of varying feature resolutions and uses the parsing module to perceive the prominent features of buildings, thus enhancing the model's parsing ability to target scale changes and complex urban scenes. Further, a structure-guided loss function is constructed to optimize building extraction edges. Experiments on multi-source remote sensing data sets show that our proposed multi-level perception network presents a superior performance in building extraction tasks.

            Post-hurricane damage assessments are often costly and time-consuming. Remotely sensed data provides a complementary method of data collection that can be completed comparatively quickly and at relatively low cost. This study focuses on 15 Florida counties impacted by Hurricane Michael (2018), which had category 5 strength winds at landfall. The present study evaluates the ability of aerial imagery collected to cost-effectively measure blue tarps on buildings for disaster impact and recovery. A support vector machine model classified blue tarp, and parcels received a damage indicator based on the model's prediction. The model had an overall accuracy of 85.3% with a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 96.7%. The model results indicated approximately 7% of all parcels (27 926 residential and 4431 commercial parcels) in the study area as having blue tarp present. The study results may benefit jurisdictions that lacked financial resources to conduct on-the-ground damage assessments.

            At the research points, the relationship between the Normalized Difference Vegetation and Normalized Green Red Difference indices is characterized by a determination coefficient equal to 0.52. The estimation of the emission of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide in the forest air at an altitude of 40 m above the level of the soil cover during the growing season showed differences in their values during the daytime and at night. The results helped determine promising methods of inventory of the carbon landfill forest area for aboveground woody biomass assessment based on data obtained from several sources and land forest estimation research. The research involved: 1) integration of an unmanned aerial vehicle -based digital camera and lidar sensors in order to optimize the efficiency and cost of data collection; 2) taking advantage of high-resolution aerial photographs and sparse lidar point clouds using an information fusion approach and the ability to compensate for their shortcomings.

            Aiming at the problem of rapid construction of a river three-dimensional 3D scene, this article integrates remote sensing, 3D modeling, and CityEngine technology to construct a 3D scene model reconstruction method of river water-land integration. The method includes intelligent extraction of underwater topography, refined modeling of hydraulic structures, and construction of a water-land integrated real scene model. Based on this method, the high-fidelity land-underwater seamless digital terrain and the water-land 3D real scene models can be formed. Through experiments, the feasibility and limitations of this method are verified. It can effectively extract the shallow underwater terrain of inland rivers, and the overall accuracy of the study area is less than 2 m. The performance of the seamless fusion 3D terrain is better than the public digital elevation model data set. In the inland basin of Class I to II water quality, it can meet the needs of intelligent perception of a river- and lake-integrated 3D scene model.

            In this paper, an improved aerosol optical depth (AOD ) retrieval algorithm is proposed based on Sentinel-2 and AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET ) data. The surface reflectance for AOD retrieval was estimated from the image that had minimal aerosol contamination in a temporal window determined by AERONET data. Validation of the Sentinel-2 AOD retrievals was conducted against four Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET ) sites located in Beijing. The results show that the Sentinel-2 AOD retrievals are highly consistent with the AERONET AOD measurements (R = 0.942), with 85.56% falling within the expected error. The mean absolute error and the root-mean-square error are 0.0688 and 0.0882, respectively. In addition, the AOD distribution map obtained by this algorithm well reflects the fine-spatial-resolution changes in AOD distribution. These results suggest that the improved high-resolution AOD retrieval algorithm is robust and has the potential advantage of retrieving high-resolution AOD over urban areas.

            The detection of changes in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images based on deep learning has been widely used in landslides detection, flood disaster monitoring, and other fields of change detection due to its high classification accuracy. However, the inherent speckle noise in SAR images restricts the performance of existing SAR image change detection algorithms by clustering analysis. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel method for SAR image change detection based on clustering fusion and deep neural networks. We first used hierarchical fuzzy c-means clustering (HFCM ) to process two different images to obtain HFCM classification results. Then a fusion strategy is designed to obtain the fused image from the two HFCM classified images as the pre-classification result. Furthermore, a lightweight deep neural network com posed of a decomposition convolution module and an auxiliary classification module was proposed; the former module could reduce network parameters by 28%, and the latter could reduce network parameters by 33.3%. To improve the recognition performance of the network, the classification layer was replaced by the regression layer at the outcome of the network. By comparing the experiments of different methods on five data sets, the performance of our proposed method is superior.

            Strategies for Forest Height Estimation by High-Precision DEM Combined with Short-Wavelength PolInSAR TanDEM-X

            The purpose of this article is to explore forest height estimation strategies using topographic data (DEM) combined with TanDEM-X while comparing the effect of volume scattering complex coherence selection on forest height estimation in the traditional random volume over ground (RVoG) three-stage algorithm. In this study, four experimental strategies were designed for comparison based on TanDEM-X polarized interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PolInSAR) data, TanDEM-DEM, and 42 field-measured data. Our results show that in the RVoG model, (1) a reference ground phase to select the volume scattering complex coherence provides greater accuracy in determining forest height, (2) forest height estimation can be achieved by directly using DEM as ground phase information without relying on model solving and obtaining a more accurate forest height than TanDEM-X alone, and (3) the highest estimation accuracy is obtained by using DEM as coherence information among all schemes. Although the difference in forest height estimation results is not significant in this study, it still proves that the forest height estimation strategy of high-precision DEM combined with short-wavelength PolInSAR can not only improve the forest height estimation accuracy but also simplify the solving process of the RVoG model, which is an important reference for global forest parameter estimation and ecosystem detection based on spaceborne PolInSAR.
