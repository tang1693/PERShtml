Efficient Coral Survey Using Aerial Remote Sensing and Multi-modal Segmentation for Large-Scale Ecological Assessment,"Qin, Jiangying; 1; Li, Ming; 2; Armin, Gruen; 3; Gong, Jianya; 4; Zhong, Jiageng; 2; Liao, Xuan; 5","April 1, 2025",Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asprs/pers/pre-prints/content-25-00007,"Due to the ecological pressures of global warming and human activities in coastal regions, coral reef ecosystems, predominantly located in shallow marine areas, are facing severe threats to their survival. Scientists and governmental managers are eager to leverage novel aerial remote sensing technologies to address the challenges of acquiring accurate, comprehensive, and timely data on coral reef health, structural complexity, and spatial distribution. This study aims to tackle these challenges by using precise and accurate aerial remote sensing data to support the restoration and sustainable prosperity of coral reef systems. Specifically, this study develops and applies an efficient coral survey method based on aerial remote sensing. The method integrates aerial imagery and bathymetric lidar (light detection and ranging) point cloud data and uses advanced photogrammetric computer vision and deep learning algorithms. Using a state-of-the-art multi-modal neural network segmentation technique, the proposed method enables high-precision and intelligent identification of coral reefs, facilitating detailed habitat mapping. Furthermore, by accurately delineating the habitat range and geometric structures of reefs, this approach allows for precise measurements of coral biomass production and skeletal calcification. These metrics help assess coral reef structural complexity and their adaptability to environmental stressors, providing robust scientific data for conservation strategies and policy making. The use of advanced multi-modal aerial remote sensing data not only enhances monitoring reliability and accuracy but also offers a cost-effective and flexible tool for coral reef ecological mapping. This approach effectively addresses challenges encountered in coastal ecological surveys, particularly in areas where direct human access or boat entry is difficult."
Analysis of Landslide Susceptibility of the Darjeeling District Using a Frequency Ratio Model and Geographical Weighted Regression,"Sen, Suhel; 1; Sarif, Md. Omar; 2; 3","April 30, 2025",Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asprs/pers/pre-prints/content-24-00049,"India yearly experiences natural disasters such as floods, droughts, cyclones, and landslides, which not only disrupt but also significantly affect the socioeconomic activities of its people. Darjeeling, one of the most valuable districts of West Bengal, India, is located in the foothills of the mighty Himalayas. Landslides in Darjeeling, particularly during the monsoon season, severely affect the socioeconomic conditions of the local population. This research creates a landslide susceptibility map of Darjeeling using the frequency ratio model (FRM) and geographical weighted regression (GWR). The study considers 16 landslide-conditioning factors and 743 past landslide events, of which 70% are used for modeling and the remaining 30% are used for validation. The generated landslide susceptibility map categorizes the area into very low, low, moderate, high, and very high susceptibility zones. Results show that most of the study area falls within the high susceptibility zone, covering approximately 28.45% of the region. The study also reveals that the northern hilly regions of the district are more prone to landslides compared with the southern part, based on FRM and GWR. The area under curve indicates that the model achieved a 74.7% success rate. The highest value of the landslide density index was found in areas classified as having very high landslide susceptibility. Therefore, considering the landslide susceptibility, implementation of effective management strategies is essential for ensuring the future development of the district."
Phase Center Extraction of Corner Reflector Points in Single-Look Complex Image,N/A,"April 8, 2025",Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asprs/pers/pre-prints/content-24-00101,"The geometric calibration accuracy of the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) system is affected by the extraction accuracy of Corner Reflector (CR) points in a Single-Look Complex (SLC) image. There are some problems in traditional artificial extraction methods for CR points, such as the difficulty of identifying CR points without prior knowledge, low efficiency, and limited extraction accuracy. An extraction method of the phase center for CR points without prior knowledge was proposed in this paper through the construction of a geometric error compensation model for SAR images and the study of high precision fitting methods of the phase center for CR points. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by the Gaofen-3 (GF-3) satellite image data. Experimental results demonstrated that the extraction accuracy of CR points could be better than 0.2 pixel for GF-3 images."
A High-Quality Underwater 3D Reconstruction Solution for Coral Reef Environments Leveraging Advanced Photogrammetric Computer Vision Techniques,N/A,"April 7, 2025",Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asprs/pers/pre-prints/content-24-00156,"Coral reefs, with their intricate 3D structures, are vital marine ecosystems increasingly threatened by environmental stressors. Accurate 3D reconstruction of these underwater structures is essential for scientific research and conservation management. While underwater photogrammetry has emerged as a promising tool for this purpose, technical challenges persist in capturing fine-scale features under underwater conditions, particularly the intricate morphology of coral reefs and the highly complex textures that hinder high-fidelity reconstruction. Recent breakthroughs in computer vision and deep learning have introduced new opportunities for underwater photogrammetry. This study begins by outlining a photogrammetric workflow that can integrate current advanced technologies, followed by summarizing cutting-edge methods used in the key stages, i.e., sparse and dense reconstruction. Building on previous research, we propose a hierarchical reconstruction strategy for accurate and efficient dense modeling. Our approach first performs an efficient global coarse-grained reconstruction to capture the overall scene structure, followed by fine-scale modeling in key regions of interest. Using image data collected from a coral reef site at Moorea Island, we compare and evaluate various techniques, analyzing their respective strengths and limitations. In sparse reconstruction, the classical feature method scale-invariant feature transform demonstrates competitive performance. Deep learning–based methods, such as ALIKED feature and the SuperGlue matching network, achieve superior results on certain metrics. For dense reconstruction, Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting–based methods yield high-quality reconstructions but are computationally intensive. In contrast, the deep learning–based multi-view stereo approach achieves comparable reconstruction quality with greater efficiency. Experimental results on reconstruction result fusion further validate that our approach offers a scalable and practical solution for coral reef monitoring, advancing conservation science and ecosystem management practices."
Texture-Semantic Point: Registration for Point Clouds of Porcelain Relics,N/A,"April 8, 2025",Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asprs/pers/pre-prints/content-24-00116,"Point cloud models of porcelain are captured through the multi-registration of point clouds, which presents a challenging task. On the one hand, the smooth surface of porcelain lacks geometric feature variation, making it difficult to establish corresponding points. On the other hand, the overall geometric symmetry of most porcelain relics can easily lead to iterative calculations falling into the local minimum convergence trap. To address the difficulties in feature point selection, we propose a novel approach using texture-semantic points as features for coarse registration. We first select rich texture points as 2D candidates and establish a 2D-3D matching relationship, giving each candidate its 3D spatial location and associated texture information. Using these correspondences, we perform coarse alignment of the point clouds. However, in reality, the point clouds are not aligned, and the registration calculation fails because of geometric symmetry issues. To address this, we integrate a control net into the iterative closest point (ICP) calculation to guide iterations towards the correct Special Euclidean group in 3 dimensions (SE(3)) transformation, achieving refined alignment. Finally, considering porcelain’s symmetrical geometry, we introduce a pose optimization constraint using the symmetry axis as a weighted parameter to limit degrees of freedom and enhance registration accuracy. Experiments were conducted on seven porcelain datasets to evaluate the proposed approach. A qualitative analysis demonstrated successful refined alignment using the proposed approach. In addition, we performed a quantitative comparison with state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results showed that our approach outperformed others across all models when applied to the registration of geometrically symmetric porcelain; Specifically, the proposed method achieved a 50% enhancement in accuracy compared with others, measured by the distance between the labeled corresponding points.

Combined Use of Satellite Observations and the RIM for Assessing Recovery from Natural Disasters,N/A,"April 1, 2025",Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asprs/pers/pre-prints/content-pers_24-00050,"In this study, we explore using satellite observations to assess community recovery from natural disasters such as fires and hurricanes, supplementing the Resilience Inference Model (RIM). The RIM model has been successfully used to quantify recoveries from hurricanes along the Gulf Coast, but it relies on long-term population changes over years or decades. Our approach integrates satellite observations to enhance recovery assessment with a shorter latency of weeks or months. Using fire, vegetation, and night light data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) with daily global observations, Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite/Advanced Baseline Imager, we quantitatively evaluate fire intensity, light outage, and urban greenness changes, along with subsequent recovery, focusing on the 2023 Maui fire and selected hurricane cases along the Gulf Coast. This approach complements the RIM model by introducing quantifiable physical parameters with shorter latency, particularly beneficial in areas where census data are either unavailable or unreliable."
Leadership in COVID-19: Mitigation Strategies across Top 30 Gross Domestic Product Countries,"Ozdenerol, Esra; Bingham-Byrne, Rebecca Michelle","May 7, 2025",Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asprs/pers/pre-prints/content-24-00046,"This study analyzes COVID-19 response strategies in the top 30 gross domestic product countries from the first case until 30 September 2021, a period marked by increased vaccinations, the dominance of the Delta variant, and changing public health measures. We examined which mitigation efforts effectively reduced new cases and the viral reproduction rate. Vaccination policies, movement restrictions, and mask mandates were critical in reducing cases per million, while testing, public information, income support, and contact tracing were crucial for lowering the viral reproduction rate. Vaccination policies did not significantly affect the reproduction rate during implementation. The gender of leaders showed no significant effect on cases, deaths, or excess mortality, though female leaders generally implemented fewer isolation days and prioritized additional measures like movement restrictions and stay-at-home orders."
Spatiotemporal Continuous Shallow Water Bathymetry from a Kriged Kalman Filter,"Wang, Lei; 1; Liu, Hongxing; 2; Kang, Lei; 3; Su, Haibin; 4; Shu, Song; 5; Wang, Jun; 6","June 9, 2025",Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asprs/pers/pre-prints/content-24-00051,"In GIScience, problems of missing data in space or time are nontrivial. We implemented a Kriged Kalman filter (KKF)–based data interpolation and assimilation technique and tested it for mapping bathymetry at unsampled locations and times. This technique integrates the Kriging and Kalman filter computation frameworks to perform spatiotemporal data assimilation, which can produce spatially and temporally continuous bathymetric fields from samples that are scarce in space and time. The spatiotemporal bathymetric field over the estuary of the Yangtze River was mapped based on the four boat-based depth echo-sounding surveys conducted in 1982, 1997, 2002, and 2010. Our validation and verification analyses showed that the KKF assimilation model can predict bathymetry accurately and reliably at unsampled locations and times. This paper demonstrates that KKF is superior to traditional spatial interpolation methods because it informs the interpolator with the temporal component that also extends the prediction to the time domain. The experiments indicate that greater time intervals in conducting bathymetric surveys result in a more pronounced influence on the performance of KKF than the spatial sparsity of depth samples. The ability of space-time prediction of bathymetry allows underwater depth measurements to be accurately aligned with satellite images, which is essential for improving multispectral image inversion in bathymetry studies."
"Enhancing Residential Building Identification in a Coastal Texas City: An Integrated Framework Leveraging Remote Sensing, GIS, and Transfer Learning Techniques","Ye, Xinyue; 1; Bai, Weishan; 1; Huang, Xiao; 2","June 9, 2025",Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asprs/pers/pre-prints/content-24-00048,"Rapid urbanization and population growth have intensified the need for accurate and efficient identification of residential buildings in urban planning and disaster management. This paper presents a novel approach for identifying residential buildings by leveraging multiple source data and a transfer learning model, with a case study conducted in Galveston Island, Texas. We propose an integrated framework that combines very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery, lidar data, points of interest (POI) data, and GIS-based land use information to extract features of residential buildings. We fine-tune a pretrained deep learning model with our data sets to enhance the model’s adaptability and efficiency in detecting residential buildings in the study area. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high accuracy in identifying residential buildings, with overall accuracy of 85.6% in the case study. This study also offers valuable insights into the potential of combining multiple data sources and transfer learning techniques for improving residential building identification and other related tasks in urban remote sensing applications."
Lyme Disease Risk Map and Prioritizing Areas for Vaccine Deployment,"Bingham-Byrne, Rebecca Michelle; Ozdenerol, Esra","May 18, 2025",Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asprs/pers/pre-prints/content-2400045a,"Disease surveillance, including risk modeling, is beneficial for infectious diseases. Risk prediction maps can be used to prioritize areas to deliver vaccines reducing disease transmission. For zoonotic infectious diseases such as Lyme disease, potential vaccine deployment areas include cost-effective places key to vectors, wildlife hosts, and humans. This paper uses machine-learning techniques to develop models to predict Lyme disease risk, then uses the critical variables within the models, as well those considered principal from previous literature, to create a Lyme disease risk map and to prioritize areas for wildlife vaccine deployment. It was found that highest disease risk is in the eastern United States, especially the upper Midwest and Northeast regions, which coincides with previous literature. The study found national parks and counties within these areas to prioritize wildlife vaccine deployment. Future work includes ground-truthing of the risk map and dispersal of vaccine to priority areas."
