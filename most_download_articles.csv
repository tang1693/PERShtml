"10.14358/pers.77.2.125","3D Building Model Reconstruction from Multi-view Aerial Imagery a...: Ingenta Connect","A novel approach by integrating multi-view aerial imagery and lidar data is proposed to reconstruct 3D building models with accurate geometric position and fine details. First, a new algorithm is introduced for determination of principal orientations of a building, thus benefiting to improve the correctness and robustness of boundary segment extraction in aerial imagery. A new dynamic selection strategy based on lidar point density analysis and K-means clustering is then proposed to identify boundary segments from non-boundary segments. Second, 3D boundary segments are determined by incorporating lidar data and the 2D segments extracted from multi-view imagery. Finally, a new strategy for 3D building model reconstruction including automatic recovery of lost boundaries and robust reconstruction of rooftop patches is introduced. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach can provide high quality 3D models with high-correctness, high-completeness, and good geometric accuracy.","Cheng, Liang, Gong, Jianya, Li, Manchun, Liu, Yongxue","N/A","N/A","https://doi.org/10.14358/pers.77.2.125"
"10.14358/pers.86.1.23","3D Iterative Spatiotemporal Filtering for Classification of Multi...: Ingenta Connect","The current practice in land cover/land use change analysis relies heavily on the individually classified maps of the multi-temporal data set. Due to varying acquisition conditions (e.g., illumination, sensors, seasonal differences), the classification maps yielded are often inconsistent through time for robust statistical analysis. 3D geometric features have been shown to be stable for assessing differences across the temporal data set. Therefore, in this article we investigate the use of a multi-temporal orthophoto and digital surface model derived from satellite data for spatiotemporal classification. Our approach consists of two major steps: generating per-class probability distribution maps using the random-forest classifier with limited training samples, and making spatiotemporal inferences using an iterative 3D spatiotemporal filter operating on per-class probability maps. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can consistently improve the individual classification results by 2%â€“6% and thus can be an important postclassification refinement approach.","Albanwan, Hessah, Qin, Rongjun, Lu, Xiaohu, Li, Mao, Liu, Desheng, Guldmann, Jean-Michel","N/A","N/A","https://doi.org/10.14358/pers.86.1.23"
"10.14358/pers.76.12.1373","3D SAR Simulation of Urban Areas Based on Detailed Building Model...: Ingenta Connect","This paper confirms the need for detailed 3D models for the simulation of high-resolution SAR images in order to support Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) focused on single urban objects. Using a building model enhanced by facade grammar, multiple reflections at building facades are analyzed using ray tracing techniques and scatterers are localized in azimuth, range, and elevation. In a case study, salient signatures of a TerraSAR-X image are analyzed based on simulated SAR reflectivity maps. Phase centers of trihedral reflections are mapped onto the building model and the physical correspondence of scatterers to building features is investigated. Surfaces contributing to salient scatterers are identified at the building model. Eventually, the use of SAR simulation to support PSI is shown from two aspects: (a) for providing a-priori information about building layover, and (b) for extending knowledge about the nature of dominant scatterers.","Auer, Stefan, Balz, Timo, Becker, Susanne, Bamler, Richard","N/A","N/A","https://doi.org/10.14358/pers.76.12.1373"

The method includes intelligent extraction of underwater topography, refined modeling of hydraulic structures, and construction of a water-land integrated real scene model. Based on this method, the high-fidelity land-underwater seamless digital terrain and the water-land 3D real scene models can be formed. Through experiments, the feasibility and limitations of this method are verified. It can effectively extract the shallow underwater terrain of inland rivers, and the overall accuracy of the study area is less than 2 m. The performance of the seamless fusion 3D terrain is better than the public digital elevation model data set. In the inland basin of Class I to II water quality, it can meet the needs of intelligent perception of a river- and lake-integrated 3D scene model.","Ruan, Xiaoguang, Yang, Fanghao, Guo, Meijing, Zou, Chao","N/A","N/A","https://doi.org/10.14358/pers.22-00127r2"
