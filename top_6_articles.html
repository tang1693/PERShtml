            Rapid urbanization has become an immense problem in Lahore city, causing various socio-economic and environmental problems. Therefore, it is noteworthy to monitor land use/land cover (LULC) change detection and future LULC patterns in Lahore. The present study focuses on evaluating the current extent and modeling the future LULC developments in Lahore, Pakistan. Therefore, the semi-automatic classification model has been applied for the classification of Landsat satellite imagery from 2000 to 2020. And the Modules of Land Use Change Evaluation (MOLUSCE) cellular automata (CA-ANN) model was implemented to simulate future land use trends for the years 2030 and 2040. This study project made use of Landsat, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model, and vector data. The research methodology includes three main steps: (i) semi-automatic land use classification using Landsat data from 2000 to 2020; (ii) future land use prediction using the CA-ANN (MOLUSCE) model; and (iii) monitoring change detection and interpretation of results. The research findings indicated that there was a rise in urban areas and a decline in vegetation, barren land, and water bodies for both the past and future projections. The results also revealed that about 27.41% of the urban area has been increased from 2000 to 2020 with a decrease of 42.13% in vegetation, 2.3% in barren land, and 6.51% in water bodies, respectively. The urban area is also expected to grow by 23.15% between 2020 and 2040, whereas vegetation, barren land, and water bodies will all decline by 28.05%, 1.8%, and 12.31%, respectively. Results can also aid in the long-term, sustainable planning of the city. It was also observed that the majority of the city's urban area expansion was found to have occurred in the city's eastern and southern regions. This research also suggests that decision-makers and municipal Government should reconsider city expansion strategies. Moreover, the future city master plans of 2050 must emphasize the relevance of rooftop urban planting and natural resource conservation.

            It is important to determine car density in parking lots, especially in hospitals, large enterprises, and residential areas, which are used intensively, in terms of executing existing management systems and making precise plans for the future. In this study, cars in parking lots were detected using high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images with deep learning methods. We tested the performance of the two approaches by determining the number of cars in a parking lot using the You Only Look Once (YOLOv3) and Mask Region–Based Convolutional Neural Networks (Mask R-CNN) approaches as deep learning methods and the deep learning tool of Esri ArcGIS Pro. High-resolution UAV images were processed by photogrammetry and used as input products for the R-CNN and YOLOv3 algorithm. Recall, F1 score, precision ratio/uncertainty accuracy, and average producer accuracy of products automatically extracted with the algorithm were determined as 0.862/0.941, 0.874/0.946, 0.885/0.951, and 0.776/0.897 for R-CNN and YOLOv3, respectively.

            Quantitative estimation of crop nitrogen is the key to site-specific management for enhanced nitrogen (N) use efficiency and a sustainable crop production system. As an alternate to the conventional approach through wet chemistry, sensor-based noninvasive, rapid, and near-real-time assessment of crop N at the field scale has been the need for precision agriculture. The present study attempts to predict leaf N of wheat crop through spectroscopy using a field portable spectroradiometer (spectral range of 400–2500 nm) on the ground in the crop field and an imaging spectrometer (spectral range of 400–1000 nm) from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with the objectives to evaluate (1) four multivariate spectral models (i.e., artificial neural network, extreme learning machine [ELM], least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, and support vector machine regression) and (2) two sets of hyperspectral data collected from two platforms and two different sensors. In the former part of the study, ELM outperforms the other methods with maximum calibration and validation R2 of 0.99 and 0.96, respectively. Furthermore, the image data set acquired from UAV gives higher performance compared to field spectral data. Also, significant bands are identified using stepwise multiple linear regression and used for modeling to generate a wheat leaf N map of the experimental field.

            Monitoring trees is necessary to manage and take inventory of forests, monitor plants in urban areas, distribute vegetation, monitor change, and establish sensitive and renewable agricultural systems. This study aims to automatically detect, count, and map apricot trees in an orthophoto, covering an area of approximately 48 ha on the ground surface using two different algorithms based on deep learning. Here, Mask region-based convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) and U-Net models were run together with a dilation operator to detect apricot trees in UAV images, and the performances of the models were compared. Results show that Mask R-CNN operated in this way performs better in tree detection, counting, and mapping tasks compared to U-Net. Mask R-CNN with the dilation operator achieved a precision of 98.7%, recall of 99.7%, F1 score of 99.1%, and intersection over union (IoU) of 74.8% for the test orthophoto. U-Net, on the other hand, has achieved a recall of 93.3%, precision of 97.2%, F1 score of 95.2%, and IoU of 58.3% when run with the dilation operator. Mask R-CNN was able to produce successful results in challenging areas. U-Net, on the other hand, showed a tendency to overlook existing trees rather than generate false alarms.

            The incessant rise of artificial surfaces has increased the temperatures of cities, distressing urban health and sustainability. Fast-growing tropical cities particularly call for an understanding of this phenomenon, known as the urban heat island (UHI). The present study was conducted to detect UHI dynamics over the National Capital Region of India. Stretching over more than 32 000 km2, this region consists of urban centers of varying sizes. Landsat thermal bands were processed to extract temperature patterns between 1999 and 2019. Urban climate change was prominent, as a 2349-km2expansion in UHI area was spotted. Urban clusters of different sizes were demarcated by applying the k-nearest neighbor algorithm on the normalized difference building index maps. This empirical analysis helped to form a logarithmic relation between city size and UHI intensity. Observed results set a framework to assess the thermal environment of numerous urban centers from any tropical country. UHI intensity values for various city sizes were computed, as they were crucial to decide the outdoor comfort zones based on the base temperature conditions of other cities. Further, the critical zones in each urban cluster were identified using the vegetation index, and scopes of landscaping were suggested based on the observed building morphologies of different local climate zones.

            The precise geo-positioning of high-resolution satellite imagery (HRSI) without ground control points (GCPs) is an important and fundamental step in global mapping, three-dimensional modeling, and so on. In this paper, to improve the efficiency of large-scale bundle adjustment (BA), we propose a combined Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) and Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) parallel computing approach for the BA of large-scale HRSI without GCPs. The proposed approach consists of three main components: 1) construction of a BA model without GCPs ; 2) reduction of memory consumption using the Compressed Sparse Row sparse matrix format; and 3) improvement of the computational efficiency by the use of the combined PCG and GPU parallel computing method. The experimental results showed that the proposed method: 1) consumes less memory consumption compared to the conventional full matrix format method; 2) demonstrates higher computational efficiency than the single-core, Ceres-solver and multi-core central processing unit computing methods, with 9.48, 6.82, and 3.05 times faster than the above three methods, respectively; 3) obtains comparable BA accuracy with the above three methods, with image residuals of about 0.9 pixels; and 4) is superior to the parallel bundle adjustment method in the reprojection error.
