                The aerodynamic roughness length (Z0m) serves an important role in the flux exchange between the land surface and atmosphere. In this study, airborne lidar (ALS), terrestrial lidar (TLS), and imaging spectroscopy data were integrated to develop and test two approaches to estimate Z0mover a shrub dominated dryland study area in south-central Idaho, USA. Sensitivity of the two parameterization methods to estimate Z0mwas analyzed. The comparison of eddy covariance-derived Z0mand remote sensing-derived Z0mshowed that the accuracy of the estimated Z0mheavily depends on the estimation model and the representation of shrub (e.g., Artemisia tridentata subsp. wyomingensis) height in the models. The geometrical method (RA1994) led to 9 percent (~0.5 cm) and 25% (~1.1 cm) errors at site 1 and site 2, respectively, which performed better than the height variability-based method (MR1994) with bias error of 20 percent and 48 percent at site 1 and site 2, respectively. The RA1994 model resulted in a larger range of Z0mthan the MR1994 method. We also found that the mean, median and 75th percentiles of heights (H75) fromALSprovides the best Z0mestimates in the MR1994 model, while the mean, median, andMLD(Median Absolute Deviation from Median Height), as well asAAD(Mean Absolute Deviation from Mean Height) heights fromALSprovides the best Z0mestimates in the RA1994 model. In addition, the fractional cover of shrub and grass, distinguished withALSand imaging spectroscopy data, provided the opportunity to estimate the frontal area index at the pixel-level to assess the influence of grass and shrub on Z0mestimates in the RA1994 method. Results indicate that grass had little effect on Z0min the RA1994 method. The Z0mestimations were tightly coupled with vegetation height and its local variance for the shrubs. Overall, the results demonstrate that the use of height and fractional cover from remote sensing data are promising for estimating Z0m, and thus refining land surface models at regional scales in semiarid shrublands.

            Impervious Comparison of NLCD versus a Detailed Dataset Over Time

                To address accuracy concerns of the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD), this case study compares impervious surface from theNLCDto a Detailed Land Cover Dataset (DLCD) for the Town of Blacksburg, Virginia over two time periods (2005/2006 and 2011) at spatial aggregation scales (30 m and 90 m) and scopes (site-specific to area-extent). When comparing the total impervious surface area, theNLCDoverestimated significant amounts (12 to 27 percent) for the entire town and across all specified land use zones (single family, multi-family, and non-residential) for both time periods examined. A binary pixel-wise accuracy assessment of impervious surface revealed that theNLCDperformed well for the multi-family and non-residential land use zones. However, accuracy level was quite low (user's accuracy <40 percent) for the single family land use zone. Percent impervious surface ofNLCDandDLCDwas further compared at 30 m and 90 m spatial scales. The spatial aggregation of pixels to 90 m led to improved agreement between the two datasets, althoughNLCDstill showed an underestimate of high values and an overestimate of low values. An empirical normalization equation was successfully applied to theNLCDto further reduce such data skewness.

            GPU-Accelerated Multiple Observer Siting

                We present two fast parallel implementations of the Franklin-Vogt multiple observer siting algorithm, using either OpenMP or CUDA. In this problem, the objective is to site observers on a raster terrain such that the joint area visible by them is maximized. On a portion of terrain with 16,385×16,385 cells, assuming that observers can see out to a radius-of-interest of 100 cells, finding the approximate 15,000 observers that have the greatest coverage takes only 17s in CUDA. That is a factor of 70 speedup from the sequential version. The OpenMP version exhibits a factor of 17 speedup on a 16 core system. Applications for the multiple observer siting problem include radio transmission towers, environmental monitoring sites, and path planning for surveillance drones. The algorithm has four steps: finding the visibility indices of all points, selecting a candidate subset of potential top observers, finding each one's viewshed, and greedily constructing the final solution.

            TM-Based SOC Models Augmented by Auxiliary Data for Carbon Crediting Programs in Semi-Arid Environments

                This study aimed at testing the hypothesis that augmenting Landsat TM-based models for predicting soil organic carbon (SOC) with auxiliary data about variables that might affect the spatial distribution ofSOCmight improve the predictability of these models in the Zarqa Basin in Jordan (a typical semi-arid watershed) and enable them to be used for implementing carbon crediting programs in semi-arid environments. Six modeling procedures, namely stepwise regression, partial least squares, recursive partitioning analysis, screening regression analysis, artificial neural networks, and combined models, were calibrated and validated for the basin and for the land cover types that exist in the basin. Although none of the developed models was powerful for predicting SOC, artificial neural networks models were more applicable specifically in agricultural lands. However, the margins of error associated with the best models were high, and hence hindered the applicability of these models in carbon crediting programs in semi-arid environments.
