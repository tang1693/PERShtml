                Unison of in situ data with satellite remote sensing data has been widely used for water body quality monitoring; however, the developed synergized model is unique and thus needs to be recalibrated and revalidated before applying to other water bodies. In some Indian locations, water quality monitoring is conducted only once a year due to associated costs and time. To aid such instances, in this study, stepwise linear regression models were developed using in situ (annual) and Landsat 7 (biweekly) remote sensing data and validated for two inland water bodies (Sursagar and Nalsarovar lakes) in Gujarat state for dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, electrical conductivity, pH, and nitrate. Results indicated that all models showed good to excellent performance metrics based on an r value (p < 0.01) ranging from 0.86 to 0.98 and 0.72 to 0.99 for Sursagar and Nalsarovar lakes, respectively. All models had root mean square errors less than 0.5, and residual predictive deviations greater than 2, which depicted good predictability. The models were able to increase the water quality assessment from annual resolution to biweekly resolution and provided insights on the dynamics of water quality parameters, improved understanding on key drivers for the change, and identified peak pollution leading to unfit conditions for domestic or agricultural consumption.

                In this paper, we present our workflow to automatically reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) building models based on two-dimensional building polygons and a lidar point cloud. The workflow generates models at different levels of detail (LoDs) to support data requirements of different applications from one consistent source. Specific attention has been paid to make the workflow robust to quickly run a new iteration in case of improvements in an algorithm or in case new input data become available. The quality of the reconstructed data highly depends on the quality of the input data and is monitored in several steps of the process. A 3D viewer has been developed to view and download the openly available 3D data at different LoDs in different formats. The workflow has been applied to all 10 million buildings of the Netherlands. The 3D service will be updated after new input data becomes available.

                This article proposes an estimation method for assessing urban sprawl using multispectral remote sensing data: SNPP-VIIRS, DMSP/OLS, Landsat 5-TM, and Landsat 8-OLI. This study focuses on the impacts of human activities, in terms of increased electrical-power consumption (EPC) due to urbanization. For this purpose, night-time light data are used to measure the EPC growth from 2000 to 2020. We also perform a suitability analysis using geographic information-systems techniques to propose a new urban town in Lahore to mitigate urbanization and EPC increase. We found an overall increase of 33% in urban area and an EPC increase of 21.6% in the last two decades. We also find that the best proposed site for the new urban town is in the northwest of Lahore.

                High-spatial-resolution satellite imagery enables transformational opportunities to observe, map, and document the micro-topographic transitions occurring in Arctic polygonal tundra at multiple spatial and temporal frequencies. Knowledge discovery through artificial intelligence, big imagery, and high-performance computing (HPC) resources is just starting to be realized in Arctic permafrost science. We have developed a novel high-performance image-analysis framework—Mapping Application for Arctic Permafrost Land Environment (MAPLE)—that enables the integration of operational-scale GeoAI capabilities into Arctic permafrost modeling. Interoperability across heterogeneous HPC systems and optimal usage of computational resources are key design goals of MAPLE. We systematically compared the performances of four different MAPLE workflow designs on two HPC systems. Our experimental results on resource utilization, total time to completion, and overhead of the candidate designs suggest that the design of an optimal workflow largely depends on the HPC system architecture and underlying service-unit accounting model.

                Since 2000, major changes have taken place in Wuhan city. Land use and land cover (LULC) has changed significantly, characterized by increased construction land, reducing farmland, grassland, and forest land due to the rapid urbanization process. Taking advantage of LULC data and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Net Primary Production (MODIS NPP) data from 2000 to 2020, we analyze the impact of LULC type transformation on NPP, reveal the relationship between LULC type and NPP, and quantify the impact of urban expansion on NPP by taking Wuhan, China as a study case. The results showed that: 1) the transformation from farmland and grassland to construction land was a dominant LULC change type in Wuhan during the investigated period; 2) there exists a significant negative correlation between NPP and changes in farmland, woodland, and grassland area; 3) the distance from the city center has a significant positive correlation with NPP, and the dynamics of NPP vary in different regions; 4) there is a significant positive correlation between NPP and night light data. The results of this study provide scientific references for the formation of greening construction and sustainable development strategies in Wuhan.

                In object-oriented information extraction from high-resolution remote sensing images, the segmentation and classification of images involves considerable manual participation, which limits the development of automation and intelligence for these purposes. Based on the multi-scale segmentation strategy and case-based reasoning, a new method for extracting high-resolution remote sensing image information by fully using the image and nonimage features of the case object is proposed. Feature selection and weight learning are used to construct a multi-level and multi-layer case library model of surface cover classification reasoning. Combined with image mask technology, this method is applied to extract surface cover classification information from remote sensing images using different sensors, time, and regions. Finally, through evaluation of the extraction and recognition rates, the accuracy and effectiveness of this method was verified.
