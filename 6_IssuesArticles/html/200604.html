                Laser scanning provides a good means to collect information on forest stands. This paper presents an approach to delineate single trees automatically in small footprint light detection and ranging (lidar) data in deciduous and mixed temperate forests. In rasterized laser data possible tree tops are detected with a local maximum filter. Afterwards the crowns are delineated with a combination of a pouring algorithm, knowledge-based assumptions on the shape of trees, and a final detection of the crown-edges by searching vectors starting from the trees’ tops. The segmentation results are assessed by comparison with terrestrial measured crown projections and with photogram-metrically delineated trees. The segmentation algorithm works well for coniferous stands. However, the implemented method tends to merge crowns in dense stands of deciduous trees.

                Stereoscopic perception is a basic requirement for photogrammetric 3D measurement and accurate geospatial data collection. Ordinary stereoscopic techniques require operators wearing glasses or using eyepieces for interpretation and measurement. However, the recent emerging autostereoscopic technology makes it possible to eliminate this requirement. This paper studies the principles and implementation of autostereoscopic photogrammetric measurement and evaluates its performance. We first describe the principles and properties of the parallax barrier-based autostereoscopic display used in this study. As an important metric property, we quantitatively present the autostereoscopic geometry, including viewing zones and the boundary of a viewer’s movement for autostereoscopic measurement. A toolkit AUTO3D is developed that has common photogrammetric functions. The implementation principles are described by addressing the differences compared to the ordinary stereoscopic technology. To evaluate the performance of the auto-stereoscopic measurement, images at a resolution of 25 m and 50 m are measured by a group of seven (7) operators, who are asked to digitize 18 well-defined roof points and 18 ground points. These results are evaluated by comparing the same measurements obtained from a popular stereoscopic photogrammetric workstation. It is shown that the precision of autostereoscopic measurement is about 16 percent to 25 percent lower than the conventional stereo workstation.

            Three New Implementations of the Triangular Prism Method for Computing the Fractal Dimension of Remote Sensing Images

                Based on Clarke’s (1986) triangular prism concept, this paper proposes three new methods to compute the fractal dimension(D)of remote sensing images. Our first method involves searching a pixel on each edge of a square whose digital numbers (DN) value has the largest deviation from the central pixel. Our second method uses a pixel on each edge of a square whose DN deviation from the central pixel is closest to the mean DN deviation from the central pixel to all pixels on the same edge. In our third method, eight pixels on the four edges of a square are used. Furthermore, common to the three proposed methods is the use of actual DN of the central pixel. The proposed computation methods have been tested using both simulated fractal surfaces and real images. Results show that the proposed methods appear to generally perform better than Clarke’s 1986 method for synthetic images with complex textures.

            Object-based Analysis of Ikonos-2 Imagery for Extraction of Forest Inventory Parameters

                A method is presented for deriving forest inventory information from Ikonos-2 imagery based on the analysis of image objects rather than more conventional pixel-based image analysis approaches. For a 77 km2study area in southwestern Alberta, Canada, image objects representing homogeneous landscape components were delineated from Ikonos-2 data using an image segmentation routine. Decision tree statistical analyses were used to identify correlations between metrics derived from spectral and spatial properties of the image objects and field-derived samples of individual forest inventory parameters. The strongest relationships were observed for classes of discrete land-cover types, species composition, and crown closure.

                An approach and strategy for automatic detection of buildings from aerial images using combined image analysis and interpretation techniques is described in this paper. It is undertaken in several steps. A dense DSM is obtained by stereo image matching and then the results of multi-band classification, the DSM, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) are used to reveal preliminary building interest areas. From these areas, a shape modeling algorithm has been used to precisely delineate their boundaries. The Dempster-Shafer data fusion technique is then applied to detect buildings from the combination of three data sources by a statistically-based classification. A number of test areas, which include buildings of different sizes, shape, and roof color have been investigated. The tests are encouraging and demonstrate that all processes in this system are important for effective building detection.

            PredictingSphaeropsis sapineaDamage inPinus radiataCanopies Using Spectral Indices and Spectral Mixture Analysis

                Maintaining the health and condition of the forest plantation estate is critical to ensuring there are no adverse losses in productivity. Within AustralianPinus radiataplantations a diverse range of damaging agents are present. One significant agent is a fungal pathogenSphaeropsis sapinea. In this research, we detail the development of relationships between a range of individual crown health attributes representing symptoms ofSphaeropsis sapineainfection and high spatial and spectral resolution remotely sensed imagery characteristics. To do this, two methods were used; the first utilized vegetation spectral indices including simple and normalized difference ratios, and the second, linear spectral mixture analysis. Results indicate that spectral indices that utilize either chlorophyll absorption wavelengths at 680 nm with a non-chlorophyll region of the spectrum (such as 710 or 750 nm) or the slope of the upper red-edge between 710 and 740 nm were most significantly related to individual crown damage attributes. Linear unmixing analysis consistently extracted four fraction endmember images (sunlit canopy, soil, shadow, and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV)) from the 12 channel imagery. Multiple linear stepwise regression models developed using mixed fractional abundances provided similar results to those derived using spectral indices. The NPV and shadow endmembers, in order, were consistently identified as the most significant in these developed models.
