                In this paper, a new visual localization method for a planetary rover's stereo vision system is presented, which is based on the weighted total least squares (WTLS) algorithm and Procrustes analysis. The main advantage of the new method is that the problem solution does not require any initial value of the planetary rover's pose parameters, or any linearization procedure. Moreover, the new method takes account of the problem that the coefficient matrix and observation vector of the relative orientation model should also be considered with regard to error during optimization. The results from China's first lunar rover and simulated stereo camera system demonstrate that the new method can enable the planetary rover to run in real time and achieve equal localization accuracy (with a mean relative localization accuracy of 4.59%), higher efficiency (with a computation time of 1 ms) and direct convergence compared with some classical methods.

                Mobile Mapping is the technique of acquiring accurate geospatial information of a scene using multiple sensors mounted on a moving platform. At the core of these systems is the direct georeferencing techniques that tie together multi-sensor data on-board. An important aspect of direct georeferencing is to apply accurate boresight calibration of individual sensors with respect to the platform body frame. Conventional techniques use Ground Control Points (GCP) for this calibration. Considering the challenges in identifyingGCPsfrom low density lidar point cloud, this research presents a feature-based registration method that uses control planes. The presented method is performed in a lab-facility utilizing static data to determine the alignment between platform body frame and lidar frame by minimizing the volume formed between low point density lidar and control planes. The paper discusses the mathematical models and feasibility of the technique for use in mapping applications.

                Image segmentation is a key technique involved in information extraction from high spatial resolution remote sensing images. Studying the impact of the evaluation method on the segmentation result is equally as important as studying the segmentation algorithm itself. However, research in segmentation evaluation is behind that of segmentation algorithms. Only a few review articles about segmentation evaluation were published in computer vision field. Therefore, reviewing segmentation evaluation methods used for high spatial resolution remote sensing images is of great significance. This paper summarizes widely used evaluation methods in remote sensing field, analyzes their advantages and shortcomings, and discusses their application range. Especially this paper uses series of experiments to demonstrate the supervised and unsupervised image segmentation evaluation process and analyzes the performance of some commonly used supervised and unsupervised evaluation indexes. Further, potential applications and possible future direction for high spatial resolution remote sensing image segmentation evaluation are finally summarized.

            The Effect of Terrestrial Surface Slope and Roughness on Laser Footprint Geolocation Error for Spaceborne Laser Altimeter

                The quality of spaceborne laser altimeter observation mainly depends on the geolocation accuracy of laser footprint. To thoroughly analyze the footprint geolocation errors, mathematical models of Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) of laser footprint geolocation are established based on footprint geolocation procedure and principle of error propagation. Taking Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) as an example, the influences of surface slope and roughness on theRMSEof laser footprint geolocation (LFG) are simulated. The simulation results for nine representative terrains indicate that the horizontal errors are constant of 5.86 meters that mainly caused by instrument mounting errors, laser pointing errors, and platform attitude errors; while the vertical error increases from 0.07 m to 2.49 m, which is primarily contributed by the laser pointing error. To validate the proposed mathematical model, 20 referenceLFGdifferences are computed by the differences of original geolocation ofGLASand refined footprint geolocation based on a waveform matching method with coincident airborne Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) data. The validated results prove that theRMSEmodels of laser footprint geolocation are applicable in evaluating performance and sensor error allocations of spaceborne laser altimeter.

            Assessing China's Lake Changes and Associated Driving Forces During 1985–2015

                China's lakes have experienced dramatic changes in recent decades, but quantitative information on such changes remains unclear. Here we present a national-scale investigation of lake changes in China during 1985 to 2015 and further explore the associated driving factors. We found an apparent increase in the total area of the lakes (increased by 4616.7 ± 296.3 km2). The increasing trend in lake area has been particularly pronounced in the Tibetan Plateau Lake-zone (TPL) and Xinjiang primarily due to increased precipitation and glacier/snow melting under global warming, although significant downward trends (P <0.05) in lake area occurred in eastern and northeastern China and Inner Mongolia, dominantly driven by anthropogenic activities. There are significant negative relationships between relative lake area and irrigated area, built-up land, and number of water projects in the East and the Northeast China Plain (P <0.05). This study provides a crucial basis for continuous investigation and protection of China's lakes.
