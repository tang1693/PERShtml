                One of the well-known constraints applying to the adoption of consumer-grade digital cameras for photogrammetric measurement is the requirement to record imagery at fixed zoom and focus settings. The camera is then calibrated for the lens setting employed. This requirement arises because calibration parameters vary significantly with zoom/focus setting. In this paper, a zoom-dependent calibration process is proposed whereby the image coordinate correction model for interior orientation and lens distortion is expressed as a function of the focal length written to the EXIF header of the image file. The proposed approach frees the practitioner from the requirement to utilize fixed zoom/focus settings for the images forming the photogrammetric network. Following a review of the behavior of camera calibration parameters with varying zoom settings, an account of the newly developed zoom-dependent calibration model is presented. Experimental results of its application to four digital cameras are analysed. These show that the proposed approach is suited to numerous applications of medium-accuracy, digital, close-range photogrammetry.

            A 16-year Time Series of 1 km AVHRR Satellite Data of the Conterminous United States and Alaska

                The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has developed a 16-year time series of vegetation condition information for the conterminous United States and Alaska using 1 km Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data. The AVHRR data have been processed using consistent methods that account for radiometric variability due to calibration uncertainty, the effects of the atmosphere on surface radiometric measurements obtained from wide field-of-view observations, and the geometric registration accuracy. The conterminous United States and Alaska data sets have an atmospheric correction for water vapor, ozone, and Rayleigh scattering and include a cloud mask derived using the Clouds from AVHRR (CLAVR) algorithm. In comparison with other AVHRR time series data sets, the conterminous United States and Alaska data are processed using similar techniques. The primary difference is that the conterminous United States and Alaska data are at 1 km resolution, while others are at 8 km resolution. The time series consists of weekly and biweekly maximum normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) composites.

            Benthic Habitat Mapping in Tropical Marine Environments Using QuickBird Multispectral Data

                The objective of this research focused on the utility of QuickBird multispectral data for identifying and classifying tropical-marine benthic habitats after applying atmospheric and water-column corrections for an area around Roatan Island, Honduras. Atmospheric (Rayleigh and aerosol path radiance) and water column corrections (water depth and water column attenuation) were applied to the imagery, making it an effective method for mapping benthic habitats. Water depth for each pixel was calculated based on a linear model by regressing transformed radiance over known homogenous benthos against measured depths. Water column correction was achieved by deriving absorption and backscattering coefficients for each band of the image using a 50 Ã— 50 window of clear water pixels. Corrections for water path radiance and water column attenuation of the bottom reflected radiance were made for the entire scene, allowing the bottom albedo to be determined for shallow coastal areas. An image of the bottom (i.e., an albedo image), minus the water column, was produced. Albedos were 8 percent for seagrass benthos, approximately 8 to 18 percent for coral areas, and 18 percent for sand dominated areas. An unsupervised classification algorithm was applied to the bottom albedo image, generating a classified map of benthic habitats. Accuracy assessment based on 383 reference points revealed an overall accuracy of 81 percent, with an overall Kappa value of 0.774.

                Accurate registration of airborne images is challenging because complex local geometric distortions are often involved in image acquisition. In this paper, we propose a solution to this registration problem in two parts. First, we present an area-based method to extract sufficient numbers of well-located control points, and second, we use the extracted control points with local transformation models to register multi-temporal airborne images. The proposed image registration methods were applied to two airborne images with complex local distortion. Performance was evaluated and compared using different transformation models (global models and local models), different numbers of control points, and different similarity measures (correlation coefficient and mutual information). The results showed that local models outperformed global models, more control points could significantly improve local transformation models but not on the global transformation models, and two similarity measures performed similarly. These results revealed two important findings: first, the area-based methods generated larger amounts of evenly distributed control points; and second, local transformation models achieved better registration accuracy when larger amount of evenly distributed control points are used. We concluded that the combination of area-based control point extraction with local transformation models is effective for the registration of airborne images with complex local distortion.

                In this paper, we address the orientation of ground-level motion imagery captured by sensors roaming in an urban area. We investigate the use of building faÃ§ades (instead of traditional points), as matching features for ground-level motion imagery orientation. We assume a situation where few images in our sequence are already absolutely oriented, and present a novel approach to orient all remaining in-between image sequences relative to them. This innovative version of dependent orientation allows us to propagate orientation information within sequences of ground level imagery, establishing a novel orientation scheme. Experimental results show accuracies on the order of 0.18 to 0.29 degrees in rotation estimation, and 0.17 to 0.29 meters in camera position determination.

                Long time series of well-calibrated and consistent daily remote sensing data are important for studies of intra- and inter-annual environmental behavior. These data are used to support environmental management, and in most locations are the only historical spatial dataset. The Web-CATS (CSIRO AVHRR Time Series) system provides access to the Australasian Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data archive using the World Wide Web. The data archive consists of multiple daily satellite overpasses from several receiving stations in Australia since July 1981. The data are held online enabling the use of state-of-the-art algorithms to generate on-demand user-customized products. This novel design for operational and dynamic remote sensing data product generation enables Web-CATS users to browse the entire metadata-database and produce consistent time series information from on-line data in near real time. As these algorithms improve, users have the ability to easily re-process their dataset(s).

            Quantifying DEM Uncertainty and its Effect on Topographic Parameters

                Digital elevation models (DEMs) are representations of topography with inherent errors that constitute uncertainty.DEM data are often used in analyses without quantifying the effects of these errors. This paper describes a Monte Carlo methodology for evaluation of the effects of uncertainty on elevation and derived topographic parameters. Four methods for representing DEM uncertainty that utilize meta-data and spatial characteristics of a DEM are presented. Seven statistics derived from simulation results were used to quantify the effect of DEM error. When uncertainty was quantified by the average relative absolute difference, elevation did not deviate. The range of deviation across the four methods for slope was 5 to 8 percent, 460 to 950 percent for derived catchment areas and 4 to 9 percent for the topographic index. This research demonstrates how application of this methodology can address DEM uncertainty, contributing to more responsible use of elevation and derived topographic parameters, and ultimately results obtained from their use.
