                As a basic asset of highways, guardrails are essential objects in the digital modeling of highways. Therefore, generating the vectorial 3D trajectory of a guardrail from mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds is required for real digital modeling. However, most methods limit straight-line guardrails without considering the continuity and accuracy of the guardrails in turnoff and bend areas; thus, a completed 3D trajectory of a guardrail is not available. We use RANDLA-Net for extracting guardrails as preprocessing of MLS point clouds. We perform a region growth strategy based on linear constraints to obtain correct instantiations and a forward direction. The improved Douglas– Puke algorithm is used to simplify the center points of guardrail, and the 3D trajectory of every guardrail can be vectorized using cubic spline curve fitting. The proposed approach is validated on two 3-km case data sets that can completely instantiate MLS point clouds with remarkable effects. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed guardrail instantiation algorithm achieves an overall precision and recall of 98.80% and 97.5%, respectively. The generated 3D trajectory can provide a high-precision design standard for the 3D modeling of the guardrail and has been applied to a long highway scene.

                Cultural heritage (CH) aims to create new strategies and policies for adapting to climate change. Additionally, the goals of sustainable development aim to protect, monitor, and preserve the world's CH and to take urgent action to combat climate change and its effects. Therefore, developing efficient and accurate techniques toward making CH climate neutral and more resilient is of vital importance. This study aims to provide a holistic solution to monitor and protect CHfrom climate change, natural hazards, and anthropogenic effects in a sustainable way. In our study, the efficiency of deep learning using low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles and camera images for the documentation and monitoring of CHis investigated. The dense extreme inception network for edge detection and richer convolu- tional feature architectures have been used for the first time in the literature to extract contours and cracks from CHstructures. As a result of the study, F1 scores of 61.38% and 61.50% for both architectures, respectively, were obtained. The results show that the proposed solution can aid in monitoring the protection of CHfrom climate change, natural disasters, and anthropogenic effects.

            Validation of Island 3D-mapping Based on UAV Spatial Point Cloud Optimization: a Case Study in Dongluo Island of China

                The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing is of small volume, low cost, fine timeliness, and high spatial resolution, and has the special advantage on island surveying. Focus on the inaccurate elevation of non-ground point cloud without lidar device, this study explored a methodology for island three-dimensional (3D) mapping and modelling based on spatial point clouds optimization with a K-Nearest Neighbors Adaptive Inverse Distance Weighted (K-AIDW) interpolation algorithm. By classifying the UAV point clouds into ground, vegatetation, and structure, the K-AIDW algorithm was applied to optimize the elevations of non-ground point clouds (vegetation and structure) to recalculate Z values. The aerophotogrammetry result was generated based on the optimized spatial point clouds. Finally, the 3D model of Dongluo Island was reconstructed and rendered in Metashape. The accuracy evaluation result shows that the max-errors of ground control points (–0.0154 in X, 0.0305 in Y, and 0.0133 in Z) and the checkpoints (–0.091 in X, –0.176 in Y, and 0.338 in Z) can meet the error-tolerance requirements of the corresponding terrain on the 1:500 scale set by the national standard of GB/T 23236-2009 in China. It is found that the K-AIDW algorithm displayed the best Z accuracy (root-mean-square error of 0.2538) compared with IDW (0.3668) and no-optimized (1.6012), proving it is an effective methodology for improving 3D-modelling accuracy of island.

                Remote sensing scene images are characterized by intra-class diversity and inter-class similarity. When recognizing remote sensing images, traditional image classification algorithms based on deep learning only extract the global features of scene images, ignoring the important role of local key features in classification, which limits the ability of feature expression and restricts the improvement of classification accuracy. Therefore, this paper presents a multi-channel attention fusion network (MCAFNet). First, three channels are used to extract the features of the image. The channel "spatial attention module" is added after the maximum pooling layer of two channels to get the global and local key features of the image. The other channel uses the original model to extract the deep features of the image. Second, features extracted from different channels are effectively fused by the fusion module. Finally, an adaptive weight loss function is designed to automatically adjust the losses in different types of loss functions. Three challenging data sets, UC Merced Land-Use Dataset (UCM), Aerial Image Dataset (AID), and Northwestern Polytechnic University Dataset (NWPU), are selected for the experiment. Experimental results show that our algorithm can effectively recognize scenes and obtain competitive classification results.
