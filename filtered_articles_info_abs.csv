Accuracy Assessment of Dense Point Cloud Generated by Deep Learning and Semiglobal Matching,"Sadeq, Haval Abduljabbar",pp. 153-162(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000003/art00010;jsessionid=ij66bl01dbpe.x-ic-live-01,"This study assesses two techniques for generating point clouds based on dense image matching (DIM): semiglobal matching (SGM) implemented in Trimble INPHO MATCH-3DX software, and a deep-learning algorithm Pyramid Stereo Matching Network (PSMNet). The PSMNet was trained using three datasets with both automated driving and aerial scenes. Two other distinctive sites were selected to assess the accuracy against LiDAR data. The study found inaccuracies in the PSMNet point clouds and suggested that SGM could potentially result in a better outcome. However, for flat slab or ground surface, its root-mean-square error is better than SGM. The analysis showed that the SGM analyses favorably remove points on vertical surfaces due to occlusion, while PSMNet incorrectly extrapolate them with slopes. Furthermore, the assessment identified the potential to improve PSMNet by using more or in-distribution training dataset for test (unseen) areas."
A Comparative Study of Deep Learning Methods for Automated Road Network Extraction from High-Spatial-Resolution Remotely Sensed Imagery,"Zhou, Haochen; He, Hongjie; Xu, Linlin; Ma, Lingfei; Zhang, Dedong; Chen, Nan; Chapman, Michael A.; Li, Jonathan",pp. 163-174(12),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000003/art00011;jsessionid=ij66bl01dbpe.x-ic-live-01,"Road network data are crucial for various applications, such as road network planning, traffic control, map navigation, autonomous driving, and smart city construction. Automated road network extraction from high-spatial-resolution remotely sensed imagery has shown promise in road network data construction. In recent years, the advent of deep learning algorithms has pushed road network extraction towards auto - mation, achieving very high accuracy. However, the latest deep learning models are often less applied in the field of road network extraction and lack comparative experiments for guidance. Therefore, this research selected three recent deep learning algorithms, including dense prediction transformer (DPT), SegFormer, SEgmentation TRansformer (SETR), and the classic model fully convolutional network-8s (FCN-8s) for a comparative study. Additionally, this research paper compares three different decoder structures within the SETR model (SETR_naive, SETR_mla, SETR_pup) to investigate the effect of different decoders on the road network extraction task. The experiment is conducted on three commonly used datasets: the DeepGlobe Dataset, the Massachusetts Dataset, and Road Datasets in Complex Mountain Environments (RDCME). The DPT model outperforms other models on the Massachusetts dataset with superior reliability, achieving a high accuracy of 96.31% and excelling with a precision of 81.78% and recall of 32.50%, leading to an F1 score of 46.51%. While SegFormer has a slightly higher F1 score, DPT's precision is particularly valuable for minimizing false positives, making it the most balanced and reliable choice. Similarly, for the DeepGlobe Dataset, DPT achieves an accuracy of 96.76%, precision of 66.12%, recall of 41.37%, and F1 score of 50.89%, and for RDCME, DPT achieves an accuracy of 98.94%, precision of 99.07%, recall of 99.84%, and F1 score of 99.46%, confirming its consistent performance across datasets. This paper provides valuable guidance for future studies on road network extraction techniques using deep learning algorithms."
Real-time Vanishing Point Tracking in Manhattan World Using Improved BaySAC,"Ye, Chenming; Kang, Zhizhong; Cai, Jinhao; Zhu, Longze",pp. 175-186(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2025/00000091/00000003/art00013;jsessionid=ij66bl01dbpe.x-ic-live-01,"Vanishing points provide geometric information about a scene and assist in camera calibration, scene understanding, and 3D reconstruction. The random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm faces challenges of low efficiency and insufficient robustness. With prior information, the Bayesian sample consensus (BaySAC) algorithm can efficiently derive the correct parameters and compensate for the deficiencies of the RANSAC algorithm. This study proposes an improved BaySAC vanish - ing point detection algorithm, which uses a linear grouping strategy to enhance the distribution of inliers across groups and accelerate convergence. In the continuous frame vanishing point tracking problem, the detection result of the previous frame is employed as a priori infor - mation for the subsequent frames, facilitating efficient convergence for vanishing point detection and tracking in videos. Experimental results on both benchmark datasets and real-world image sets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves remarkable accuracy and efficiency, enabling real-time performance for vanishing point detection and track- ing.

Realizing the potential of remote sensing in forest fire management, a study was taken up to investigate the spatiotemporal behavior of active forest fires in a mountainous terrain of Uttarakhand State, north India, using 15 years' time-series historical MODIS (C6) active fire point products. Results indicate an over-all fire incidence detection accuracy of 62.3% with a KHAT value of 0.59. Moreover, a regular trend in intra-annual behavior in fire incidences with peaks during the hot and dry period of the year was observed and a large year-to-year variability in fire regimes with no significant trends over time could be noticed. The approach and results are discussed in detail along with the future perspective."

We used multispectral Harmonized Landsat 8 Sentinel-2 (HLS) 30-m data in an artificial neural network (ANN) multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model to classify five crop classes (cotton, alfalfa, tree crops, grapes, and others) in California's Central Valley. The ANN MLP model, trained on 2021 data from the United States Department of Agriculture's Cropland Data Layer, was validated by classifying crops for an independent year, 2022. Across the five crop classes, the overall accuracy was 74%. Producer's and user's accuracies ranged from 65% to 87%, with cotton achieving the highest accuracies. The study highlights the potential of using deep learning with HLS time series data for accurate global crop classification."

In this study, we developed a climbing algorithm and combined it with a deep learning model to extract forests and achieve individual tree segmentation using lidar point clouds. We tested the algorithm on mixed forests within complex environments scanned by unmanned aircraft system lidar in ecological restoration mining areas along the Yangtze River of China. Quantitative assessments of the segmentation results showed that the forest extraction achieved a kappa coefficient of 0.88, and the individual tree segmentation results achieved F-scores ranging from 0.86 to 1. The climbing algorithm successfully reduced false positives and false negatives with the increased crown overlapping and outperformed the widely used top-down region-growing point cloud segmentation method. The results indicate that the climbing algorithm proposed in this study will help solve the overlapped crown problem of tree segmentation under complex environments."

However, ships in remote sensing images are so small that it leads to a high detection leakage rate and excessive model parameters, making them difficult to apply on remote sensing equipment with limited resources. To address the challenge, we propose a light-weight ship object detection algorithm, adaptive layered multi-scale You Only Look Once version 8 (ALM-YOLOv8), based on multi-scale perception and feature enhancement. To enhance the model's perception of contextual information in complex backgrounds, a multi-scale channel fusion module is constructed to extract features of various scales. To enhance the extracted features, a small-object detection layer and a dynamic channel attention convolution that assigns dynamic weights are proposed. Additionally, this study embeds the large separable kernel attention mechanism into the original network, which lightens the model. Experiments on the HRSC2016 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of ALM-YOLOv8."

Transmission corridors located in high mountains and valleys are often threatened by geological disasters, which seriously affect their stable operation. This research investigates the landslide in the Kunming transmission corridor using 79 Sentinel-1A SAR images from July 2020 to October 2021. Using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) methods, deformation changes before the landslide are analyzed. Factors like precipitation, lithology, and vegetation coverage demonstrate a correlation with landslide occurrence. Seasonal variations in deformation were related to precipitation. The landslide's primary causes are attributed to precipitation, carbonate karstification, and vegetation coverage. Ultimately, this research establishes a correlation between deformation changes and influencing factors in the Kunming transmission corridor, contributing to a deeper understanding of landslide evolution and ensuring the corridor's security for sustainable electricity supply and economic development."

To address ideal blocking for large-scale  HRSI object detection, this study uses a novel adaptive orientation object-detection method for largescale HRSIs based on multi-scale block fusion. An adaptive orientation object-detection  framework based on a convolutional neural network is applied to detect diverse objects of large-scale HRSIs through different block scales; average precision (AP) values of diverse object  detection results are calculated at different block scales. Then, block scales matching the largest AP values of diverse objects are determined based on statistical results of the AP  values of the diverse object at different block scales. Finally, object-detection results at block scales matching the largest AP values of diverse objects are fused by the non-maximum  suppression algorithm to achieve large-scale HRSI object-detection results. Experimental findings reveal that the proposed method is better than any single block-scale object-detection  method, resulting in satisfactory large-scale HRSI object-detection results."

Model  pruning and knowledge distillation have been widely used for reducing the complexity and storage cost of neural networks. This study designs the Remote Sensing Object Detection Network  (RSODNet), a lightweight model for remote sensing image object detection, and proposes bridging cross-task distillation network slimming (BCDNS) as a method that integrates model pruning and  knowledge distillation. The experiment results indicate that RSODNet outperforms the YOLOv8 model in various metrics while maintaining almost unchanged Params and calculation volume. The  BCDNS method eliminates redundant channels while preserving a priori knowledge of the initial model intact.

SBAS-InSAR technology analyzes 36 Sentinel-1A im- ages from Wenchuan County, Sichuan Province, China (June 2021 to October 2023), focusing on deformation areas and precipitation data. The CS algorithm optimizes the Elman network's parameters, using SBAS-InSAR data as training samples. Validation shows that: (1) Wenchuan County experiences varied deformation, with Banzi Gully in Miansi Town showing the highest uplift at 183.74 mm/a due to heavy rain. (2) As sample size increases, prediction error decreases and accuracy improves. Predictions suggest ongo- ing uplift at about 4.50 mm per month above Cutou Gully over the next four months, highlighting the need for continued monitoring."

This study relied on remote sensing data to analyze and assess land use and land cover changes in Babil Province, Iraq, over the past two decades. The study focused on identifying the patterns and factors influencing these changes, using Landsat satellite imagery to create digital maps classifying land into four main categories: urban lands, bare soil lands, water bodies, and vegetation lands. The results showed a noticeable expansion of urban lands at the expense of bare soil lands, primarily attributed to population growth, economic development, and improved security conditions. This study underscores the importance of sustainable land management and urban planning in Babil Province. These results highlight the importance of sustainable land management in Babil Province, including sound urban planning considering urban expansion's environmental, social, and economic effects. The classification was implemented using a maximum likelihood classifier, and the accuracy assessment yielded satisfactory results with an overall accuracy of 93.5517%.

Image Fusion in Remote Sensing: An Overview and Meta-Analysis,"Albanwan, Hessah; Qin, Rongjun; Tang, Yang",pp. 755-775(21),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2024/00000090/00000012/art00012;jsessionid=1s0jh9af2hki7.x-ic-live-02,"Remote sensing image fusion is consistently used to turn raw images of different resolutions, sources, and modalities into accurate, complete, and spatiotemporally coherent images. It facilitates downstream applications such as pan sharpening, change detection, and classification. However, image fusion solutions are highly disparate to various remote sensing problems and are often narrowly defined in existing reviews as topical applications (e. g., pan sharpening). Theoretically, image fusion can be applied to any gridded data through pixel-level operations; thus, we expand its scope by comprehensively surveying relevant works. We develop a simple taxonomy for many-to-one and many-to-many image fusion, defining it as a mapping problem turning one or multiple images into another set based on desired coherence. Furthermore, we provide a meta-analysis to cover 10,420 peer-reviewed papers from the 1980s to 2023 studying various types of image fusion and their applications. Finally, we discuss image fusion's benefits and emerging challenges to provide open research directions."
Morphology-Based Feature Extraction Network for Arbitrary-Oriented SAR Vehicle Detection,"Chen, Ting; Huang, Xiaohong",pp. 665-673(9),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2024/00000090/00000011/art00010;jsessionid=14omp5r9urmp2.x-ic-live-02,"In recent years, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) vehicle detection has become a research hotspot. However, algorithms using horizontal bounding boxes can lead to redundant detection areas due to the varying aspect ratio and arbitrary orientation of vehicle targets. This paper proposes a morphology-based feature extraction network (MFE-Net), which fully uses the prior shape knowledge of the vehicle targets. Specifically, we adopt rotatable bounding boxes to predict the targets, and a novel rectangular rotation-invariant coordinate convolution (RRICC) is proposed to extract the feature, which can determine more accurately the convolutional sampling location of the vehicles. The adaptive thresholding denoising module (ATDM) is designed to suppress background clutter. Furthermore, inspired by the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and self-attention, we propose the hybrid representation enhancement module (HREM) to highlight the vehicle target features. The experiment results show that the proposed model obtains an average precision (AP) of 93.1% on the SAR vehicle detection data set (SVDD)."

Then, a novel middle-cross attention fusion block that includes middle features fusion strategy and cross-attention is proposed to fuse spatial-spectral features to enhance their mutual effects, which aims to explore the spatial-spectral structural correlations. Finally, we propose a spectral feature compensation mechanism to provide complementary information for adjacent band groups.

We investigated two new-generation hyperspectral sensors, Germany’s Deutsches Zentrum für Luft‐ und Raumfahrt Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer (DESIS) and Italy’s PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA), within California's Central Valley in August 2021 focusing on five irrigated agricultural crops (alfalfa, almonds, corn, grapes, and pistachios). With reference data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Cropland Data Layer, we developed a spectral library of the crops and classified them using three machine learning algorithms (support vector machines [SVM], random forest [RF], and spectral angle mapper [SAM]) and two philosophies: 1. Full spectral analysis (FSA) and 2. Optimal hyperspectral narrowband (OHNB) analysis. For FSA, we used 59 DESIS four-bin product bands and 207 of 238 PRISMA bands. For OHNB analysis, 9 DESIS and 16 PRISMA nonredundant OHNBs for studying crops were selected. FSA achieved only 1% to 3% higher accuracies relative to OHNB analysis in most cases. SVM provided the best results, closely followed by RF. Using both DESIS and PRISMA image OHNBs in SVM for classification led to higher accuracy than using either image alone, with an overall accuracy of 99%, producer’s accuracies of 94% to 100%, and user???s accuracies of 95% to 100%."

Most data-driven deep networks extract features of hyperspectral images (HSIs) by stacking convolutional layers to achieve endmember extraction and abundance estimation. Some model-driven networks have strong interpretability but fail to mine the deep feature. We propose a variable-iterative fully convolutional neural network (VIFCNN) for sparse unmixing, combining the characteristics of these two networks. Under the model-driven iterative framework guided by sparse unmixing by variable splitting and augmented lagrangian (SUnSAL), a data-driven spatial-spectral feature learning module and a spatial information updating module are introduced to enhance the learning of data information. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets show that VIFCNN significantly outperforms several traditional unmixing methods and two deep learning-based methods. On real datasets, our method improves signal-to-reconstruction error by 17.38%, reduces abundance root-mean-square error by 25.24%, and reduces abundance spectral angle distance by 31.40% compared with U-ADMM-ßUNet."

Teacher-Student Prototype Enhancement Network for a Few-Shot Remote Sensing Scene Classification,"Zhu, Ye; Yang, Shanying; Yu, Yang",pp. 621-630(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2024/00000090/00000010/art00012;jsessionid=aquop0b2dnehl.x-ic-live-02,"Few-shot remote sensing scene classification identifies new classes from limited labeled samples where the great challenges are intraclass diversity, interclass similarity, and limited supervision. To alleviate these problems, a teacher-student prototype enhancement network is proposed for a few-shot remote sensing scene classification. Instead of introducing an attentional mechanism in mainstream studies, a prototype enhancement module is recommended to adaptively select high-confidence query samples, which can enhance the support prototype representations to emphasize intraclass and interclass relationships. The construction of a few-shot teacher model generates more discriminative predictive representations with inputs from many labeled samples, thus providing a strong supervisory signal to the student model and encouraging the network to achieve accurate classification with a limited number of labeled samples. Extensive experiments of four public datasets, including NWPU-remote sens ing image scene classification (NWPU-RESISC45), aerial image dataset (AID), UC Merced, and WHU-RS19, demonstrate that this method achieves superior competitive performance than the state-of-the-art methods on five-way, one-shot, and five-shot classifications."

Accurate mapping of riverbank lines is essential for restoration and preservation. This paper presents a method to map riverbank lines by combining georeferenced orthoimages and lidar digital elevation model (DEM). This method uses the properties that lidar can provide elevations under trees and open water edges are visible in orthoimages to extract the planimetric locations of bank lines. The orthoimage pixels with less than 0.15% slope on the DEM were replaced by water pixels. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted using DEM, slope, and orthoimage bands. Training data of river body and the background were identified manually on the first three component images.

To develop the method, a moving image was captured while the crane was slewed with a monocular camera mounted vertically downward at the tip of the crane. The boom length and angle data were output from a control device, a controller area network. For efficient development, a simulator that imitated the environment of an actual machine was developed and used. The proposed method uses optical flow to track feature points. The classification was performed successfully, independent of derricking motion. Consequently, the proposed method contributes to stable 3D mapping around cranes in construction sites."

In recent years, deep learning–based point cloud semantic segmentation methods have received extensive attention from researchers. Multi-scale neighborhood feature learning methods are suitable for inhomogeneous density point clouds, but different scale branching feature learning increases the computational complexity and makes it difficult to accurately fuse different scale features to express local information. In this study, a point cloud semantic segmentation network based on RandLA-Net with multi-scale local feature aggregation and adaptive fusion is proposed. The designed structure can reduce computational complexity and accurately express local features. The mean intersection-over-union is improved by 1.1% on the SemanticKITTI data set with an inference speed of nine frames per second, while the mean intersection-over-union is improved by 0.9% on the S3DIS data set, compared with RandLA-Net. We also conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the proposed key structure."

It is well known and mathematically proven that additional parameters (APs) can compensate image distortions and remaining error sources by a rigorous photogrammetric bundle-block adjustment. Thus, kernel functions based on orthogonal wavelets (e. g., asymmetric Daubechies wave- lets, least asymmetric Daubechies wavelets, Battle-Lemarié wavelets, Meyer wavelets) are used to build the wavelets-based family of APs for self-calibrating digital frame cameras. These new APs are called wavelet APs. Its applications in rigorous tests are accomplished by using aerial images taken by an airborne digital mapping camera in situ and practical calibrations. The test results demonstrate that these orthogonal wavelet APs are applicable and largely avoid the risk of over-parameterization. Their external accuracy is evaluated using reliable and high precision check points in the calibration field."

Many researchers have developed spectrum libraries based on the actual aging of asphalt pavements, and it is possible to construct pavement health indices based on spectrum changes. Some indexes can extract different aging degrees of asphalt pavement from optical satellite images. Of course, current research can only preliminarily reflect the aging phenomenon of asphalt pavement and cannot accurately describe the distress characteristics of asphalt pavement.

In this study, a method for detecting building shadows in GF‐2 images based on improved quick shift was proposed. First, six feature variables were constructed: first principal component (PC1), brightness component (I), normalized difference shadow index (NDSI), morphological shadow index (MSI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Then, the image was segmented to obtain homogeneous objects, which were then classified using a random forest model. Two improvements were added to the quick shift algorithm: using PC1, I, and MSI as input data instead of RGB images; and adding Canny edge constraints. Validation in six research areas yields Kappa coefficients of 0.928, 0.896, 0.89, 0.913, 0.879, and 0.909, confirming method feasibility.

Diverse geological processes generate irregular alteration patterns with diverse spectral characteristics in mineral deposits. Applying remotely sensed hyperspectral images (HSIs) is an appealing technology for geologic surveyors to generate alteration maps. Conventional methods mainly use shallow spectral absorption features to discriminate minerals and cannot extract their important spectral information. Deep neural networks with nonlinear layers can evoke the deep spectral and spatial information of HSIs. Deep learning-based methods include fully connected neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and hybrid convolutional networks like mixed convolution neural network and covariance pooling (MCNN‐CP) algorithms. However, each has its advantages and limitations. To significantly avoid losing important spectral features, we proposed a new method by fusing a one‐dimensional convolutional neural network (1D‐CNN) with MCNN‐CP (1D‐MCNN‐CP), achieving an overall accuracy (97.44%) of mineral mapping from PRISMA HSIs. This research deduced that 1D‐MCNN‐CP improved performance and reduced misclassification errors among minerals sharing similar spectral features."

The fusion performance is compared with classical signal processing-based image fusion techniques. Four image metrics are used for the quantitative evaluation of the fused images. The proposed network improved fusion ability by reducing the root mean square error and relative dimensionless global error in synthesis and increased the peak signal-to-noise ratio when compared to other state-of-the-art models.

In this paper, we used two interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) methods, permanent scatterer (PS)-InSAR and small baseline subset (SBAS)- InSAR, to analyze deformation signals in the area in the 2 years leading up to the landslide event using Sentinel-1A ascending data. Our experimental findings from PS-InSAR and SBAS-InSAR revealed that the deformation rates in the study region ranged between –50 to 20 mm/year and –30 to 10 mm/year, respectively. Furthermore, the deformation rates of the same points, as determined by these methods, exhibited a significant increase prior to the event. We also investigated the causal relationship between rainfall and landslide events, demonstrating that deformation rates correlate with changes in rainfall, albeit with a time lag. Therefore, using time-series InSAR for landslide monitoring in Xinmo Village is a viable approach."

Therefore alternative solutions have been sought that are both cost-effective and suitable for nonprofessional use. A review of the literature shows that researchers primarily use GoPro action cameras, while other action cameras with similar capabilities are rarely used. This study thus examines underwater photogrammetry methods using a widely recognized action camera as a reference and compares it with another camera of similar characteristics as a potential alternative. For a comprehensive temporal analysis in underwater studies, both cameras were used to capture photographic and video imagery, and the resulting 3D point clouds were compared. Comparison criteria included data collection and processing times, point cloud densities, cloud-to-cloud analysis, and assessments of surface density and roughness. Having analysed, the study concluded that the proposed alternative action camera can feasibly be used in underwater photogrammetry."

One factor influencing point density and spacing in lidar data is the presence of empty pulses, where no return is detected. Missing returns can occur due to atmospheric absorption, specular and diffusive reflection, etc. To address this issue and enhance point density, this paper introduces a novel method for approximating missing returns in airborne lidar data collected over urban areas. This technique focuses on approximating returns for empty pulses that hit spots near abrupt slope changes on building and ground surfaces. The proposed methodology is validated through experiments using a lidar data set from downtown Dublin, Ireland. The collected data contained numerous gaps associated with wet surfaces, as well as missing returns on vertical and oblique surfaces."

We first implement a gradient-based mutual information method to filter out low-quality frames while preserving the integrity of the videos. After frame pose estimation, the geometric properties of the baseline are constrained by three aspects to extract the keyframes: quality of relative orientation, baseline direction, and base to distance ratio. The three-dimensional model is then reconstructed based on these extracted keyframes. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach maintains a strong robustness throughout the aerial triangulation, leading to high levels of reconstruction precision across diverse video scenarios. Compared to other methods, this paper improves the reconstruction accuracy by more than 0.2 mm while simultaneously maintaining the completeness."

However, in some applications, dense point cloud has no practical meaning. How to effectively sample from the dense points and maximize the preservation of terrain features is extremely important. This paper will propose a DEM sampling algorithm that utilizes terrain complexity and maximal Poisson-disk sampling to extract key feature points for adaptive DEM sampling. The algorithm estimates terrain complexity based on local terrain variation and prioritizes points with high complexity for sampling. The sampling radius is inversely proportional to terrain complexity, while ensuring that points within the radius of accepted samples are not considered new samples. This way makes more points of concern in the rugged regions. The results show that the proposed algorithm has higher global accuracy than the classic six sampling methods."
I2-FaçadeNet: An Illumination-invariant Façade Recognition Network Leveraging Sparsely Gated Mixture of Multi-color Space Experts for Aerial Oblique Imagery,"Huang, Shengzhi; Hu, Han; Zhu, Qing",pp. 21-31(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2024/00000090/00000001/art00008;jsessionid=1qdsoclrrqjs9.x-ic-live-01,"Façade image recognition under complex illumination conditions is crucial for various applications, including urban three-dimensional modeling and building identification. Existing methods relying solely on Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images are prone to texture ambiguity in complex illumination environments. Furthermore, façades display varying orientations and camera viewing angles, resulting in performance issues within the RGB color space. In this study, we introduce an illumination-invariant façade recognition network (I2-FaçadeNet) that leverages sparsely gated multi-color space experts for enhanced façade image recognition in challenging illumination environments. First, RGB façade images are converted into multi-color spaces to eliminate the ambiguous texture in complex illumination. Second, we train expert networks using separate channels of multi-color spaces. Finally, a sparsely gated mechanism is introduced to manage the expert networks, enabling dynamic activation of expert networks and the merging of results. Experimental evaluations leveraging both the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing benchmark data sets and the Shenzhen data sets reveal that our proposed I2-FaçadeNet surpasses various depths of ResNet in façade recognition under complex illumination conditions. Specifically, the classification accuracy for poorly illuminated façades in Zurich improves by nearly 8%, while the accuracy for over-illuminated areas in Shenzhen increases by approximately 3%. Moreover, ablation studies conducted on façade images with complex illumination indicate that compared to traditional RGB-based ResNet, the proposed network achieves an accuracy improvement of 3% to 4% up to 100% for overexposed images and an accuracy improvement of 3% to 10% for underexposed images."

Fast-growing tropical cities particularly call for an understanding of this phenomenon, known as the urban heat island (UHI). The present study was conducted to detect UHI dynamics over the National Capital Region of India. Stretching over more than 32 000 km2, this region consists of urban centers of varying sizes. Landsat thermal bands were processed to extract temperature patterns between 1999 and 2019. Urban climate change was prominent, as a 2349-km2expansion in UHI area was spotted. Urban clusters of different sizes were demarcated by applying the k-nearest neighbor algorithm on the normalized difference building index maps. This empirical analysis helped to form a logarithmic relation between city size and UHI intensity. Observed results set a framework to assess the thermal environment of numerous urban centers from any tropical country. UHI intensity values for various city sizes were computed, as they were crucial to decide the outdoor comfort zones based on the base temperature conditions of other cities. Further, the critical zones in each urban cluster were identified using the vegetation index, and scopes of landscaping were suggested based on the observed building morphologies of different local climate zones."

The footprints left by the robot arm after touching the ground are regarded as the lunar control points. A stereo constraint is proposed, and a combined adjustment model is established. The accuracy of the proposed method is verified by Earth-based and lunar experiments. In the Earth-based experiment, the proposed method obtained a 3.18 mm average positioning error in 50 sets of tests, the average residual error of nine footprints was 0.45 pixels, and the unit weight mean square error of Moncam B was 0.181 pixels. In the lunar experiment, the proposed method obtained a 3.22 mm average positioning error in 50 sets of tests, and the unit weight mean-square error of Moncam B was 0.172 pixels. The experimental results show that the proposed method provides high accuracy and stability."
Mapping Lotus Wetland Distribution with the Phenology Normalized Lotus Index Using SAR Time-Series Imagery and the Phenology-Based Method,"Wang, Sheng; Wu, Taixia; Shen, Qiang",pp. 601-611(11),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2023/00000089/00000010/art00006;jsessionid=88gli7sf70b4o.x-ic-live-02,"Lotus wetland is a type of wetland that can efficiently purify water. Therefore, rapid and accurate remote sensing monitoring of the distribution of lotus wetland has great significance to their conservation and the promotion of a sustainable and healthy development of ecosystems. The phenology-based method has proven effective in mapping some different types of wetlands. However, because of the serious absence of remote sensing data caused by cloud coverage and the differences in the phenological rhythms of lotus wetlands in different areas, achieving high-precision mapping of different regions using a unified approach is a challenge. To address the issue, this article proposes a Phenology Normalized Lotus Index (PNLI) model that combines SAR time-series imagery and the phenology-based method. The results of this study demonstrate that the PNLI model shows good applicability in different areas and has high mapping accuracy. The model can map the lotus wetland distribu tion in large areas quickly and simultaneously with high precision."
The FABDEM Outperforms the Global DEMs in Representing Bare Terrain Heights,"Osama, Nahed; Shao, Zhenfeng; Freeshah, Mohamed",pp. 613-624(12),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2023/00000089/00000010/art00007;jsessionid=88gli7sf70b4o.x-ic-live-02,"Many remote sensing and geoscience applications require a high-precision terrain model. In 2022, the Forest And Buildings removed Copernicus digital elevation model (FABDEM) was released, in which trees and buildings were removed at a 30 m resolution. Therefore, it was necessary to make a comprehensive evaluation of this model. This research aims to perform a qualitative and quantitative analysis of fabdem in comparison with the commonly used global dems. We investigated the effect of the terrain slope, aspect, roughness, and land cover types in causing errors in the topographic representation of all dems. The fabdem had the highest overall vertical accuracy of 5.56 m. It was the best dem in representing the terrain roughness. The fabdem and Copernicus dem were equally influenced by the slopes more than the other models and had the worst accuracy of slope representation. In the tree, built, and flooded vegetation areas of the fabdem, the mean errors in elevation have been reduced by approximately 3.34 m, 1.26 m and 1.55 m, respectively. Based on Welch's t-test, there was no significant difference between fabdem and Copernicus dem elevations. However, the slight improvements in the fabdem make it the best filtered dem to represent the terrain heights over different land cover types."
Evaluating Surface Mesh Reconstruction Using Real Data,"Marchand, Yanis; Caraffa, Laurent; Sulzer, Raphael; Clédat, Emmanuel; Vallet, Bruno",pp. 625-638(14),Open Access content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2023/00000089/00000010/art00008;jsessionid=88gli7sf70b4o.x-ic-live-02,"Surface reconstruction has been studied thoroughly, but very little work has been done to address its evaluation. In this article, we propose new visibility-based metrics to assess the completeness and accuracy of three-dimensional meshes based on a point cloud of higher accuracy than the one from which the reconstruction has been computed. We use the position from which each high-quality point has been acquired to compute the corresponding ray of free space. Based on the intersections between each ray and the reconstructed surface, our metrics allow evaluating both the global coherency of the reconstruction and the accuracy at close range. We validate this evaluation protocol by surveying several open-source algorithms as well as a piece of licensed software on three data sets. The results confirm the relevance of assessi ng local and global accuracy separately since algorithms sometimes fail at guaranteeing both simultaneously. In addition, algorithms making use of sensor positions perform better than the ones relying only on points and normals, indicating a potentially significant added value of this piece of information. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/umrlastig/SurfaceReconEval."

The relationship between urban and rural vegetation phenology and environmental and meteorological factors were studied across urban-rural gradients. However, the relationship of intra-urban urbanization intensity (UI) gradients on vegetation at the start of season (SOS) is unclear. Here, we used remote sensing data to quantitatively assess the relationship of vegetation SOS to UI gradients at mid-high latitudes in the northern hemisphere. The results showed that urban area vegetation SOS widely presented earlier than for rural area vegetation. Across the cities we investigated the extent UI gradient was prevalent as a threshold (33.2% ± 2.3%) of surface temperature to SOS advance enhancement and offset. At low urbanization enhanced surface temperature on sos advances, while at high urbanization offset surface temperature on SOS advances. Overall, UI demonstrated a nonlinear relationship with sos. The results of this study suggest that there may be thresholds of impact on vegetation SOS in future global climate and environment change processes, where opposite effects can occur below and above thresholds."

Although the geocentric coordinates (X, Y, Z) of two datums can be trans- formed using the 7-parameters method, the conversion of Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projected coordinates (E, N) between two systems cannot be applied with the same procedure. However, see Jassim (2022), which discusses a method that allows the transformation between any two datums using the utm projected coordinates directly regarding the variation of the datum's semi-major axis and the eccentricity. The results of the evaluation of this method show that there is a significant shift in the transformed coordinates due to the imperfection of the used algorithm. While this research suggests a modification in the previous algorithm by adding the latitude's variation as a third significant factor besides the other two variations (∂a, ∂e2, and Δ), the suggested modification gives a high decline in the uncertainty of the position values. Furthermore, it takes a homogenous fixed limit for different places over Iraqi territory."

As an example, an approach is suggested by combining the constant false alarm ratio (CFAR) detector and the hysteresis thresholding. After thinning edges obtained by the CFAR detector, the hysteresis thresholding is employed to reduce edge streaking, which is caused by abundant speckles. A ratio of the high to the low threshold Pfain the hysteresis thresholding is pointed out for linking edges. Experiments are carried out on both simulated and real PolSAR data sets, and the results reveal that hysteresis thresh- olding obviously promotes the performance of the CFAR detector."

Using a random forest (RF)- supervised machine-learning algorithm, we present a geographic object-based image analysis approach to classifying a large mosaic of 220 National Agriculture Imagery Program orthoimagery into lulc categories. The approach was applied in central Texas, USA, covering over 6000 km2. We generated 36 variables for each object and accounted for spatial structures of sample data to determine the distance at which samples were spatially independent. The final rf model produced 94.8% accuracy on independent stratified random samples. In addition, vegetation and water indices, the mean and standard deviation of principal components, and texture features improved classification accuracy.

Over the past decade, the availability of near- shore bathymetric data has increased dramatically due to advances in satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB). One notable advance occurred with the 2018 launch of NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2), carrying the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS). However, much like other Earth observing satellites, ATLAS is often hampered by obstructions, such as clouds, which block the sensor's view of the Earth's surface. In this study, we introduce the Deep Occlusion Recovery of Satellite Lidar From ICESat-2 Network (DORSL-FIN) to recover partially occluded bathymetric profiles. We show that DORSL-FIN is able to accurately recover occluded bathymetry and outperforms other methods of interpolation."

First, the image is smoothed using the simple linear iterative clustering algorithm to eliminate the influence of image noise and the phenomenon of the same class objects reflecting different spectra on image edge detec - tion. Second, initial edge detection results of the image are obtained using the dual-threshold edge tracking algorithm. Finally, the initial image edge detection results are post-processed by removing the burrs and extracting skeleton lines to obtain accurate edge detection results. The experimental results confirm that the proposed method outperforms the others and can obtain smooth, continuous, and single-pixel response edge detection results for HSRIs ."

Rapid urbanization and population expansion have increased Lahore's urban impervious surface area. This research is based on estimating the urban imper- vious surface area ( uisa ) growth from 1993 to 2022. Therefore, we aimed to generate an accurate urban impervious surfaces area map based on Landsat time series data on Google Earth Engine ( gee ). We have used a novel global impervious surface area index ( gisai ) for impervious surface area ( uisa ) extraction. The gisai accomplished significant results, with an average overall accuracy of 90.93% and an average kappa coefficient of 0.78. We also compared the results of gisai with Global Human Settlement Layer-Built and harmonized nighttime light ( ntl ) isa data products. The accuracy assessment and cross-validation of uisa results were performed using ground truth data on ArcGIS and gee. Our research findings revealed that the spatial extent of uisa increased by 198.69 km2from 1993 to 2022 in Lahore. Additionally, the uisa has increased at an average growth rate of 39.74 km2. The gisai index was highly accurate at extract- ing uisa and can be used for other cities to map impervious surface area growth. This research can help urban planners and policymak- ers to delineate urban development boundaries. Also, there should be controlled urban expansion policies for sustainable metropolis and should use less impermeable materials for future city developments."

The results showed that the values of Precision, Recall, mean Average Precision (mAP)@0.5, and[email protected]:0.95 of the model increased 7.3%, 0.7%, 1%, and 7.2%, respectively on the Common Objects in Context data set in the detection stage; the four values increased 3.1%, 2.2%, 1.3%, and 5.7%, respectively on the custom remote sensing image data set in the verification stage.

Compared with the other papers, the improved model in this paper proved to be better. Artificial poverty alleviation can be replaced by remote sensing image processing because it is inexpensive, efficient, accurate, objective, does not require data, and has the same evaluation effect. The proposed model can be considered as a promising approach in the assessment of regional poverty."

In this paper, we propose an extremely lightweight conditional three-dimensional (3D) hsi with a double-branch structure to solve these problems. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight conditional 3D convolution to replace the conventional 3D convolution to reduce the computational and memory cost of the network and achieve flexiblehsifeature extraction. Then, based on lightweight conditional 3D convolution, we build two parallel paths to independently exploit and optimize the diverse spatial and spectral features. Furthermore, to precisely locate the key information, which is conducive to classification, a lightweight attention mechanism is carefully designed to refine extracted spatial and spectral features, and improve the classification accuracy with less computation and memory costs. Experiments on three publichsidata sets show that the proposed model can effectively reduce the cost of computation and memory, achieve high execution speed, and better classification performance compared with several recent dl-based models."

Validation of the Sentinel-2 AOD retrievals was conducted against four Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET ) sites located in Beijing. The results show that the Sentinel-2 AOD retrievals are highly consistent with the AERONET AOD measurements (R = 0.942), with 85.56% falling within the expected error. The mean absolute error and the root-mean-square error are 0.0688 and 0.0882, respectively. In addition, the AOD distribution map obtained by this algorithm well reflects the fine-spatial-resolution changes in AOD distribution. These results suggest that the improved high-resolution AOD retrieval algorithm is robust and has the potential advantage of retrieving high-resolution AOD over urban areas."

Therefore, this paper proposes a novel method for SAR image change detection based on clustering fusion and deep neural networks. We first used hierarchical fuzzy c-means clustering (HFCM ) to process two different images to obtain HFCM classification results. Then a fusion strategy is designed to obtain the fused image from the two HFCM classified images as the pre-classification result. Furthermore, a lightweight deep neural network com posed of a decomposition convolution module and an auxiliary classification module was proposed; the former module could reduce network parameters by 28%, and the latter could reduce network parameters by 33.3%. To improve the recognition performance of the network, the classification layer was replaced by the regression layer at the outcome of the network.

In this study, four experimental strategies were designed for comparison based on TanDEM-X polarized interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PolInSAR) data, TanDEM-DEM, and 42 field-measured data. Our results show that in the RVoG model, (1) a reference ground phase to select the volume scattering complex coherence provides greater accuracy in determining forest height, (2) forest height estimation can be achieved by directly using DEM as ground phase information without relying on model solving and obtaining a more accurate forest height than TanDEM-X alone, and (3) the highest estimation accuracy is obtained by using DEM as coherence information among all schemes. Although the difference in forest height estimation results is not significant in this study, it still proves that the forest height estimation strategy of high-precision DEM combined with short-wavelength PolInSAR can not only improve the forest height estimation accuracy but also simplify the solving process of the RVoG model, which is an important reference for global forest parameter estimation and ecosystem detection based on spaceborne PolInSAR."

Optimization-based meta-heuristic algorithms ap- pear to be an efficient solution to overcome these limitations. This pa- per presents a complete automated RFM terrain-dependent orthorec- tification for satellite images.

In this stage, a modified K-means clustering selection technique was used to support the proposed algorithm for finding the best combinations of GCPs and RFM coefficients. The obtained results are promising in terms of accuracy and stability compared to other literature methods."
UAS-Based Multi-Temporal Rice Plant Height Change Prediction,"Lin, Yuanyang; He, Jing; Liu, Gang; Mou, Biao; Wang, Bing; Fu, Rao",pp. 301-310(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2023/00000089/00000005/art00011;jsessionid=8odfuefa51kbt.x-ic-live-02,"Analyzing rice growth is essential for examining pests, illnesses, lodging, and yield. To create a Digital Surface Model (DSM ) of three important rice breeding stages, an efficient and fast (compared to manual monitoring) Unoccupied Aerial System was used to collect data. Outliers emerge in DSM as a result of the influence of environ- ment and equipment, and the outliers related to rice not only affect the extraction of rice growth changes but are also more challenging to remove. Therefore, after using ground control points uniform geodetic level for filtering, statistical outlier removal (SOR ) and quadratic surface filtering (QSF ) are used. After that, differential operations are applied to the DSM to create a differential digital surface model that can account for the change in rice plant height. Comparing the prediction accuracy before and after filtering: R2= 0.72, RMSE = 5.13cm, nRMSE = 10.65% for the initial point cloud; after QSF, R2= 0.89, RMSE = 2.51cm, nRMSE = 5.21%; after SOR, R2= 0.92, RMSE = 3.32cm, nRMSE = 6.89%. The findings demonstrate that point cloud filtering, particularly SOR, can increase the accuracy of rice monitoring. The method is effective for monitoring, and after filtering, the accuracy is sufficiently increased to satisfy the needs of growth analysis. This has some potential for application and extension."
Spherical Hough Transform for Robust Line Detection Toward a 2D–3D Integrated Mobile Mapping System,"Zhang, Daiwei; Xu, Bo; Hu, Han; Zhu, Qing; Wang, Qiang; Ge, Xuming; Chen, Min; Zhou, Yan",pp. 311-320(10),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2023/00000089/00000005/art00012;jsessionid=8odfuefa51kbt.x-ic-live-02,"Line features are of great importance for the registration of the Vehicle-Borne Mobile Mapping System that contains both lidar and multiple-lens panoramic cameras. In this work, a spherical straight- line model is proposed to detect the unified line features in the panoramic imaging surface based on the Spherical Hough Transform. The local topological constraints and gradient image voting are also combined to register the line features between panoramic images and lidar point clouds within the Hough parameter space. Experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately extract the long strip targets on the panoramic images and avoid spurious or broken line-segments. Meanwhile, the line matching precision between point clouds and panoramic images are also improved."
Blind and Robust Watermarking Algorithm for Remote Sensing Images Resistant to Geometric Attacks,"Ren, Na; Pang, Xinyan; Zhu, Changqing; Guo, Shuitao; Xiong, Ying",pp. 321-332(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2023/00000089/00000005/art00013;jsessionid=8odfuefa51kbt.x-ic-live-02,"To address the problem of weak robustness against geometric attacks of remote sensing images' digital watermarking, a robust watermark- ing algorithm based on template watermarking is proposed in this paper, which improves the robustness of digital watermarking against geometric attacks by constructing stable geometric attack invari- ant features. In this paper, the Discrete Fourier Transform domain template watermark is used as the invariant feature against geometric attacks, and the embedding of the cyclic watermark is used to improve the watermark robustness for recovering the watermark synchroniza- tion relationship. To achieve blind extraction of the watermark, a parameter extraction method based on noise extraction is designed. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively improve the robustness of digital watermarking of remote sensing images against geometric attacks. Meanwhile, it can also resist common image processing attacks and compound attacks."

In this paper, to improve the efficiency of large-scale bundle adjustment (BA), we propose a combined Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) and Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) parallel computing approach for the BA of large-scale HRSI without GCPs. The proposed approach consists of three main components: 1) construction of a BA model without GCPs ; 2) reduction of memory consumption using the Compressed Sparse Row sparse matrix format; and 3) improvement of the computational efficiency by the use of the combined PCG and GPU parallel computing method. The experimental results showed that the proposed method: 1) consumes less memory consumption compared to the conventional full matrix format method; 2) demonstrates higher computational efficiency than the single-core, Ceres-solver and multi-core central processing unit computing methods, with 9.48, 6.82, and 3.05 times faster than the above three methods, respectively; 3) obtains comparable BA accuracy with the above three methods, with image residuals of about 0.9 pixels; and 4) is superior to the parallel bundle adjustment method in the reprojection error."
Identification of Drought Events in Major Basins of Africa from GRACE Total Water Storage and Modeled Products,"Elameen, Ayman M.; Jin, Shuanggen; Olago, Daniel",pp. 221-232(12),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2023/00000089/00000004/art00009;jsessionid=2fcpkicc259oh.x-ic-live-01,"Terrestrial water storage (TWS) plays a vital role in climatological and hydrological processes. Most of the developed drought indices from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) over Africa neglected the influencing roles of individual water storage components in calculating the drought index and thus may either underestimate or overestimate drought characteristics. In this paper, we proposed a Weighted Water Storage Deficit Index for drought assessment over the major river basins in Africa (i. e., Nile, Congo, Niger, Zambezi, and Orange) with accounting for the contribution of each TWS component on the drought signal. We coupled the GRACE data and WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model through utilizing the component contribution ratio as the weight. The results showed that water storage components demonstrated distinctly different contributions to TWS variability and thus drought signal response in onset and duration. The most severe droughts over the Nile, Congo, Niger, Zambezi, and Orange occurred in 2006, 2012, 2006, 2006, and 2003, respectively. The most prolonged drought of 84 months was observed over the Niger basin. This study suggests that considering the weight of individual components in the drought index provides more reasonable and realistic drought estimates over large basins in Africa from GRACE."
Lightweight Parallel Octave Convolutional Neural Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification,"Li, Dan; Wu, Hanjie; Wang, Yujian; Li, Xiaojun; Kong, Fanqiang; Wang, Qiang",pp. 233-243(11),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2023/00000089/00000004/art00010;jsessionid=2fcpkicc259oh.x-ic-live-01,"Although most deep learning-based methods have achieved excellent performance for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, they are often limited by complex networks and require massive training samples in practical applications. Therefore, designing an efficient, lightweight model to obtain better classification results under small samples situations remains a challenging task. To alleviate this problem, a novel, lightweight parallel octave convolutional neural network (LPOCNN) for HSI classification is proposed in this paper. First, the HSI data is preprocessed to construct two three-dimensional (3D) patch cubes with different spatial and spectral scales for each central pixel, removing redundancy and focusing on extracting spatial features and spectral features, respectively. Next, two non- deep parallel branches are created for the two inputs, which design octave convolution rather than classical 3D convolution to facilitate light weighting of the model. Then two-dimensional convolutional neural network is used to extract deeper spectral-spatial features when fusing spectral-spatial features from different parallel layers. Moreover, the spectral-spatial attention is designed to promote the classification performance even further by adaptively adjusting the weights of different spectral-spatial features according to their contribution to classification. Experiments show that our suggested LPOCNN acquires a significant advantage on classification performance over other competitive methods under small sample situations."
Model-Driven Precise Degradation Analysis Method of Highway Marking Using Mobile Laser Scanning Point Clouds,"Ma, Ruifeng; Ge, Xuming; Zhu, Qing; Jia, Xin; Jiang, Huiwei; Chen, Min; Liu, Tao",pp. 245-258(14),Subscribed content,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asprs/pers/2023/00000089/00000004/art00011;jsessionid=2fcpkicc259oh.x-ic-live-01,"Highway markings (HMs) are representative elements of inventory digitalization in highway scenes. The accurate position, semantics, and maintenance information of HMs provide significant support for the intelligent management of highways. This article presents a robust and efficient approach for extracting, reconstructing, and degrading analyzing HMs in complex highway scenes. Compared with existing road marking extraction methods, not only can extract HMs in presence of wear and occlusion from point clouds, but we also perform a degradation analysis for HMs. First, the HMs candidate area is determined accurately by sophisticated image processing. Second, the prior knowledge of marking design rules and edge-based matching model that leverages the standard geometric template and radiometric appearance of HMs is used for accurately extracting and reconstructing solid lines and nonsolid markings of HMs, respectively. Finally, two degradation indicators are constructed to describe the completeness of the marking contour and consistency within the marking. Comprehensive experiments on two existing highways revealed that the proposed methods achieved an overall performance of 95.4% and 95.4% in the recall and 93.8% and 95.5% in the precision for solid line and nonsolid line markings, respectively, even with imperfect data. Meanwhile, a database can be established to facilitate agencies' efficient maintenance."
